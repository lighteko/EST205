0,"Love!: I am totally addicted to Thredup! I have been shopping on this app for over a year, and most of my wardrobe now consists of these beautiful high end finds. I am very careful when buying and do my best to inspect, via the photos and descriptions, to buy items that will fit and are in good condition. Occasionally items don’t work out and it’s disappointing. I think there are a few things that Thredup can do to help customers choose well. I know they must be overloaded with items from clean out bags. Mistakes in the listings are unavoidable. When they occur, wrong size or a hole in an item listed as “like new” Thredup should waive the restocking fee since you can note these problems in your return. I also wish they would say in the description what size mannequin the item is shown on. I really think it would help since different manufacturers size differently. If I could see if the fit is loose or tight on the mannequin I could make more successful choices. I’ve noticed a size stamped into the back of some of the pant mannequins and it helps. It would also help to state the American size equivalent for foreign sizes. 
On the subject of clean out... beware! We all love free shipping, but you do risk someone in inspection not recognizing the value of an item, especially jewelry.  I sent in a sterling silver designer ring that had the name stamped into the band, and got a good payout. I sent in the matching necklace and earrings in my next clean out bag and they donated it:(",5
1,"My favorite shopping place: I love shopping on this website and I also enjoy this app.  This is my favorite place for finding great deals!  After losing weight I have had to shop and ThredUP has been my go to place for purchasing a new wardrobe at less of a price.  I don’t know about selling and I see many complaints about that.  I had to get rid of tons of clothing and chose to donate them instead.  That has always been my preference whenever getting rid of clothing.  Anyhow, I haven’t been disappointed by my purchases.  There were a couple of items that were supposed to be in excellent condition but I found some seams that had to be repaired since they were coming apart.  Heck that has even happened to me with brand new purchases at department stores.  After making those small repairs myself, the items are now in excellent condition.  I love the coupons/discounts and rewards which I fully take advantage of.  People also complain about smells when receiving clothing and yes I have also experienced that.  I always wash mine whether from ThredUP or any store immediately right after unpacking and I use laundry sanitizer just to be on the safe side.  After washing I no longer notice any strange smells.  I also like that you can search for your favorite brands and you can choose the condition of the item you are purchasing.  I have been using ThredUP for many years (since 2016) and absolutely enjoy it.",5
2,"Replace your Social Media Scrolling..: The only better thrift store is your local store that supports a good cause. ThredUp has anything you might want at a fair price. I’ve purchased the majority of my wardrobe from ThredUp since I discovered it in 2018, and my style is all over the place. Some days I want to be full on goth, some days vintage prairie cute, some days jeans and a tshirt. To be able to support that kind of wardrobe I needed a decent price alternative to regular store and a more ethical and sustainable solution than SHEIN. It’s so nice to be able to get quality clothing and know exactly what to expect in terms of sizing and quality. I spend a lot of time on the app, I’m more of a thrifter than regular shopper, I want to be inspired by my clothes so I never know what I’m looking for.. Here’s some thing I do, if your not familiar with a brand check out their site for an additional size reference. If you’re looking to save extra money, scour that outlet section and favorite items until you get 20+, then you get 40% the already low prices! I have been actively avoiding social media, so I’ve replaced the daily mindless FB scroll with something similar on this app. I’m never in hurry to get items, sometimes the sell before I buy but those must not be meant to be! I have a much more relaxed and well thought out approach to buying because of this app, and it’s carried over to more than just clothes purchases.",5
3,"My Favorite Way to Shop: I’ve been shopping on thredUP for over 2-3 years, and I still love it enough that it’s by far the place I do most of my shopping. That said, I am a little disappointed with a couple changes they have made in the last year or so.  My biggest problem is that they took away the free shipping bonus after spending a certain amount of money in a limited time. I like the bundle option now, but even that requires the initial shipping deposit on your first purchase. I look at items in my favorites list, and saved searches almost every day, and sometimes find one really great piece or something I can’t let slip by. If you’re purchasing one or two things a week it helped to earn that free shipping after hitting the goal so that everything after that for a month didn’t cost $5.99 every single time. 
I also understand the reason for the return fee, but am still a little disappointed when I receive an item that was listed with the measurements I know will fit, and yet it doesn’t. Or in the case of skirts, jackets, and swimsuits, there aren’t really any given. 
The bonus points do help with that, but if I use my $10 off, I still end up paying $5.99 shipping since you can’t combine them. As often as I shop on here, it’s a little disappointing to have the rewards change by taking away a better option and limiting the newer rewards.",5
4,"Like the app: Like the variety.  Like the bundle and save option.  DON’T LIKE  1) how can I get one of many notifications that 30 or more items were added to a sort and I sort by newest and there aren’t thirty new items.  2) have featured items saying “fall dresses” but there are tank dresses and sundresses and so much crap to scroll past that IS NOT fall.  Suggestions  1) I wish that when they mention an item has stains or an issue there would be an additional photos for that item with a focus on what they “saw” as an issue.  2)  need an update to notifications  to give more choices like as uploaded, or three times a day, once a day, or other, when they are uploading all day getting them constantly all day is annoying 3) would love a sort option where you could say “not this filter option” like not wool or ... 4) would love to have a saved searches on the main menu no buried where it currently is.  5) would be nice if they had suggestions based on style and brand types that I purchase that I could look at that might have similar items but in a brand that I hadn’t purchased or searched before or not.  6) in the searches (small, medium, 6 & 8 as an example) when it filters/Sorts bysizes. Could there be an additional choice to the  sort to group  them together so using my sort..all smalls display together 
, then mediums, size 6s, then 8s. Sure there are more suggestions..email if you want them",5
5,"Mostly Awesome!: Okay, so I may have a problem. I’m a serial thred-up thrifter now. Despite all its hype, i never enjoyed thrifting because it always felt overwhelming with the endless amount of clothes to sift through. I was inspired to give thred-up a try and am so glad I did. I’ve made it a habit that anytime I want to buy a specific type of clothing I will check thred-up first. I am really only into Madewell right now and I find a lot of gems for affordable prices. I like that you can save your searches (favorite brands) so that you can stay up-to-date with what is being added to the collection. Here are my only complaints: Make no mistake, ThredUp doesn’t have true thrift-store prices, but it’s really great for discounted designer & mid-tier brands. If you sell your clothes on consignment, they do take a large portion of the sale. They auto-set prices so they up-charge pieces often more than they’re worth, but you can go in and edit the price to what you want. It also takes SO LONG for them to sort through your items, get them listed, and to actually see the credit on your account—like months and months. I sent in some items in February 2022. I didn’t see my items posted until July 2022. Some of my items have sold and the larger payouts have yet to be distributed into my account, but I’ve received payouts for smaller sales. All in all, I do love shopping on the app and definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to be a more conscious consumer!",4
6,"Overall very happy!: I’ve been buying and selling clothes for months and have had overall a very positive experience!! The vast majority of the items I’ve bought online have fit me as expected. The app for a long time had a glitch that didn’t save items to favorites but that has been fixed so now I think the app is great. It takes a really long time to process a bag once they’ve received it (I have two bags they received over a month ago and haven’t processed yet). However, I know they’re only human and can only work so fast! The photos are good quality and I appreciate the details included with each listing. 

My ONLY tip for improvement would be for them to include item measurements for EVERY item, not just some of them. Guaranteed if the item doesn’t have measurements listed and I can’t find a reliable manufacturer sizing chart, I’m not going to take the gamble and make a purchase. Especially since they do charge a small but present re-stocking fee. Most items do have measurements listed, but I think every one of them should so I am confident in what I buy. 

Anyway this company has been an amazing experience for me! I love shopping second-hand clothes and there isn’t a thrift store near me, so this is a game changer! I log in almost every day just to see what else is new. The treasure hunt is so much fun and I’ve discovered several new favorite brands too!",5
7,"Love ThredUp!: I have been using ThredUp to buy and sell for a few years now. I absolutely love it for both.
As a buyer, I have gotten basically a brand new workout wardrobe for a fraction of the retail (Alo, Lululemon, and Nike leggings all for about 1/3 of retail in like new condition). I will also say that since the app has started, they are generally a lot more picky with condition than they used to be so if you had a bad experience due to quality in the past, I would give them another try. They do still make the occasional mistake on listed items due to their high volume. I ordered a pair of SPANX leggings that was a different pair than what was pictured. It was a final sale item, but they returned it easily for me. This is the only issue I have had with purchases. They also have become VERY picky with shoes and really only sell shoes that are like new. 
As a seller, it’s important to manage your expectations and be familiar with their payout structure before you send your items in. I have been using the Luxe program for the past year and am overall very happy with it. There are issues that arise, but CS deals with them fairly in my opinion. It may take a couple of days to get an answer, but that doesn’t bother me as long as there is a fair solution (which there usually is).
I have been overall really happy with ThredUp. I urge people to give them a try and be a sustainable shopper!",5
8,"Pretty good, all-in-all: I use thredUP a lot. I started using it in 2017 and it has definitely changed since then. There are more options and ways to filter your shopping now which is great, but some things annoy me. For instance, with the reward points, after spending so much money on this app, you can eventually “earn” $10 off. If you order over $79 worth of stuff you get free shipping. But if you want to use that $10 when you are ordering over $79, you are actually saving a measly $4 because they will tack that $6 shipping back on if the discount pulls you back under $79. So if you want to reward your customers for spending money with you and want them to keep coming back and using that discount, don’t rip them off of what they “earned.” If the amount before a coupon qualifies for free shipping, that shouldn’t be removed. The other thing that gets on my nerves is just how certain things are overpriced. Most of the time when I shop on this app I also have google pulled up to check actual retail prices. Saving $2 on something that has been worn isn’t really worth it if I could just go out and get a new one for almost the same cost. I get that they need to make a profit, but with how many people use this app I’m sure they still are. All-in-all, I do like thredUP. I don’t foresee me not using it anymore, I just hope they listen to their customers since I’ve seen a lot of reviews say the same things.",4
9,Order was wrong 😒: I ordered a purse from them witch is a no return policy on handbags witch is fine if you sent me the item I chose and paid for . Instead I got a hiking bag for a water bottle that I will NEVER ever use . I am extremely disappointed I have ordered from them quit a few times and have spent some money on this place ... and this is the second time I have received something that was wrong or the disciption was incorrect . I was beyond excited to receive this purse and once o open the box and seen what I had received it totally ruined everything.. and made me just not want to buy another item from them at all . I have three more orders from them that are on their way. But now I just wanna cancel everything & get my money back ! 😡 I use to love this website . But they have just ruined it for me . Now I can’t get in touch with nobody about my order . I can’t return it because it’s a no return policy . I almost feel scammed . 😕 they will not receive anymore of my hard working money. This is crazy and as a mother of 5 I don’t have much money to spend on myself and then the little money I do I don’t get what I ordered for myself . I’m just letting you know if you order from them Just know your taking that risk of getting something other then what you originally picked or paid for . Good luck !,5
10,"Great for if you’re in your twenties: I’ve been trying to build a larger wardrobe now that I’m in my twenties and ThredUp has been a great help! Like you can genuinely get an entirely new wardrobe for under 500$ and all of my items are brand names with tags or in like new condition. I definitely don’t recommend getting shoes or bags off of here though. My only issue is that often times they’ll describe items as in “Like new” condition but they’ll have scuffs on shoes or scratches on the hardware of purses. Still useable but definitely not “Like new”. I had that issue with a jacket recently too, that was all frayed and looked like something you pull out of a donation bin but it was described as “Like new”. I would definitely appreciate a more thorough evaluation of items, as well as if instead of listing items as the sizes marked on the clothing, you took actual measurements of it like mens clothing. There’s been a lot of times I buy things in size 4 and I receive them and they look more like a size 9 and I’ve had to just give them away. Actual measurements would be way more helpful. Overall it’s still extremely worth it and I’m not dissatisfied and will continue ordering off them. I still highly recommend this site but I do think they stand room for improvement. On a final note, I wish they carried mens clothes so I could buy clothes for my boyfriend too. I think you’re missing a huge demographic by not selling to them.",4
11,"Used to be so much fun!: I have been shopping with thredUP for several years. They have gone through many growing pains as any new company does. Unfortunately I have encountered several unacceptable issues over the last few months. The latest?  They simply cancelled an order that I placed for no reason. When I asked to speak with a manager so that I could understand what happened, I was told there wasn’t one available and that someone would email me. That never happened. Because of this order cancel, my bundle (which requires a certain amount for free shipping) was also messed up. The employees on the chat are sweet and really do try to be helpful however it doesn’t get anywhere. As some of you may know, thrifting is work!  Finding a style you like in your size and then getting it into your cart is not easy. So when you finally do “win” an item that you totally love, it’s a major disappointment for them to say “oops, order cancelled”. For this particular item, I  am embarrassed to admit that I refreshed my browser over and over for a period of about three hours to get it into my cart. I liked that top THAT much. Lol. And after my celebration, it was simply taken away. I have reached the point where I don’t think it’s worth my time to shop with them any longer and am slowly unwinding from my store credits. I would rather shop at other online retailers that care more about their clients. If you are thinking about starting a relationship with thredUP I would recommend elsewhere.",2
12,"No negative thoughts!: I have used thredUP for the past six months and have explored every facet of the website/app. The clean out bags are shipped directly to your house in an envelope and they hold a surprising amount of items. I have sent four bags of women’s clothing, maternity clothing, shoes, swimsuits, handbags, a little bit of everything. Each bag I’ve sent in has taken approximately three weeks to process once it arrived at their facility. The payout for the items accepted is reasonable and fair. I’ve used the store credit as well as discount codes to purchase items for my daughter (toddler) and myself. I’ve returned items (which is free) and received my refund in a timely manner each time. All of the items I’ve purchased have been in great condition and I’ve worn multiple times. I tell everyone looking for great deals to check out this app before stepping out to go shopping, because most items in this site look brand new and you only pay a fraction of the cost. The only thing this organization is missing is a men’s section. My fiancé is definitely jealous when my polka dot box comes in because he knows I spent much less than he typically would at another store and I receive more items for the money that I do spend. I am a firm believer in secondhand clothing after my experience with thredUP. I’ll definitely continue to be a loyal customer!",5
13,"Please fix these two things: I love thredUP so much, on any given day at least half of my outfit is from thredUP, if not all. The return process is super easy, I really enjoy the rewards system, and all the options to filter products makes it incredibly easy to find just what you’re looking for. However, there are a couple things I think can be improved upon. 1. I wish you would offer men’s clothes as well. I recommend thredUP to so many people, but you guys are missing out on a huge portion of people by not offering men’s clothing. & 2. If there’s a way to have multiple wishlists, I haven’t found it. I know it can be done because I have multiple saved searches, but all of the items that I actually favorite, are compiled into one giant list that’s hard to navigate.

Update: I am still waiting for both of these changes. Specifically the one that would allow multiple wishlists. When I save things, I like to be able to sort them into categories that way I’m actually able to tell how many of a certain type of item in interested in. If we can have multiple saved searches, there’s no reason as to why we don’t have the option to create multiple wishlists. It’s really overwhelming trying to navigate one big list as opposed to several smaller lists that are customized to your wants and needs. I know I’m not the only one that feels this way.",4
14,"Suggestions from a loyal customer.: I love ThredUP! For many reasons. First it is a way I can stop contributing to the real environmental problems fast fashion causes but also because I have always believed one persons trash is another persons treasure. I honestly would never be able to own some of the beautiful things I do because of the designer prices. You really do get what you pay for in clothing. Most big labels are big because their quality truly is better and the clothing is innovative. It lasts longer holds up better and feels nicer. My only suggestions are to send coupons to loyal customer into their email so it reminds us what a great place it is to shop. 20% off will get me to buy. Also why not let people who have spent a great deal of money with you hold that one or two items for a week until pay day. One last thing and it is my only complaint. The restocking fee of 2$ per item is just greedy. Having a return policy in necessary for online buying. The getting to try it on a home without being forced to keep it or loose money is a main reason I have shopped so long with this company. I would like to see the restocking fee negated at least on exchanges. Thanks ThredUP you have made me feel a little bit wealthier, a little bit prettier, sexier, more put together and most importantly luckier many times. I love you for it.",5
15,"Great Overall Experience!: I have been shopping on ThredUp's desktop website and the ThredUp app for over a year now. Shopping experiences on both platforms have been great. The process each time has been fun, easy, and seamless, and each item has arrived exactly as described. There has been a time or two I needed help from customer service (including a time where I made a mistake, not ThredUp) and customer service was very friendly and helpful both times, even helping me fix things after MY mistake...which they wouldn't have had to do. I would highly recommend shopping with ThredUp. Sometimes I see negative reviews online about selling to ThredUp based on low payout amount, however, I like that ThredUp is very transparent and gives you an estimate of what you'll receive based on brand name and condition. I would advise to check this before sending items in, and if you don't find it satisfactory, then don't sell to ThredUp. Keep in mind they do have costs associated with sending the clean out kit, assessing the items, listing the items, packaging/shipping the items, etc. Also, while you may not make a fortune, I like that the process is easy and you're able to keep these items out of landfills and de clutter. Overall, I've had a great experience with every aspect of ThredUp and would highly recommend them to a friend. Thanks, ThredUp!",5
16,"What happened to thredup!: I used to love this app, it WAS literally the best online thrifting app. It's went downhill from when I first started purchasing 6yrs ago, I would easily spend over $1000 in a year on amazing thrift finds! Which makes the new rewards program great for me because better perks to using the app! However, I spent over $1000 last year & didn't even recieve the right rewards tier! Contacting customer service is literally nonexistent, the chat is down & it's been almost a week now & I still haven't gotten a response through email! The estimated wait time through email is 8days to get your inquiry resolved...which is insane to me! I used to brag all the time about thredups customer service, but now its like they're under staffed. Then there's the issue with shipping, I've had so many issues FedEx, it's ridiculous! At this point I wish thredup would just switch to a new shipping provider, sometimes Fedex delivers or they send to usps & my shipment gets lost!! This is an ongoing issue that really needs to be looked at, I feel like a lot of the people who were really committed to thredup don't use the app as much anymore either. I really hope thredup improves the areas they are really failing because I'll have to stop purchasing from them if things don't improve.",5
17,"Mostly great: I’ve been a ThredUP user since 2016. It’s the first place I go for nearly every article of clothing I want, wear, or need. I also go there first for shoes and handbags. It’s best feature is huge inventory and second best is pricing. I can wear clothes I never would have bought retail, even on sale. I think my best purchase is a lovely Kate Spade satchel for nearly 75% off its retail price…I mean this thing is immaculate! I have also had my share of duds though. Items that are not in the condition as described, measurements that don’t match, even a pair of boots where the left was a different size than the right and the sole was detached. This latter item was described as having minor wear. OH, AND WHEN SHOPPING FOR BELTS, IT WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL TO KNOW THE WIDTH OF THE BELT! LIKE MAYBE PHOTOGRAPH THE BELT WITH A RULER?!? Now I know they are doing the best that can be done considering the volume of clothing items dealt with on a daily basis. But I think the process used to evaluate/grade/measure items could be a little tighter. I would to have the ability to review/grade/evaluate each order I receive. Something like an A+ to D- would do it for me. It’s been a while since I’ve sold anything - primarily because it takes several months for a clean out kit to process. So I’ve been selling on Poshmark or at a local consignment shop. I do like the ability to donate clean out kits to charity - that process is easy.",4
18,"lacks customer support and efficient service: the concept of the app is good but they really need to work on aspects of the website itself. first of all, communication. it's not so much about how long it takes to respond (usually 2-3 days, sometimes a week), but the responses from the team. i sent in an item that i wanted to sell and two people told me i would be paid out this day because someone purchased it. on the day of my supposed payout, i'm sitting here confused because the item is still up for sale but i haven't gotten my payout. two days later someone finally tells me that it was cancelled and put up for sale again, but only after i contacted them. why didn't i get any notification if the item was cancelled? why don't i get any notification at all regarding the item? not to mention that your customer service team seriously needs to be worked on. i talked to somebody about my experience and they didn't offer any consolation at all. just straight to the point ""your item got cancelled."" i don't mind that it's cancelled, i just wish there was  empathic communication regarding that. Karly didn't even say anything like ""Hey! We're sorry for the confusion and we understand how you feel. This and that happened blah blah."" That is such trash customer service. If it was any other item I wouldn't have been so upset, but i did send in a $1,000 bag so excuse me if i feel like a little decent customer service is warranted.",3
19,"Seller’s Beware: This app is a great place to shop but it has gotten really shady for sellers.  I have consigned for a number of years and lately their payment practices have become really shady.  For example, They will tell you your item will sell for say $500 and you’ll get close to 80% of that.  But, then if it’s sold as a sale item the sale price may be half of that, say $250 and somehow you end up with far less than 80%, probably closer to 20%.  I’m a CPA so I get numbers and I’ve emailed customer service repeatedly to get clarification on the pricing formulas.  A class action suit or some sort of investigation seems imminent given their lack of transparency and unwillingness to explain.  Perhaps there are cash flow issues.  This is their latest response:

Thank you for cleaning out with us. I am sorry to hear this cleanout did not live UP to your expectations.

It’s important to remember that using our Clean Out service means that you may not earn as much as you would if you sold your items peer to peer. But what you may miss in earnings, you earn back in overall convenience. Our goal is to help make our customers’ lives easier by helping them get rid of unwanted items from their closets from the convenience of their own home. While you might be able to earn slightly more by selling elsewhere, thredUP does all of the hard work for you: no driving, no negotiating with buyers, no dealing with rejected items.",2
20,"Great marketplace for quality secondhand items: I’ve been using thred up fo over a year now, and I would definitely rate it at 5 stars. I use the app mostly for business casual and exercise clothing, and I’ve had no complaints about the quality of the items I’ve received. I usually stick to items listed as “like new,” and they really do come looking like new. There was even one situation where I had ordered and paid for an item listed as like new, but it turns out there was a small hole that their initial inspection had missed. Well they caught this mistake before the item made it to me, refunded me my payment, and I still received the item as a “flawed freebie”. I didn’t have to do a thing! This kind of quality control puts my mind at ease when shopping with this company. As for selling, they are clear not to expect much for your items. I sent in a bag of items I was going to donate anyway, with low expectations, and received a modest amount for them that I was satisfied with. If you want to receive top dollar for your used items, then you can go to the trouble of setting up an eBay store, creating listings, and shipping to buyers yourself. As for me, I was happy to let thred up do the work for me for a small payout. Overall, I would definitely recommend thred up.",5
21,"Tons of Room for Improvement: I have purchased from the app a handful of times for various items. One common theme is that the measurements are always off. If it looks like it’ll fit or the measurements look compatible with your body, odds are if you’re petite (as i am) it’ll come to your door and be bigger or bulkier than you bargained for. They will often pin the skirts or dresses to look like they fit the mannequin which they don’t disclose in the description of the item, so i’ve gotten them and they’ve been too big cuz i’ll discover they’ve had to have been pinned to fit that mannequin. Its misleading when you first start shopping on there.  Instead of paying $7+ to have it returned, i know someone who alters them for me. It is expensive to do it often, though. This is a problem with dresses and skirts. I have a coat that I wear often and love it. There’s just a huge size distortion and it needs to be disclosed the mannequins size, if the garment was pinned for the photo, and more accurate measurements need to be taken. I will only purchase from brands that i know fit me from now on, if at all. It’s just so frustrating to come to a deficit of approximately $16 for every returned purchase ($5.99 shipping to and from if returned, $1.99 restock fee, and give or take $3 in taxes). Store credit enables you to have free shipping for the return but it’s a loss if you aren’t on often. Purchase with caution is the lesson here.",3
22,"Used to love- Extremely poor service changed mind: I ordered over $250 of items at the end of April. They shipped in multiple boxes, and the largest item never arrived. I reached out to the company, and specifically asked that if the package turns up back at the warehouse, could it be resent so I didn’t lose out on the items. A few days later, I received an email stating that the package was back at the warehouse, I had been issued a refund (that I never asked for) for all the items, and that they’d be reposted with new links within 48 hours and I’d have to repurchase all of the items. I was told that the package was at the warehouse. I was also told via email that I should contact ThredUP via chat. The chat rep said the package was NOT at the warehouse and was still en route to be delivered to me. This was a full week past the 10 day delivery mark, coming from a warehouse that is only a 2 hour drive from my delivery address. ThredUP assured me that I would be emailed with links for all of the items again so I could repurchase everything. It’s been over a month and they’ve been silent. There is no excuse for the lack of communication, it seems like no one has any idea of what the processes are or where these items ended up. It’s deeply damaged my trust in the company and I’m hesitant to use them again. I don’t want to get excited over ordering a bunch of clothes that will never arrive and then be lied to and blown off by the company.",2
23,"I’m not a shopper, ThredUP changed that: A little over a year ago my washing machine destroyed about 80-90% of my cloths. I was also unemployed, so no clothing budget. Not too long after I found myself with a new job (yeah!) but the first week was a struggle of mixing and matching cloths to get through. So I went shopping, I probably went to malls, outlets, shopping centers, even looked online in the traditional places. It took several days and in the end, I ended up with only 2 blouses that I didn’t even really like but would work both $50 each. $100 had only got me 2 things and I didn’t even like them that much! And I had so much to replace! Then someone at my new place of work mentioned ThredUP. I had never heard of it but she swore by it. So I checked it out. It was a life changer. I loved the sustainability of it, I loved the options for it, I loved the prices, the styles, I love everything about it! I had shopped at consignment stores before but they rarely had my sizes and it is really hit and miss depending on where you go. Here it’s all at my fingertips - which can be dangerous for my budget. In a few months time I have been able to replenish my closet, get rid of the “will do for now” cloths all with little frustration. Thank you thredUP, your existence is very much appreciated!",5
24,"Customer Service: Customer Service appears to be non-existent. There was a problem with shipping of two items I paid for. I have successfully purchased many items from Thredup over the past three or four years. My shipping address for this specific order was not only correct, but Thredup has shipped to this address many, many times in the past. I attempted to contact Thredup to try to salvage my order by writing (messaging) Customer Service twice. No response from Customer Service. In desperation, I searched for a telephone number for Customer Service and couldn’t find one. The result is the two items that I needed were returned to Thredup: one, a cream colored silk jacket (size 4p) apparently was purchased by another customer as it no longer appears on the site. I was able to reorder and pay for the second item: a brown coat. Currently, I am waiting for it to ship, although I received a notification that Thredup was waiting to ship, due to a “bundle?” issue. Dear Thredup, I have been very happy to shop for family members on your site. Thus us my first complaint. Please strengthen your customer service so that your customers can continue being happy, not frustrated, shoppers. Thank you, sincerely. Donna, A loyal Customer",5
25,"The only way to shop!: I have been shopping on ThredUp for 9 years and now my wardrobe is 95% from their warehouses. I started buying stuff for my kids too. Since I bought so much from their website, I have gotten a handful items that were not as described, but the situation was quickly solved when I chatted with customer service, which is very convenient on the browser and I have always been satisfied with how they solved the mistake. I always take advantage of the rewards I get, the sales… this is my go-to website to find special occasion dresses and outfits. I love that no one will wear the same thing I will wear. People ask me all the time where I found my clothes and I always get compliments on my outfits. I am super happy and I a, never going back to buying new.
Note: Now when you bundle your purchases it takes a little longer to arrive after you close the bundle, so plan ahead if you have a special event. The only thing I don’t like from the app is that I can’t pinch the screen to make the words bigger. I usually check it out at night, when I’m in bed and NOT wearing my glasses. Other than that, it is a great experience, you help the environment and look great in the process.
I seriously love this company.",5
26,"Never Again ✌🏼.: I was a serious supporter for years and used to love sending my clothes in for up cycling/selling. However, over time I noticed it got worse and worse with payouts and items conveniently going “missing” from the kits I had sent in. I had more and more items that I sent in that were never posted or returned to me (even though I know I sent them in and have always paid the extra fees for any items of mine that didn’t sell to be returned to me). The straw that broke the camels back for me with this company was back when they still accepted jewelry and accessories. I sent in a brand new ring I never had worn (in the original box with the tags still attached to the ring) and when my unsold items from the kit I mailed it in with were returned to me, the ring box came with someone else’s used, tarnished, and bent up clearly well loved ring in my rings box! DISGUSTING! It’s so shady and petty. From what I would guess, the staff member that had sorted my items when my kit arrived must have took my ring and put one they were wearing at that time in the box in it’s place and sent it with the rest of my kit back to me thinking I wouldn’t notice. GROSS and absolutely shameful. If I have to video record what I send in a kit just to prove what is stolen from me, it’s clearly a company I shouldn’t be trusting to sell my items. I’ll stick to Mercari from now on, they are expensive, but at least no one can steal from me, while also making money off of my items.",1
27,"LOVE it! My go-to wardrobe builder: I absolutely love ThredUP and the app. The app’s filter options make it super easy to find what you’re looking for in sizes you need. An almost endless inventory at your convenience in a mobile app means you can browse away time otherwise spent in waiting situations or have more fun in your down time. Fair return policies give you buying confidence and the buy and bundle feature is a game changer, letting you take a week to keep adding to an existing order to reach free shipping status. 
There are a few things I wish we could see differently in the app and management of listings. When you have a ton of search results, I wish there were a way to skip to page 50 for instance. The way it is now you either go thru to the end or you have to start over next session. I also wish posting info were more descriptive. There are times I zoom in and in and in trying to see if something is corduroy or velour or if that’s a side zipper. More photos and just a little more description would be incredibly helpful and probably cut down on returns. With all this said, since I started shopping ThredUP several years ago, my wardrobe has improved greatly and at least 75% (prob more!) comes from here!",5
28,"Absolutely the MOST amazing site ever!!!: I few items of theirs and a really cute top from Old Navy. I used to buy some Eileen Fisher though it’s a little out of my price range at the moment but there are really good deals on her stuff. Basically any brand/designer you could wish for and it’s all so user friendly. Colour, size, item, style. Amazing! I also love the fact that it reduces my “footprint”. Last but certainly not least is the absolutely fun, delightful and professional way it arrives. I was so wonderfully surprised at the packaging! I’m not going to spoil it for those that haven’t purchased anything yet! My only regret is that they don’t have this in South Africa! When I was immigrating to the States I had mountains of clothes and shoes that I had to get rid of. It was so time consuming and tedious trying to catalogue them individually and try upload them to sites. Even taking pictures that showed the garments was difficult! The clothes were such good quality that I didn’t want to just give them to Goodwill and I had already donated a lot of clothes. The thought of being able to box them up, send them off, and get some money without any of the hassle would have been a blessing! Well done and thank you SO much!!",5
29,"First time buyer...: First let me start off by saying I'm absolutely happy with the clothes I received! And I also got my order several days early which I was so excited about. I got it yesterday morning and the expected arrival date was oct30-Nov2, so that was a big plus! I was so scared that what I ordered was not going to fit me and I didn't exactly know how each of them would look. I did make sure I chose each one that showed the measurements for the chest and length and I chose gently used and like new. I bought all Victoria pink shirts. And every single one them were my right size! So I was so happy that I got measurements correct. There was one shirt that came in with a stain on the front neckline and it was not mentioned in the description. I was really upset about this because I really loved and was excited  about this sweater and plus it was a nonreturnable item but I spoke with a agent and she gave me a refund,  Which was super cool!  Anyways I just wanted to share my experience of shopping with thredUP! I highly recommend, I seriously just got my order in, and since I now know that I was correct with my sizing and that the clothes are nice I'm ready to go through my hearted items and shop again!",5
30,"Great for buyers BUT can improve seller experience: Love the concept, vision and marketing (easy to navigate app, pretty straight forward and as a buyer there are pretty good deals and the packaging is very nice, aside from great shipping prices). The team is great at getting back quickly if there are questions but they can play do so much. 

BUT, as a SELLER now I use Mercari to increase my chances of selling (and to make more selling). ThredUP says that on average 40% of sent in items sell but this hasn’t been my case with the 4 clean outs sent in (or you get cents for a sell, I got $0.36 for a Hannah Anderson tshirt ). It would be awesome to have more clarity on what happens with items that aren’t selected to be sold (items that are new, desired brands and that ThredUP doesn’t show available on their site), especially if we send in items following the guidelines of what to send ThredUP. Who keeps these item, are they sold on other platforms, donated in the US or other countries, do employees keep these new items? It would be great for the “return my items if they aren’t selected/ sold” option to be available after ThredUP reviews the clean out box. I know I would use ThredUP again if this becomes available. 

Hope this is helpful, I can imagine how hard it must be to keep everyone happy and thanks for taking care of the planet ThredUP!",3
31,"I almost exclusively shop here now: I’ve been shopping at ThredUp for about 5 years now and the only complaint I have with how things have changed over time is the return policies. I totally understand that shipping items back and forth doesn’t help our carbon footprint, but it now puts the responsibility on the buyer to rehome items they don’t want, or to choose to take a loss. I have a stack of perfectly good clothes that I now need to try to sell somewhere else or donate, which is an additional step I didn’t have before. If the measurements on items were more accurate, I would have half as many items to rehome, so there’s also that. And it can take a LONG time for them to send you a donation bag and then to process it. However, I still recommend ThredUp to everyone I know who buys women’s or kids clothing (including a description of the above caveats), but my husband wishes they’d sell men’s clothes. I still constantly get compliments on my clothes and nothing beats the warm feeling of knowing you saved a TON of money while also helping reduce fashion waste! I say that I “almost exclusively shop here” only because there are still a few things (mostly shoes) that I buy new.",5
32,"ThredUP is NOT what it once was.: I have been shopping with thredUP for YEARS, initially absolutely loved it. I could thrift conveniently through an app? I’ve been all for it! The prices were reasonable (on most items) & they always have what I’m looking for. BUT recently so much has changed, it’s seems like they just don’t value their customers anymore, and don’t make the effort to make sure things are accurately listed & FAIRLY listed.. I know my prices, I know what things go for.. so when I see something like a lularoe top (used) saying it’s retail it twice of what it actually is, then the item selling for more than what it goes brand new at retail? That’s unacceptable. Who is running behind the scenes? & more so, how is this being allowed to happen with so many items? I’m seeing this way too often, those who aren’t as aware are being totally ripped off! ThredUP is suppose to be a place to “save” & get a good deal. I was a victim of this with my past couple of orders, the last completely putting me off to ever buying again.. I paid for a “new with tags” top, only to get it & see there was a GOODWILL tag on it, it was USED & I paid double of what the tagged price even was. How horrifying is that? Ugh. It’s been real thredUP, but no more. You guys are not being fair nor caring for your long time customer as you should be! Oh, and customer service now takes forever to respond! You’ll get a bot instead, and be told someone will contact you back by email.. eventually, if ever.",1
33,"How I shop now: 90% of clothes that I buy are from this app now. It’s SO EASY to search for the clothes that u want via color, size, textile, type, brand, etc. The amount that I save in money is INCREDIBLE. I have much better quality clothes now for a fraction of the price. I love that these clothes are getting another chance and I feel that’s good sustainable practice as a consumer. I love the experience as I browse for clothes in this app. Very good and stable too. 

Several gripes: size selections are not for top or bottom separately. Come on! You know that we’re not all the same on top and bottom!! Another thing is when I scroll to the bottom of an item description, I see other items from the same seller. This could be changed to items that are “like” the item I’m looking at. You could get AI to understand what a similar item means (same brand, style, look, etc.).  Another point is for dresses/tops, the sleeves should be added as a filter: long, 3/4, sleeveless, spaghetti strap, halter, strapless, etc. u have neck silhouettes but not sleeve length? I’m typically doing seasonal shopping and having a mix of sleeve lengths is annoying.

Love the app and look forward to it becoming even better!!",5
34,"Worst Customer Service Department EVER!!!: I, along with numerous other thread-up customers will be filing complaints with the BBB regarding the endless list of complaints There are endless complaints about missing items, unresponsive customer service, ridiculous payouts and above all, theft.  I suggest reading all reviews but would be willing to bet that 90% of the positive reviews were submitted by the company or they paid folks to write them.  Anyone I speak to that has tried to sell with thread up has nothing positive to say about their selling experience.  

I sent the pre labeled bags to sell my items and four of them arrived and were processing however, one of the seems to have disappeared into thin air.  Today was my fourth email sent in the past 3 weeks because the three previous emails have not gotten a response.  It seems email and chat ( pre-programmed answers) are your only chance of talking to anyone.  Thread-up does not want to speak to their customers directly because there is no number posted anywhere on their site and they simply refuse to respond to emails.  I am beyond frustrated to the point I will not continue doing business with them once these bags “expire”.  A company that does not make communication available for those who keep their business afloat or care to promptly respond to issues or concerns, is not a company I care to support or allow them to profit from me any longer.",1
35,"Stick with it and you’ll come to LOVE it!: I have been using Thredup now for about 6 months and have purchased about 15 pieces. It is a new way of shopping that took some getting used to for me. I am short and curvy so it’s not always obvious what size I should order. At first, I thought thredup wasn’t for me after I placed a few orders and nothing worked (returns are easy!). I decided to stick with it because the prices are great and I truly believe in second hand as a step to a more sustainable world. After a few tries I started getting a better idea of what sizes and styles work best for me. Now, I love it!! I buy pretty much all my clothes from Thredup now. Not only is the second hand aspect great but it’s also an amazing e-commerce experience. I love that I can buy any style or brand of clothes through one app and get rewards and free shipping. Nice work!! Now - please add men’s clothes because my husband wants in! :)

I wish there was an annual subscription fee to avoid all the fees (restocking, consignment fee, shipping). I think in the long run the fees are worth it because you save so much on high quality clothes but it does feel a bit like you are being nickel and dimed. I’d love the option to pay a flat price once a year and be done with it.",4
36,"Absolutely hate this app and this company: This company basically ripped me off. I sent my items, paid the $11-12 for the send back bag for the items they weren’t going to sell, waited for my items to sell, claimed the ones that didn’t sell to be sent back to me (you also have to pay for an additional send back bag, another $12!)... AND THEY WERE NEVER SENT BACK TO ME. I basically just gave them free items! I contacted customer support and they did not help me at all. “Can’t find your items.. so that’s it, oh well” was the summary of the response I got. I sell on multiple selling apps and because of the inefficient way they do things and lack of competent customer service, I lost money from being able to sell it on other apps. I STILL want my items back and I will continue to tell all people I know (including on posting on social media pages) what a scam of a company this is and how unhelpful the employees are.

UPDATE: Still absolutely HATE this app and this company. Someone reached out to me to help resolve the issue and did absolutely nothing to help. I still am upset because I literally just have them practically new items, FOR FREE. I even asked the customer support to cancel my account for me and the lease she could do was save me the trouble from all the trouble I’ve already had, but she just sent me a link and made me do it myself. Complete joke of customer support. I am letting every single person I know how awful this company is for ripping me off.",1
37,"Lots of Potential but Limited Audience: I like the concept of thredUP a lot, and the UX/UI is seamless. Great customer support, great aesthetics-- all that is there. But the actual selection of clothing they have to offer is..... not really geared toward a demographic that is most likely to be really into thrifting. And that's millennials. I don't know how to put this nicely, but 90% of the clothes look fresh out of the wardrobe of a white suburban mom. There's nothing wrong with that style, but the young generation is more eco-conscious than ever, and these clothes are not what we're looking for! We can honestly be your best consumers if you just gave us trendier, bolder, more recent styles. Everything here looks like it's been sitting in your warehouses since you bought them from a mother back in the mid 2000s. 

I love the app so much though and have found some good pieces. I whole heartedly believe in thrifting and the good it can do for our economy and environment. So please, recognize our consumer potential. Hire some more young people to help you decide what kinds of clothes to buy from people who send in boxes for a clean-out. I'm desperate for more options. Millennials have the potential to be your greatest customer-- we're more likely to buy secondhand than older generations are! Just give us something that actually suits our age range, and I promise you we will swoop it up",3
38,"Nothing but positive: I have nothing but positive things to say about ThreadUp and their app. I have purchased and sold on this app and each time it has been a positive experience. ThreadUp has a very conscientious business model and is committed to helping reduce the massive amounts of clothing from ending up in our landfills. If you think you are going to make a ton of money selling your clothing here think again. Go somewhere else if you are looking to profit big. You need to remember that ThreadUp is doing almost all of he work to sell your clothing including taking photos, listing your items and paying for shipping for you to send your items in. All of this takes a substantial amount of time and resources. Shopping on ThreadUp is super fun and their packages will make you feel special. I encourage anyone purchasing ThreadUp to double check the photos and the sizes. If it looks really small but the size is listed as a lot larger then chances are the size was listed incorrectly. Use common sense. And lastly, their Goody Boxes are a great way to shop. Chances are you will keep something from your goody box which will offset the cost of the goody box. Thank you ThreadUp for making the world and our closets a more beautiful place. xoxo",5
39,"Very slow processing: As someone who’s been through both the buyer and seller scenario a few times, I think the buyer side of the equation may be “average” at best, but the seller side is not worth the effort. They are slow to process your submitted items, award you pennies when an item sells, take your items out of circulation while someone who’s taken them “on consignment” mulls them over for a couple of weeks then returns them when they’re out of season and no longer of interest to the general population. It’s really just not worth the effort to get the items to the post office, wait 3+ weeks for the items to be processed, see your items misrepresented (I.e., blue stripes are described as black/gray) and over-priced (I would t even pay that much for my own used clothes no matter how good of a condition), then maybe get $3 credit for a nice item. On the buyer’s side, we can only go by the description and photo. Most of the phots are sub-par and the descriptions aren’t accurate or consistent. Measurements of bust, length and waist should be available for every item...really no excuse not to provide this. The type of fabric or at least a “we think this is ponte knit” would be extremely helpful so a potential buyer knows if there is “give” or not. When you can’t touch the item, the photo on a lifeless mannequin doesn’t do it justice and there are no measurements provided, then I think I’d prefer to shop local consignment. Really need to up their game.",1
40,"Thrifty Fun!: I really enjoy all of the items available and prices are set to move the items, which basically means if you love an item, buy because it may not be there the next time you look. I like the ability to narrow what I’m looking for through filters and I like that my sizes are automatically filtered. I would suggest that different sizes or measurements be used for tops and bottoms as a large for one may not need a large for the other. Also, when an item shows “sold” there is an option to shop similar items, which is a great idea, however, most of the items that can me up are not in my size. For example, similar boots in a size 10 will not work for my size 7 foot, so it doesn’t serve much purpose. 

Cloths and shoes are mostly in great condition. I did encounter two moments one where the zipper on a skirt was broken (I may not have purchased the skirt had this been noted) and another where a pair of boots came smelling so bad of cigarette smoke that I had to leave them on the front porch for a week and then Fabreeze them to rid them of the smell. Minor incidents but worth mentioning. 

I still enjoy shopping on the app and I will continue to buy good quality second hand clothing!",5
41,"Stop shipping via Fedex: I have been a customer since 2016. I love your app. I love the way it’s laid out, the prices, and the variety you offer. I love your customer service associates, who are personable, fast, and efficient. I HATE the fact that you ship via FedEx. Fedex is a garbage company. I used to get my packages within a week. Now it’s taking half a month, they never update tracking, and they treat my packages like a piece of crap. Throwing them in the snow filled ditch, where I can’t even see them from my house. I contacted you, and was told I would have my account tagged to use other shipping methods whenever possible. Which was great… Apparently it wasn’t possible, because here I sit again, 10 days after I placed my order- the package hasn’t even left FedEx facility. Rest assured you would have my whole hearted 5 stars if your shipping wasn’t so atrocious. Just wanted to give you a heads up. 

April 2022: Update: it seems they (FedEx) lost one of my packages. I’m a VIT. I want to spend my money with you. But I’m about done here.

Is there a way to change which warehouse my items ship from? The Suwannee, GA one isn’t working out for me. If you have a warehouse that is using usps I would like my items to go out of that one. There has to be some way to resolve this. I know I’m not the only one with this problem, because I’ve scanned your reviews.",2
42,"Ok for buying but NOT for selling.: Started selling on the app at the beginning of the year and thought it was great! Customer support was only a chat away and they would honor what they would say. With the new recent changes in payout and pricing adjustments they want you to basically give your stuff away, even high end items. I understand they list, photograph and store our inventory but they take a huge chunk of every sale as it is. They make tons of money off of sellers and don’t really care about them in my opinion. There has been a huge influx of damaged reclaimed items as well, I've gotten items back stained, ripped and without the new tags! Trying to get them to compensate you for your damaged items is also a hassle, they can take up to 3-4 weeks to reply to an email and will have you going back and forth with them for a fair solution. They damaged one of my most expensive pieces, a $1,000 dress and told me it wasn’t bad and it could be fixed by going to the cleaners! What kind of company ruins your items and tells you to go out to get it fixed during a pandemic without a fair payout? Their customer service reps have also become very condescending and rude. One rep will tell you one thing and another will tell you something different. They are so confusing. I never thought my feelings about the platform would change so quickly but it’s just not great anymore.",1
43,"Way more fun than going to the mall: I buy secondhand clothing whenever possible. “Thanks! It’s secondhand!” has become my default response anytime someone compliments my outfit. Being able to filter by condition (and having four options for condition instead of just “like new” or “used”) makes it much easier to find the right piece. 
There are a few features that would be really nice to have:
1. The ability to filter out materials. If I’m looking for a sweater and select “wool,” a lot of the search results are acrylic sweaters with a tiny bit of wool. 
2. I can never remember brand names on the spot, but if I see the name/logo, I know if I like the brand. A “show all brands” option under the brand filter would be great. It’d be really handy if we could specify a list of preferred brands and search against that list (similar to how we can specify a list of sizes under My Sizes).
3. If I’m looking at an item on the website, there’s a section at the bottom that suggests similar brands. I’ve been able to find a lot of new brands through this feature, and it’d be great to see this functionality integrated into the app.",5
44,"Do not consign with them!!!: I ordered a luxe kit with Thred Up and sent them about 10 items, half luxe. All new with tags. Some very expensive items.  It took about 3-4 weeks to get them on their site, which is fine. Anyway, selling anything under $100 isn’t worth it because they take so much commission. My biggest problem with them is they allow returns. Out of the 5 items that sold, 4 were returned. And I have no idea what condition my items are now in after they were in the possession of a buyer and shipped two extra times. I feel that if they are not buying items outright, they should not allow returns. Also, they lost one item. I decided to ask for my items back, including the ones that were relisted after being returned, they have not yet been returned to me and I have to pay to have them returned. I hope they aren’t damaged when I get them. Overall, it might be okay to buy from them, but don’t sell to them. 

Update: I finally had my items that didn’t sell or were returned to Thred Up returned to me and one of them was returned to me damaged and dirty. It was a $445 NWT Dress and now it’s unsellable. I emailed customer service two weeks ago and they will not email me back, so apparently they don’t care that they ruined my item.  Also, because I had to pay to have items that were sold and returned sent back to me, I actually lost money consigning with them. Don’t trust this company, they are terrible!!!",1
45,"Overpriced: I used to LOVE ThredUP. As a person who is trying to reduce my footprint, but finds thrift store shopping to be too disorganized and overwhelming, it was great to have an option that made searching for that perfect secondhand clothing item not only easy, but also incredibly convenient. Yes, you paid more than at a normal thrift store (and even some consignment shops), but having the heavy lifting taken care of was worth it- and I was still paying significantly less than retail price. (I think original listing is typically 20% or more off of estimated retail.)Lately, however, when I go on the app to check for clothes, the prices are insane and marked up WAY too high. The estimated retail prices are really inflated (A single Carter’s onesie listed for the price of a 3-pack, a Zara top for girls priced higher than anything currently on their website, etc.) and as a result, the “discounted” thrift store price ends up being roughly the same as (if not more than) what I would pay for a brand new item from the retailer. On top of that, the style is never from the current season or is used. All of this make it so that the only advantage to shopping this site is for the environmental impact. While that is certainly a good incentive to shop secondhand, I don’t think I can justify spending the same (or more) amount of money on a secondhand wardrobe that I would spend if I purchased new.",2
46,"I do not understand…..: I normally don’t write reviews but the more I think about it the more I think I should. This is the place for used goods gently or well used. I bought a few things from here mostly work pants. I’m very grateful for that a lot of times it’s hard to find black dress, work pants. Unfortunately, I have started to notice though that the price for these items on here are not at a discounted price a lot of the time. When they have a sale or something like that it’s a bit better but for what I can buy brand new on sale from the actual store versus the prices that are on here it just makes more sense. The shipping cost is outrageous. A lot of times there are things that I want to buy but the price of the things that’ll end up paying is always more than what I think. I know this is about reducing waste and using things that have only been worn 10 or so times but most people want to have brand new things and come to places like this for things that they want but are expensive at the stores. The prices, though are basically the same as the stores.  I know some of these are name brands and that they should charge more for them ….but when you’re talking about American Eagle jeans that are the same price as when you get them from American eagle… I just think that is a bit messed up.",2
47,"Wanted to love it but couldn’t: This app and the idea of thredUP itself is so awesome— a place to buy quality & designer clothes that is gentle on the planet & your wallet. But there are several execution issues that make the experience disappointing. 
First, the good: excellent selection of items and brands. It’s really fun to browse and explore. The app carries many of my favorite brands and it’s intuitive and easy to use. The prices are low. Items arrive in cute polka dot packaging. All but one item I’ve received met it exceeded my expectations for quality. 
The not-so-good: hard to tell fit & few item specifics provided. ThredUP doesn’t provide much of the information that you’d typically find on a clothing label, so it’s hard to search for your favorite styles from brands you love. For example, if you’re looking for jeans, you’d find “Levi’s” but not “Levi’s 501.” There are also not many photos per item to help with this. Since each item is one of a kind, there are no customer reviews to tell you how something fits, etc. All this made for a lot of returns, which was a bit of a PITA, because items are shipped from various warehouses and arrive sometimes weeks apart. When thredUP recently started charging a return restocking fee for each item, I decided the inconvenience and hidden charges outweighed the benefits.",3
48,"Never Again: Ok so I decided to try ThredUP, I have been using other selling apps and was doing just fine but I wanted to give them a try. I requested a bag which it was nice that I didn’t had to pay shipping for sending my items. I sent my items which included 5 brand new items only one didn’t had a tag and the rest of the clothes were used but still in good condition. It took a month! from the time I sent my items to them processing my items it took a whole month. Now once they processed my items I was very upset to see that for 4 of the brand new items they only gave me $2.00!!! Are you kidding me? They are selling these four items for $40 total on their site but I only received 5% of that? And all the other items were placed on consignment and for each item that sell I’m only getting between $0.35 to $1! Not to mention that one of the brand new items I sent with tags was not even listed along with other used items that were also not listed I wish they would tell me what happened to those items if they are donated would like to know where is it going to but have a feeling they are just profiting from donated items from their customers. Anyways lesson learned I’m never selling to ThredUP again nor even buy from them. Just save your time you can make more money by selling your items on websites like Mercari in which you keep 90% of your sales and Poshmark you keep 80%.",1
49,"Faulty app: I’ve noticed a few things that really need developer oversight. I am a very long time and regular customer. 1. Saved items no longer appear in available favorites. I also cannot delet saved items I WANT to delete: I’ve tried to remove by unselecting the heart icon. It does nothing so two months of try to save items as favorites have done nothing. If they drop from my cart they are very hard to locate. 2. Please consider an “add to waitlist” feature for items that are sold. The RealReal has this for items that end up being returned 3. If you use the app to try to purchase an item for bid, it has a major time delay. I have compared it with my desktop computer and lost a few items in the remaining seconds because it’s not an accurate time portrayal 4. Not all items that are listed went through being open for bids. Why is this? I like the early bid option since items are literally listed all day long and SOME of can’t monitor listings all day. I miss out on so many items that are listed at 3 am. Please stop this. Can’t you just do like 2 or 3 drops per day like the RealReal? Listing on the hour for hours at a time has become tedious so I stopped monitoring or caring. 5. Yes, your customer service has become embarrassing. You’ve clearly expanded beyond your capacity to assist people and a bot device with a one week wait time is unacceptable. Who is running the show over there?",1
50,"Very poor help: So I bought about $200 in clothing from thredUP I sat outside because I know I live in a bad area and my items never came the items said delivered but I never got them. So I went to them on their app on their poorly executed chat help and I got maybe a couple messages a day telling me that your packages were delivered here is the tracking and I explained them I understand that but I never got my items they gave me a run around for about a week and when I finally had to go through Paypal to get any sort of response they banned by account. Super scammy

And I have contacted thredUP they gave me the runaround for over a week they did not actually try to help me they just kept saying over and over again that the items were marked delivered you guys refused to help me you guys I asked for was store credit equal to the amount that I didn’t get because I never received my items and I can’t tell you guys that and you kept saying that yes you did it was delivered and then you guys be in my account when I went to Paypal because you guys were in helping me and it had been dried out for over a week and then you been my account for it after I bought items Do your payment plan option that held onto my money and you guys didn’t send me anything and you told me my account was banned because I went through PayPal because you guys were in helping me you guys are scamy you scam people .",1
51,"Filter doesn’t reset: When I am trying to find clothes in my daughter’s size, instead of mine, the filter won’t show other sizes. I wear a large, but she’s a small or xs. The app doesn’t show any size that isn’t mine, even when I uncheck all the stuff that links to my size. I’ve told them this three times, but they still haven’t fixed. I guess they don’t want me buying for more than me? Update: I reset all of “my sizes” to my daughters sizes. Had to reload a few times, but it finally worked. All that being said, it shouldn’t be this hard. 
Second update: I figured it out! They keep directing me to an invisible “plus size” filter that’s hard to get rid of because it’s automatic and not deselectable in the filter menu.
Also don’t bother selling stuff with them unless you buy very high end (read expensive) stuff. I gave them stuff with the tags still on and I still haven’t made enough to cover the shipping charge. Also, they mislabel things. I have some blouses that I used to wear to work (I wear scrubs now) that I shipped to them. They labeled them “athletic wear”, so a month later they still haven’t sold. It’s a waste of time and money. I’d rather donate to my local church.",4
52,"Fantastic store: I just completed a style program to help me identify my best colors, neutrals, garment lines and fit, etc.  My closet was full of the wrong things that made me look older than I am, heavier than I am, and frumpy.  Guess how I replaced these items with clothing that makes me look and feel great?  Thred Up!  I spent less than $15 for most pieces and even found fabulous outerwear for $20-35.  Wonderful.  I love that I kept within my budget, filled my wardrobe with things I love to wear, and had a way to send my barely worn but wrong for me items to a place where they can be found by someone for whom they do suit (cleanout kit).  I’m a mother of 6 in my early 40s ... There are thousands of styles on Thred Up to suit any age, body type, and coloring.  The search features make it quick and easy to find what you are looking for, solving the “nothing suits me in this store” and “buying things that just aren’t as good as they could be just to buy something” shopping dilemmas.  If I can’t find it today, I save the search and check alerts of new items in that category.  Amazing!  I’m so grateful for this store.  Plus, the discounts, points, etc. are generous, too.",5
53,"Needs Improvement: I like ThredUp, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I feel like the descriptions of items should be more in-depth as I have received boots and a sweater in worse condition than described. The webpage and search features are awful when it comes to looking for a certain item. I feel like I’ll have to dig around and scroll for hours to find something specific. I have also waited almost a month or more to receive items. I don’t know how they can operate as a business that way, especially when it states the shipping to be much faster. Also one time they sent me the wrong size. I sent back the item and was given an 8 dollar credit. They didn’t even give the option to make it right. So with the 8 dollar credit I actually lost money because shipping was 5.99. I should have been given free shipping to make up for their mistake, so I didn’t loose money. I want to like this app so much, and I have found some great deals. But most of the time, I find all the negative things to really outweigh the good. I am thankful for the site as I have been able to update my closet, but even some of the prices for used stuff on here is awful too. I will still be using this site, but with caution. Sometimes saving a few dollars isn’t even worth it.",3
54,"Extremely affordable and perfect: For the most part, I like ThredUP and I think it’s by far the best way for me to get clothing cheap while it’s great quality. There’s just a few things that could easily be improved upon... 1. The measurements aren’t accurate... I’m not sure how they think they’re measuring correctly... but it’s far off and very iffy... I find it’s better to look up the brands size chart online first. 
2. I’ve had a few really bad experiences where I got items with huge holes/tears several inches long in the fabric. Happened twice in a row and was really unfortunate and strange honestly, but, that being said, thredUP has always ALWAYS worked with me and given me a refund. They have an A+++++++ in customer service. They are superb in that way. I think it’s because of that, that I’m not too afraid to just go for it and buy from here, knowing that if there’s an issue with an item, they’ll work with me. I have to say that I’ve been on here for several years now.. probably around the time they were just starting ThredUP, and they’ve really stepped up their game. Even better sales, more promotions etc etc. ThredUP is so good for the earth and for those on lower income, or who just want to save on the planet and on money.",4
55,"too big for their britches, slimy marketing: what i believe started out as a great idea quickly turned into the unfortunate. As a sustainably conscious consumer I was at first thrilled with the thred up concept. I put all my no longer needed items into a bag(i didn't even mind the clean out bag fee) I completely understand and support, paying for a convenient service. with that being said, it is highly disappointing to see that this is not the same idea or concept that is being passed down to consumers. At the end of the day this is a thrift store that is online, this is a place where used and formally worn clothing items are being sold, but the prices no longer reflect that. This is not any longer suited and ideal for sustainability. There is no value in having this thrift store because it is meant to make money and profits instead of protecting the sustainably conscious consumer. Used pants should not be sold for 40,60 or 80$
The idea started with smart and good intention but quickly turned wrong, greedy and does not foster a sustainable mindset. We need to make thrifting affordable to the masses so that our society encourages recycle efforts, and environmental tactics.. Instead Thred up just encourages people to pay to get rid of their clothes and then banks off of their good deed. it is slimy marketing👎🏾",2
56,"Nice idea but poor QC and getting pricier: I have been using ThredUP off and on for years both with the clean up service and purchasing from them. I’ve seen them offering less and less for your clean up items, increasing free shipping limit, and now charging restock fees. Charging shipping is fine but boy do you need patience! It takes over a week shipping within the mid-Atlantic and what you get some time (I’d say 1/3 of that time) is not what was described (measurement and condition). That’s beyond frustrating because it’s not like you can exchange it. Even though they refund fully for the item, you are still out the shipping cost you paid. Also, my other problem with them is the condition of the items that show signs of wear, whether it’s gently used or with minor flaws, they ought to show them in the pictures, especially when they are now charging restocking fee. I’ve purchased something with minor stain as advertised that turned out to be right in the front and obvious but not show through the low resolution pictures. Shoes, they ought to show the wear of the soles. 

With all that said, some times you do find incredible deals like getting designer jeans and shoes significantly discounted. But for regular brands, I think they are charging far too much.",3
57,"Ok for buying but do not sell: This service works well for purchases. I’ve had some very good luck and have used the option of store credit to avoid the high return shipping charge. However, their payout are EXTREMELY low. I would definitely NOT recommend selling.  I sent a couple of items that were essentially new (for example, a coat worn a handful of times and a brand new pair of pants worn once) that were not accepted. They accepted over 10 items for around a $13 payout and sell those items for around $150 on their site. Doesn’t feel like a fair rate. I will say, their website does say the payout will be lower than consignment stores or selling on your own. But the rejection of essentially new items makes me skeptical about how they choose items and made my expected payout vs my actual payout very disappointing. My advice would be to go to a local consignment store where you have the option of rejecting their offer. Or just donate and take the tax deduction.

To the app/service—perhaps sending the reason items were rejected with the payout email would help people have more success selling. I sent a pair of Ann Taylor pants I wore one time that were rejected. With no information about why I just don’t have a ton of motivation to try to send in another bag.",3
58,"Clean out kits: I’m sure this site is great for the shopper but not so much sellers/consigners. I sent in my clean out kit in September 22’ and I’m still waiting for it to be processed. It has been 5 months. I even reached out via email and never received a response. I’m ok with companies getting busy, it’s understandable, but their site has been reflecting a 4-6 week turn around during this time. Now they don’t have anything at all that reflects their clean out kit turn around. If your company is backed up, be transparent with potential sellers, reply to customers, send your sellers updates more often that once in a 5 month period. I likely won’t be using this service after my clean out kit is processed. Here’s to hoping it’s completed before the 6 month mark. UPDATE: it has been over 6 months now. Most of my items have sold but you don’t get paid our until 15 days AFTER the item is delivered. I realized today that my payout changed when someone bought one of my items but the original list price stayed the same. Please don’t waste your time with this company.

Update: it has been 7 months and I have only received payout for 1 of my 13 items and the rest have sold already. I have reached out to customer service 4 times and have never received a response. I’m blown away at how terrible it is to consign with this company.",1
59,"Great concept terrible execution. I will delete app.: I’ve given this app a fair try, but found it to be a huge waste of time and effort. I have yet to be able to add a single item to my cart to make a purchase. It’s always already in my cart (it’s not, my cart is empty), it’s already in someone else’s cart or someone else has “snatched it up.” If fact, I get all three of those errors in that order one after the other on every item when clicking on add to cart. Well, which is it?! On top of that, it will occasionally ask if I’d like to be notified when an item becomes available. This is what leads me to believe it’s sitting in someone’s cart who may never even purchase it. What a gimmick! 

I’m unsure if it’s a scam app full of items that have already been sold, or people are just permitted to load up their carts with items others want to purchase. Whatever the case, anything I try to add to my cart returns the same errors repeatedly. Nothing is ever available. If someone else snatched it up, why is it still appearing in searches to sell to users? A total waste of time and effort I could have spent somewhere else actually making a purchase. Great concept, terrible execution.  It should be first come first serve. The first person to actually make a purchase should get the item. I will be deleting this waste of time app.",1
60,"Like 50,000+ pieces for under $10: There are so many cute things on ThredUp. I love that you can organize your search by size, color, even what material the fabric is, by condition, if you want dresses, jackets, pants etc. It is SO convenient! say you needed only white cotton pieces for an art project? You could find a thousand things for cheap, in under a minute. I tell people it’s like a thrift store, but one that is completely customized so you don’t waste time looking through size XL pajamas… it’s my favorite place to get clothes. occasionally things aren’t correct, like the size isn’t what they said, or there aren’t actually tags on something NWT, but they’re processing so many pieces, I understand that occasionally things won’t be exact. On the inverse of that, you’re seeing exactly what you’ll get. So when you order something online ordinarily, the floral fabric (placement) won’t be what is advertised. With thredUP you’re seeing the exact item, which is cool

ThredUp is great. I hope it’s always around. It’s a better option than buying new and doing fast fashion. But it’s even cheaper somehow",5
61,"Love thredUP!!: I love love LOVE ThredUP!!! I use it all the time and I’m addicted to browsing all the thousands of items. The goody boxes are my favorite part. I’ve ordered several and it’s so much fun to see what I receive. There are a few things that could be improved. The search tool on the site is sometimes limiting, so you might have to wade through hundreds or thousands of items to find what you want. For example, you can’t type in a style of swimsuit top so you have to look through hundreds. Also the goody box “pickers” don’t always pay close attention to your feedback. A size 8 in one pair of pants is completely different in another style or brand. I tried to give feedback on measurements instead of size but I keep getting the same fit, so I just quit requesting pants. Not really a flaw but I wish there was a way to see outfit recommendations. For example, if you buy red jeans, it would be cool if the site recommended styles of tops or jewelry to build an outfit. With that being said, the site is constantly listening to customer feedback and improving. I’ve got several of my friends addicted to it. It’s my favorite site, my favorite app and I use it every single day. It’s my new Pinterest!",4
62,"Good to buy from, never ever sell with them.: Honestly, this place is good to buy from when they are doing some of their big sales. Good clothes for cheap and sometimes you can get a steal out of them. But that is also because there’s a limit to how high a seller can price their clothes at. I tried to sell 3 clothes and they had 1 day left so I tried to reclaim them. They said shipping rates apply so I thought okay, I can pay shipping to get them back I guess. But you also have to pay $5.99 per item to reclaim them plus shipping! I would never sell here again. You also only get paid about $1-4 out of anything under $30. I would rather sell it myself on poshmark. This place lowballs you and makes you sell at a certain price range and only pays you a teeny tiny portion (if it sells within a month since they only upload your items for a month). After a month listing they either keep your items or you can reclaim them but of course with a hefty price tag. I would have to pay $5.99+shipping to reclaim something when my profit from it would’ve been like $1.50. Basically don’t “sell” with them unless you are DONATING to them. Also, I just figured out that they continue to sell your items even after the 30 days, but you just don’t get the money from it selling anymore. Horrible place to sell",1
63,"Stinky search engine but amazing customer service: I’ve tried to love Thred Up for years now, but their search engine on the site is very frustrating to me. It’s definitely geared more towards name brand items or if you know the exact item you are looking for. Me, i like to be able to search “floral dresses” and maybe not knowing the brand and seeing what I like, you can’t do that very well on this site like you can others. Despite not loving the search engine, I was able to find a dress I was looking for. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size (my fault entirely). I emailed them asking if they could cancel my order because the item was final sale and I wouldn’t be able to return. They got back to me promptly letting me know they couldn’t cancel the order, but they could refund me the money and I could keep the item if it did happen to fit or donate it if not. Not very may companies would do something like that and I am very impressed. I am going to keep on trying to find my way through the search engine (maybe it’s me) so that I can support a company with such great customer service! Thank you, Thred Up!",5
64,"Sizes and color: I ordered a few time and was happy except for the fact that the color and size advertised is not always what you get, the photos don’t seem to show the actual colors in the right light and the sizes are sometimes wrong. I ordered a pair of shoes a size 7 1/2 that’s what the advertisement said the shoes I got wear the same shoes But they had to be at least a 9 or a 10 and I cannot wear those shoes they’re too big and I’m trying to get in touch with customer service to get a refund and I see that is a very complicated thing, also two purses with Misadvertised colors also in the photos, so I will probably never order from them again. Plus their prices are a little high for it to be thrift. I’m a huge thrifter I love doing that but maybe not from thredup anymore. Also I was going to send some items to them with their cleanup bag which I haven’t received yet but I’ve read reviews and I see they don’t give you pretty much anything for your items so I’ll continue to get rid of them the way I always have, Family members or the Goodwill.
Update: thredUP refund me for the wrong size shoes, restored my faith,",5
65,"Looove: I love thredup. I’m never disappointed in the quality of items I receive, even when they’re gently used or show signs of wear. Always make sure to read the description and look closely at photos though so you don’t end up with a stain you didn’t want. All the imperfections are usually listed. For the people who say they got the wrong size and reviews like that...honestly that’s their fault because most items have actual measurements. All garments are sized differently and you can usually tell how it’ll fit by looking at it in the mannequin...if you look at ONLY the size, that’s on you. I haven’t had to return anything yet but the process seems super easy and the $5.99 deposit for my bundles is always refunded very quickly once the bundle ships. I have no complaints at all...I love this app. I try to buy secondhand whenever possible and this is my favorite place to buy...better than Poshmark for sure. I highly recommend this app for plus sized women too...they have torrid and other like brands for super affordable prices if you need nice clothes for work or church.",5
66,"Great concept but app is faulty and item descriptions are often wrong: I’m updating my review. I must change it to 1 star because it is IMPOSSIBLE to reach customer service. I have made numerous attempts over chat, email, the support web page, Facebook messenger, and voicemail for several days and have not received a single response. I will not be purchasing from Thredup again until I receive a response, a resolution for my problem, and assurance that I will be able to reach customer service in the future. Currently, customer service is nonexistent. 

I generally like buying from thredUP. I have found some great pieces here and the process is easy with free shipping and free returns if you take a credit. But the app crashes all the time and it can take a while for orders to arrive. Also, the filters on the app don’t always work - sometimes, adding a filter will cause MORE items to appear in the results, which makes no sense. Also, items are often categorized incorrectly so long-sleeved shirts show up in the short-sleeved category, J Jill items appear under J Crew, etc. I’ve also received several items that had damage (stains, bleaching, or even holes) that was not in the description. It’s also hard to see details in the photos on the app, so I’m often surprised when I receive an item and it looks totally different in person than it did in the photo.",1
67,"Really great service, but app hard to navigate: I really love this business model and the fact that the second hand clothing is being evaluated by a company rather than an individual seller, but I the app is difficult to navigate. Sorting is difficult because you can search by garment type but not specific style. Also, I would prefer if the categories were less gendered. I will say that as a fat person, this service is very accessible to me! I love shopping second hand but most thrift shops/consignment stores don’t carry good plus size items.  buying things from ThredUP! That said, I really wish they would have more identifiers listed for the items. It is very difficult to find anything specific. For example, you can’t search by pattern or key words. The item titles are things like “Lane Bryant Casual Skirt” — doesn’t tell you anything about length, color, etc. I do really like that you can set your own personal sizes (both for clothing and for shoes) so you don’t have to wade through a bunch of useless items. Again, LOVE buying things from the app and have had great experience with the actual items I’ve purchased, it’s just that the navigation system really needs some work.",3
68,Bad customer service: I ordered a few things from threadUP just recently. It was my first time ever buying from them. Out of my package there was one pair of jeans that didn’t fit properly. I looked on the listing and realized that threadUP had measured the jeans wrong. The waist said it was three inches bigger and the inseam two inches longer. I contacted customer service and she tried to tell me that the measurements were “an estimate of what is expected after the garment had been worn.” I looked at the section she claimed that this was written under and it said no such thing. I contacted her back saying this and she said that the jeans were technically classified under the size 27 category so she would not refund me. I said well even if they are technically classified as size 27 the measurements are still wrong so you have conflicting information on the listing. She just simply messaged me back saying that they will not refund me for the jeans. I went to the App Store after this and looked at the reviews for thredUP. Many people reported poor customer service and the items they purchased not coming as described in the listing. Even though I bought several items and the rest of them were fine I don’t think I will ever shop with thredUP again because you can’t trust the listings and it’s doubtful if there is an issue that the company will do anything about it.,1
69,"Trying to do better for the planet: A few of the podcasts I listen to are sponsored by ThredUP.  Intrigued by new services and since I want to support the companies that sponsor my favorite podcasts, I decided to give ThredUP a try.  I admit that I was a bit leery at first because there’s something about used clothes that skeeves me out a little.  But after downloading the app and browsing around, I found a few pieces that I liked and for great prices too.  Fast forward to not even a month later and I already ordered from ThredUP 3 times!  I’ve refreshed my closet and hopefully not contributed to all the waste that goes on with the fast fashion industry.  Quality of the items is really good, and I found that if I just pop the items in the wash as soon as I get them, they’re ready to wear and no funky odors or anything.  Buying on the app is very easy, as is keeping track of my orders and favoriting items.  My one complaint is that I can’t order a closet clean out kit as I am a Hawaii resident, but maybe that’s for the best as I read that ThredUP is very selective in the clothing that they will resell.",5
70,"Love ThredUP!: I’ve only been buying for a few months, but I love it!  The amount of items I get for the price, definitely has me hooked. Mostly I purchase fairly basic items, a shirt or tank top to add a pop of color to an outfit. But I’m addicted to the maxi skirts. There are so many great prints and colors to choose from, it’s almost hard to make a decision.  
I’ve never had any problems with an item. I look closely at the pictures and read over the description to make my final decisions. Knowing your sizes in certain brands really helps.
I have used the clean out bag and I’m about to send another.  I will say I didn’t realize they were no longer taking jewelry and I had some nice, salable pieces. I like that I can get a little credit toward my purchase. Also, it’s nice that you can see the progression of your items that are selling.  Watching the items go from someone’s favorite to being sold is satisfying. Not to mention, must easier than listing them on another site to sell.  ThredUP donating the excess items is a real plus, because that’s what I would be doing with my items anyway.
I highly recommend ThredUP!!",5
71,"Wish they had ‘Reps’-I’d be one!!!: It has been a LOOOONG time since there has been a retail company that I would stand behind. I am SO passionate about Thred Up! I have worked in the fashion industry for an extended period of time and Thred Up has really brought all aspects to the table for the consumer. They are doing their part to recycle and keep as much as possible out of landfills. They offer on trend items as well as a few vintage items. The item descriptions are honest; if it’s been loved, they will mention it. The pricing is extremely competitive and the return process is SO easy! There are options everywhere, from the goodie boxes (with no contract!!!) just the low flat fee that still goes toward you purchase, to the ability to sell and consign your own stuff, to the multiple payment options on selling and returns; you literally get everything with Thred Up. I have suggested Thred Up to all of my friends and family and even strangers that compliment a secondhand piece that i might be wearing. I would literally recommend them to everyone! Thred Up has definitely earned my business for life!",5
72,"Slow shipping, unresponsive customer service: Such a great concept, which is why I’m putting my review at three stars; I just love browsing all the clothes, such variety.  I’ve placed a few large orders with ThredUP over the past year.   My frustration comes from the fact that they’re super slow when it comes to processing and shipping.  While I paid for expedited shipping for an order I placed over a week ago, the bulk of my order still hasn’t shipped.  They sent tracking to me immediately after placing, but FedEx still hasn’t received my package.  I tried to contact customer support, and the message I received that they’re so backed up on helping customers that it would be 2-3 days before they could respond to my concerns.  However, I’m leaving for vacation in 3 days, so I doubt I’ll get my package before I leave which is what I bought some of the pieces for.  Not to mention, I’m going to have to arrange someone to pick up my package while I’m out of town, so it’s not sitting in my doorstep for two weeks.  Depending on how this experience plays out, I’m not sure if I’ll be using ThredUP anymore. If it honestly takes 2-3 days to get back to a customer who is frustrated and looking for help, then you really need to hire more staff.",3
73,"Employees take the good stuff and sell the rest: I sent in 2 bags of clothes to thredUP because I thought it was a neat idea and I liked the thought of someone else getting to use clothes that I had barely worn and were just sitting in my closet. Sending them in seemed so easy. I always paid to have the items they did not want returned to me but I noticed that all the new items I had sent in, including a brand new pair of Kate spade earrings and a pair of Nike shorts with tags still attached, were missing. I contacted thredUP and they told me they couldn’t find them and gave me $4. To me, it’s not about the money it’s about the fact that someone could have bought those items and used them for a fraction of the price but instead they were basically stolen in my opinion. I also have read online that this has happened to other people sending in expensive items such as Louis Vuitton purses. It’s really a shame. I really really wanted to like this company but it’s a huge scam. Clearly all the good items are taken before they even make it online. The ones that do make it online are way overpriced for what they are. I would think twice before purchasing or sending in any clothes to them.
Thank you for your response, and that’s fine if you don’t accept my items, but when I ask for my kit back, I expect ALL my items to be returned to me.",1
74,"Terrible customer service: The app is pretty user friendly. I don’t have any complaints about that, but their customer service has gone down hill from several years ago when they first started the company. First off, sending a “clean out bag” sounds nice until you see that you get as an average 30 cents per item or less and then they resell it for $10-$15. They could at least give you a $1 an item. That’s worse than any consignment shop I’ve ever sold my clothes to. Second, they only accept certain items you send them which is understandable, but the clothes I have bought from them before we’re more used condition than what I sent in. I had brand new with tag items that I sent in and they didn’t even list those to sell. I send 66 items and they listed 22 for sale. In the end I was able to claim $10 but if I wanted to just get the cash it would only give me $6. So of course I bought one item with what they gave me. I couldn’t believe I send 66 items to basically trade it for one used item. Third and last they sent a item that stated it was one size and the tag was clearly marked a smaller size. I have contacted them about this and have sent photos and no one has ever gotten back to me. Before when I ordered and had issues they were quick to respond and fix issues. Now it’s like they don’t even care.",1
75,"Love the app but links are frequently broken: I have a lot of secondhand clothing apps that I frequently use, and ThredUp is definitely in my top three. However, it is extremely aggravating when I click the links for advertisements from ThredUp on other sites (like instagram) that successfully open the app, but don’t actually lead to the listing/item advertised. Even if the item hasn’t been sold or is no longer available, I’m often so interested in the items I get advertised that I at least want to open up the listing just to see more details about it, so that if I decide to try and find similar items on ThredUp or other apps then I at least have more information I can use in my search. It’s very frustrating how ThredUp can have such great items sometimes and is able to accurately target ads to me for things I would be interested in, only for me to not actually even be able to find or learn more about the item. Sometimes I’ll have five broken links in a row until I just give up from the whole ordeal. Fixing this issue would absolutely improve my experience, as I have almost no other complaints but this one — which is aggravating enough to make this a 3-star experience for me.",2
76,"Disappointed, you lost a customer.: In the past I was able to at least get $9-$18 upfront payout depending on the bag sent in. It was at least enough to turn around and get an item for one of my kids. Items sold much faster then. With the new form of only consignment payout you basically get nothing. Items aren’t selling like they used to before. And if they don’t sell they keep them unless you pay to get it back. I also noticed they would not list some of my items that were quality, like new items, yet I’d see the exact same thing in another size in a very used quality being sold. My experience in receiving items has not been so great lately as well. My last item smelled heavily of nasty perfume it was nauseating. And by the time you pay to return it, you don’t get any money back on the refund. Not to mention used items are priced way to high. An old navy kids shirt in very used condition from this last summer listed for $7.99 when you can buy a new one from the store for $6.99. How am I saving money considering you have to pay for shipping on top of that? I regret sending in my last bag. I should have just donated to a reputable organization. I won’t be purchasing or sending in anything anymore. You lost a customer and I no longer feel the need to further tell friends/family about your site.",1
77,"Valuable Asset But Room for Improvement!: As someone who appreciates giving clothing a second life and saving clothes from the dump, I really appreciate this app. It’s easy to accumulate reward points if you send in a kit of items you’d like to sell or donate, visit the website/app often, etc. so you can put your points towards free shipping or getting money off your order. I’ve purchased a bunch of things I’ve been really happy with. However, as other reviewers have stated, there can be a lot of missing information and mistakes in the listings. Need more measurements and photos included, the measurements are sometimes incorrect, bottoms described as high, medium, or low rise seems totally off to me a lot of the time, and in one of my kits of clothing I was selling, they included photos of a completely different shirt than what I had sent in. I don’t know if they swapped my top with someone else’s or what but it’s very hard to talk to a human about these kind of errors. Recently I’ve found that shipping time has gotten better but I do wish they would start accepting men’s clothing and improve the listing descriptions.",4
78,"Worth it: I love thredup. As a grad student I don’t have a lot of money but still want clothes and I dont have the patience for thrift shopping in person, so thredup works for me. I have had no issues with anything I’ve purchased so far (and I have purchased a lot of clothes thus far from them). I purchase mostly tops as theyre less risky than pants shopping online IMO, but I bought a purse, too. The pants I have purchased from them were great, too, I just prefer to play it safe.

I’d say most of the prices are very fair and they often have sales/sale codes to use to save even more money. One thing is that there is simply SO MANY clothes that its often daunting shopping on here, so its best to have a specific brand and category (i.e. abercrombie sweaters) in mind that helps make sifting through items more efficient. There are also filters for condition of the clothes like New with Tags, Like New, etc that you can use. 

The only negative is that it does take a good bit of time to receive the items, usually about 2-3 weeks, but worth it!",5
79,"Good Concept Bad Execution: I love buying gently used clothes for environmental reasons and really want to love threadup but after browsing, buying and selling with them many times I am less than impressed. The search function is horrendous, if you want to find for instance a dress with hearts on it you have to search through the 10,000 dresses they have listed. If they refined the search function it would be so much easier to shop with them, I end up just giving up from being tired of scrolling. A lot of the pricing is very off, it seems the default retail is $110, I’ve seen American Eagle items marked as $110 retail and selling used for $40, that’s more than in store!!! The payout for selling is also far less than any other second hand store I’ve sold too. I wasn’t expecting to make a lot of money at all but $1 on an item they were selling for $20 made me frustrated it’s better to just give the item away for free instead of shipping it across the US. I should’ve known because my friend had warned me a year ago that the did the same thing to her. They also charge for item returns both for buyers and sellers. You can find a good deal on ThreadUp but you need to be careful and really search.",3
80,"Great for both buying and selling!!: I’ve loved this app for awhile for buying from Thredup - generally happy with whatever I’ve purchased and I appreciate being able to make returns. 

I’ve recently started selling on Thredup and I’m really impressed!  Yes, the payout is low on “paid upfront” items so I take that into consideration when deciding what to send in.  But the items taken for consignment have a good payout.  Having used several other selling platforms I’m very impressed with the transparency of Thredup (in your account you can see exactly which items they’ve kept, how much they’re selling for, you can change their selling price, see how many “likes” each item is getting from buyers, what sells and when it sells, etc and you can transfer your sales to a prepaid visa without being charged an additional percentage, unlike other platforms). And I like the “return assurance” option. Yes I have some items that I choose not to send into Thredup for payout reasons but I’m VERY impressed with the site traffic and how quickly the items I send in to them, SELL!",5
81,"Very disappointed: I can’t speak for buying clothes from this site since the reviews seem to be pretty positive about that but I got a clean out bag back in June and was told it would be processed sometime in July. That date came and went and I was met with radio silence from them only a status saying it was received , I contacted a few days after the date of processing and got a response saying that there were many many bags that need to be processed and my date had been pushed back farther which is understandable, small business maybe not that many workers and such so I let it go and waited for the next date and checked and once again was met with nothing but a received status and another push back date. I went back and forth with this company for about 4 months waiting for anything different and only got told my clothes were still being processed. I contacted again today and once again was told I would have to wait longer. It feels like this clean out bag was a bit to good to be true, I hope to have a better experience with buying clothes from this app because it is a very good idea and they do have a wide variety of clothes but still, extremely disappointing",2
82,"DO NOT SELL TO THEM: Not only is the pay out structure horrible, but you’re  only allowed 7 days for the person to ‘accept’ the payout - which makes no sense.  Why would anyone reject it? I gave you my clothes to sell, you sold them and then because I didn’t respond to an email within 1 week the money and clothes are completely gone. Why would you need my permission to send me money that I’m already expecting for your services? And what’s the alternative? To say no - you have my clothes anyway! I was really hoping this would work but it’s a complete failure as far as selling clothes thru this service unless you’re willing to accept literally pennies on the dollar for high end items and be ready to accept your ‘offer’ ASAP (after you’ve waited the 5-6 weeks for your bag to be processed). Or else you’ll be left with nothing. Never again ThredUP will you get my clothes - I’d rather take my chances at my local Platos closet at this point. DONT DO IT PEOPLE IM TELLING YOU NOW

Update: they sold the most expensive item I sent to them - a brand new never been worn BCBG leather jacket worth over $200 and not only did they sell it but they gave someone else the money for the sale and every time some one tells me they’re going to ‘look into it’ they never get back to me. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER I LITERALLY HOPE THIS PLACE GOES OUT OF BUSINESS",1
83,"Pros and cons: I love that this app makes second hand shopping so much easier by being online versus going to multiple thrift stores. I do wish that there was maybe a suggested for you section based on likes and past purchases but it is still a much more eco friendly way to shop. I did buy a pair of boots last year where the entire sole was coming apart so I had to pay to have the sole reattached and I was only refunded half the purchase price when I was told I would be getting a full refund. Customer service could definitely be better. I followed up a few times but never got a response. All in all I’ve made a few orders and have been pretty happy with what I have received.   

I did also expect to get a little more money for items I sent in to sell but I get that they are taking all of the pictures and storing everything so it is what it is. Just know if you sent thing in you will be getting pennies to the dollar.

In conclusion, I support this app 100% . Sure there are a few things that could be better but over all I am reducing my environmental foot print and get to shop from my phone so I’m happy.",4
84,"Use With Discretion: The app crashes a lot and the delivery of my purchases has been rather slow. The return policy seems like a nightmare so I only buy items I suspect I’ll really love. I won’t use the app to sell anything based on the reviews I’ve read, but I received the items in a very cute package and I like that the website is user friendly with great brands. I’ve never bought anything second hand before but this app has a great model and some beautiful pieces. It’s a little hard to search at times and if you do your googles, they often say the original price is higher than a lot of these pieces actually are. Be mindful of that! It may not be the amazing deal they’re claiming. But I’ve gotten some good pieces and they’ve always been good quality in great condition.

Update- they reached out to me with their return process. I don’t need to return anything, but I will note I received 2 items with small permanent stains and 1 sweater with a pull, all of which were sold under the listing “you may mistake it for brand new!” Quality control may be slipping. Buyer beware! Personally I would never buy anything with signs of wear, so this makes me think twice about future purchases.",3
85,"Avoid.. unless you’re selling. Wished I hadn’t used it.: Soo they cheat in return time it starts when you order NOT when you receive the package so your 14 days return is out of the package takes 12 days and gives you like a day and half if it arrives later @ night and you know Evening isn’t the time to open boxes after long work day. to open and try out. bought something that said “New with tags on” BUT when I received it.. there’s no tag and items looked used, worn. The purses were the same. Used. Basically paying higher prices for used when Ross, TJ MAXX would’ve been new.. and maybe cheaper too; people may have tried on things but is not same as worn/
 used with their sweat, smell on.. and strange is bought a WOMEN’s Calvin Klein jacket but has disgusting smell of a man on it.. gross. Had to trash that. Much Money wasted. Tried their “Customer Support” and it goes nowhere. Also had 2 dresses missing, not included in my order.. tried to get these resolved with CS and no luck. Rip off!!
2 stars were the new Hollister jacket that was decent for the winter. I could’ve just bought that one. 
So caveat emptor! Maybe gamble and get just 1 thing you know is a steal deal but keep it limited /conservative.",2
86,"Fantastic! Minus one snag.: I love this app. It’s thrift store shopping made easy. You can shop via brand or article of clothing and narrow searches using filters such as price, size, color, etcetera. You can earn points with each purchase and apply said points to get free shipping or $10 off your order or to waive restocking fees, and so on. My only complaint is that when ordering skirts, the length of the skirt is listed but not the waist measurements in inches. I can fit into a medium or a large depending on the brand. Seeing as sizing is so inconsistent item to item, brand to brand, it’s more consequential to have the waist measurements than the specifics of length in order to understand if the item is going to fit. And this wouldn’t be such a big deal if shipping and restocking were free, but as they aren’t, it’s a gamble and often a waste of money to buy skirts through this app. I live in skirts, so this is a disappointment for me personally. Hopefully ThredUP will take this into account and make the minor adjustment to better inform their customers.",5
87,"I love it!: I really love thredUP! You can find almost anything on it, and I have always been satisfied with my purchases. It is also MOSTLY really easy to use, at times it can be a little confusing. I would recommend this app to anyone, especially if they are someone like me how doesn’t want to spend their money on clothes! They have so many chooses and you can find things from a Lululemon skirt to a turtleneck! And, they also update their clothes all the time so you always have new chooses and find things that you didn’t see before and maybe the item you where looking for! The only thing that’s kinda annoying is that if you heart things in hope that you will buy them later, some one might put it in their cart and then you can’t buy it 😢, and also if you put something in your cart you need to buy it ASAP or it will be taken out of your cart. But of course, that’s what they have to do because they don’t have a restock of each piece of clothing! Anyway, I love it so much and hope that you will to and don’t have any bad experiences!",5
88,"Love it for Buying and Selling!: I have been using ThredUp for over a year now. I love it! I rarely buy clothes anywhere else now. There are so many unique finds by brands I love. The prices are usually great. (Keep in mind it is not ThredUp setting those prices when they are too high!) All of my items have come as expected and returns have gone smoothly. I have gone back and forth with over 200 items between selling, buying, and returning items. You do have to have patience to both buy and sell here. There are not fast shipping options. Other than fast shipping, I wish I had the option to cancel or edit an order after it has been placed. I also get a little annoyed with 1 hour cart times when they have sales... I have lost a few things I was planning on buying that way. I am sure they are equally a little annoyed with me for holding onto to stuff in my cart forever so that is fair. Overall, I love it and recommend it every time I get a compliment on my clothes from there which is often.",5
89,"Love thredup: I’ve been using thredup for years, and have recommended to many people. Whether you need a formal or a just need to fill holes in your wardrobe, it is great. The filters are awesome. You can filter by category, size, color, condition, etc. There are thousands and thousands of items but I can always filter down to a manageable amount to choose from. The site has improved over the years and I have no complaints regarding customer service, condition of items received, timeliness of orders received, etc.

I have 2 things they could improve on... one is the lack of detail in photographs of black clothing (maybe use a side light or something to show fabric/stitching details?), the second is no photos of the inside of purses. Many of the Brighton purses thredup has are the type that have wallets built in (I know because I have them). But the description only says “crossbody”, with no details or inside photos. And purses are NOT returnable. I’d love to know what other brands thredup has are those type as well. I would buy all my purses here if that were the case.",5
90,"So much stuff!: I’m a bit obsessed with thredup now. I’ve always been a thrift store shopper, but I couldn’t find full length pants (ugh-ankle and capri pants are not my friends) any more at the thrift stores or even new at retail stores.  I read about thredup in an article and thought it was worth a shot.  Maybe I’d find some 10 to 15 year old pairs from a time when pants were made with the entire leg. I found so many pairs of full length pants (not to mention a bunch of other stuff) that hopefully ankle pants will be out of style long before the ones I bought wear out.  I got shorts, jeans, jackets, skirts, you name it.  I also found work appropriate, timelessly styled clothes that I was having a hard time finding new.  This is a treasure trove for work clothes.  I am much better dressed for work now.  If that isn’t your thing, don’t worry-they do have a boatloads (I mean boatloads!) of trendy clothes for younger gals too.  The items I’ve gotten have all been in really good shape too.  I get complements all the time on my clothes nowadays.",5
91,"BEST CLOTHING APP EVER ??!?!: Ok so. I just want to start by saying I NEVER leave app reviews, even if the app entices me by some sort of freebie or whatever lol. But THIS app ?? Omg…What’s not to love? I hate hate hate online shopping, you have to worry about the material, sizing charts, reviews..yada yada yada 🤦🏽‍♀️ But I went ahead and tried this app one day and honey, let me tell you, this is the best clothing app I have EVER experienced. Shein, who? Fashion Nova, Who? ThreadUp, Yess! Sustainability? Yess!! Literally stop what you’re doing and get this app, like right now. The mission behind the app, and the packaging is just a wonderful experience! It is amazing! I got 16 items for 133$ !! Anddd on top of that, all of them fit and had great materials, So I didn’t have to worry about off, chinese sizing (looking at you shein 😒) I could go on and on and on, but I won’t. I will just tell you to experience it yourself. What do you have to lose? (Pro-tip: Get a tape measurer and take down your measurements for the most accurate fit for your products. Trust me, it’s easier than you think.😉)",5
92,"Expansion isn’t always in the best interest in the consumer!: I have been ThredUP’s biggest fan for over a year and have spent thousands of dollars on some beautiful clothes and shoes. But in the last 6 months things have changed and in my opinion not benefiting the consumer. Prices have increased especially if the clothes are coming from a warehouse that isn’t the closest one to you. The bidding is just another example of “if it isn’t broken don’t fix it.” The website is less user friendly and more expensive. Some of the clothes are cheaper to purchase at the store they came from rather than on ThredUP.  I thought T.U. was about saving money AND saving the earth. Now it seems that it is about you making larger and larger profits. And I’m paying    
more for the same products with less quality.
I still support your company but I will stop buying so much since the prices have increased while the quality is going down. Thanks for listening.  Teresa Brown Mannikko

93,"Convenient but...: Really liked Thred Up before! From my (somewhat limited) experience, good customer service and great prices. Returning is super easy and free if you get store credit, and I love the way it looks. However, I miss the ability to see what is trending or sort by having the most likes. (At this point, I don’t even remember what it used to be before it changed.) Now one can only sort by newest and price. There are so many options, I find this to be overwhelming, and it makes it harder to find unique items of interest. 

Another caveat: they are currently featuring Reformation as a sustainable brand that helps the environment, but Reformation has atrocious labor practices and is not “ethical,” in spite of their branding. 

Though as an app, it is very well-designed (hence the 4 star rating), my enthusiasm has waned so much that I have deleted the app multiple times and am thinking of deleting it again. It’s hard to be motivated to sort through the many, many new items. Its convenience is one reason I prefer using this app to shopping in person. (Well, preferred before the coronavirus remixed the second option.)",4
94,"Needle in a haystack shopping because size filters are too wide: I have sold many items on ThredUP. Payout $are not great but it is fun to shop with credit. Two app function improvements would make a better shopping experience: 

1. Let the seller post a sentence or two about the item.  A comment from a seller about fit, reason for letting it go, attributes of the item, or to correct something missing in the description could add info that would make me confidently select more items. Yes sellers  could exaggerate, but buyer beware. Maybe help in making less returns. 

2.  I know my size in specific brands and I want to shop for that size in those brands.  I enter that size and get “my sizes” results that are my size, in addition I get the next size up and all results of regular, “(plus)”, x, w.  Please change the “my sizes” filter to be what I enter, then make a search option for “similar sizes” to include all those variations. I won’t buy a similar size online without trying it on, and I get hundreds and thousands of search results which could be cut down to a manageable list, if only I could filter for my size exactly.",3
95,"Buyer Beware/Seller Save your goods: Super excited w the concept and sent for a clean out bag which I stuffed w seasonal clothing, clean and as carefully packed and folded as possible. Ironically, the items I was excited to sell-the never worn Dansko shoes (packed in ind baggies) Brighton, Miss Me, LuLu and others never showed up in my sell items. They did, however, pk out and list all the more common pieces-JC Penney, Old Navy and Target. Nothing against those brands! I wear them. But what happened to the lesser/never worn items? I live in a smoke free home. I don’t even donate items that I wouldn’t consider wearing. But when I did place an order, I recieved a Juicy Couture sweater that had stains on the sleeve and smelled like stale perfume, a sweater that was pilling quite badly and I would not have sent in and an item listed as a women’s M but was a child’s shirt. Ok. Mistakes happen, but I was charged a restocking fee. As a buyer, remember the items have been worn and washed-so they probably shrunk. And they don’t differentiate between JR and Misses sizes sooo if you wear a Miss M and it’s a JR M, you’re paying a restocking fee. They also resell shoes made from factories in  China that run 1-2 sizes smaller than stated soo, you’re paying a restocking fee. As for selling? I’m opening a Posh acct so I can get a fair dollar. Whatever happened to those really nice items?? 🤔",1
96,"Never Need To Shop Anywhere Else Again!: I was just finishing high school and was starting to think about what to take with me to college. My book collection was a must have and my comfy pillows but when I looked at my closet, I didn’t feel very confident or happy in the clothes I had. I’m the kind of person who wears what they have because it works and most of my clothes then were Christmas presents or off the clearance rack. Nothing I really felt like a competent adult should wear.
And then I found ThredUP. I could totally overhaul my whole wardrobe with quality pieces that would actually last me a long time at prices a future starving college student could afford! 
The only reason this app gets four stars instead of five is that there are something’s that can be improved on the website; such as the lack of waist measurements on skirts, only two pictures of each item, or the inability to search in the outlet section. But I think all these little things will be fixed with time and for now they have a wonderful customer service and return program!",4
97,"{insert comment about TU inserting without care of friction, preferably in the dark from behind}: I have been consigning with thread up for about a year now, the app has always been atrocious, notifications do not come when they are supposed to, prices and payout structure is change all the time, to even see your full menu, you need to go to cash out, so you have to keep a balance, then once you click cash out, you have to tap the upper left-hand menu button before scrolling down, or else you don't get that button back. 

I have put up with it, but recently, after doing everything in my power to make sure my things were sent to me, many items of mine were sent 1200 miles away where I have no chance of getting them, and in contacting customer support, again, for the same reason of ensuring my address was correct, items expired and magically completely disappeared from my account. Luckily they were in my recent's, and putting them in my cart comes out to almost $600. For my things I wanted returned to me, and explained to customer service that these items were about to expire.

I just lost approximately $1000 worth of clothes shoes and purses, because of their incompetence and not following through with something they said they would do.",1
98,"A few things could use some improving: For example, if you’re looking for something specific like “velvet dress” ….searching that term does not pull up velvet dresses. That doesn’t mean ThredUp doesn’t have any velvet dresses, it’s just that of the secondhand apps I’ve used (poshmark and Kidizen being the two other most frequent), ThredUp has the least user-friendly search system. I also wish there was a way to find similar items to things you like. So if I click on a top but it’s already in someone’s cart, it would be nice if I could find similar tops. All that being said, there is a lot of really great stuff on ThredUp and I think the prices are usually better than other secondhand apps. Plus, you can return things to ThredUp and in my experience, that’s not usually an option when you buy something from poshmark or Kidizen. Overall, it’s my favorite app for buying adult clothes. But if you’re looking for something specific (like a pair of shoes you loved and you want the exact same pair), then you’re better off searching other sites/apps.",4
99,"Don’t send your stuff here: 2 Stars because ThredUp makes buying products easy. I like that we can have the product in our cart for 24 hours while we think about purchasing. They take decent pictures. However, there’s not a lot of pictures, usually just two or three, and if the product description says things like “minor stain” or “minor snag”, they don’t show pictures of the defects so it’s hard to judge for yourself how bad the damage is. 

DO NOT BOTHER SENDING IN YOUR STUFF. I know the website says payout is low, but it’s so so incredibly low. I sent in a brand new Vera Bradley iPad case AND bag, and they retailed and sold both for $35+ and the payout I got was like $5 if that. I also sent in scarves (both with tags.. never been worn) which they listed on their site for $9.99 and my payout was .45 cents. RIDICULOUS. I also sent in a brand new vest which they “responsibly recycled” because it’s not “in season”. I figured they would accept it since it’s brand spaking new and definitely would have sold so I didn’t bother spending the $10 or whatever it is for insurance for them to send me my stuff back in case they didn’t accept it. 

I have so much more I could say, but the main point is do not send them your stuff. You WILL regret it.",2
100,"Failing grade: I have used thread up for several years. It’s not the easiest way to shop or even the cheapest but I have learned to make it work. And my good choices have outweighed the poor ones. Sadly, things changed  not too long ago, while they have never been the easiest to communicate with, it is now like communicating with a candy bar machine that took the money and didn’t deliver. They is NO communication! It is all automated. The last time I bought a box full of “nearly new” or “new with tags” I had three items with holes. This time I have two. Never before have I had a hole that I recall not being able to return. All but one of five were non-returnable so I’m stuck. I tried communicating both times with zero response. 
Beyond that one would think a company focused on the environment wouldn’t be using the toxic freshening sprays. They are becoming harder to get out 
of clothing absolutely tuning a garment. Perhaps ThreadUp will hear enough poor reviews to straighten out the qualities issues.",5
101,"Not what it used to be: ThredUP used to be as good or better than taking stuff to an in-person consignment store. Since its massive growth in the last few years, all its changes have been for the worse. I used to be able to submit a sizable kit and a few months later (at the very latest) I would get some store credit to buy one or two items at a reasonable rate for used stuff. Here’s what happens now: you have to print your own label and stuff as much as you possibly can in a box or bag, because if you do separate labels, they charge a $15 handling fee for EACH label. This is bonkers. Also their prices are crazily inflated for used clothing items, especially the lower quality brands they are willing to accept. They focus on designer but not necessarily quality or recent fashion. Also their app and webpage are bulky and tough to use, because they have so many hundreds of thousands of items, they load forever and ever and don’t sort themselves very well. I love what it used to be, I don’t love what it’s become. Go back to your roots, guys. Don’t accept so much crap so we can actually enjoy using  your service! Or maybe it’s time for a new player in the marketplace to operate on what made ThredUP great in the first place.",1
102,"Buying okay but DO NOT SELL!!: I have been purchasing items off of thred up for almost a year now, been very pleased. Until now, I thought hey I will sell to them some top quality things I have out grown then purchase some things that would fit. Things just sitting in my closet, could have sold the stuff on Facebook marketplace and gotten a fair price, but don't expect a fair price from thred up! I should have really just donated the items to goodwill, at least I would have gotten a donation receipt! With thred up I got like 5 dollars, 5 dollars for a full bag!!! Are you kidding me! Just down right no better than a scam.  The things I sent in where slightly worn or almost mistaken for new but apparently someone will be lining their pockets from my mistake of not reading the reviews. Would not recommend to no one! Do not sell to thred up! Purchase from them, yes.....now I know how they sell things so cheap....it's called a play on your customers trust! Will be in search of new site to purchase used clothing from. Sell at your own risk..........",5
103,Run far away: I had purchased multiple things from them in the past with 0 issue. In fact I loved this app. Last year I finally took the time to individually hand pick pieces from my closet to sell that I no longer used. I looked over every single thing they listed as acceptable items and checked each piece. I was Skeptical of other reviews so I photographed every item prior to sending as I did not want to pay to have them returned. But surprise Two out of three of my big ticket items were not “up to their standards”. One of these was a brand new pair of designer shoes. I reached out to customer service explaining why I was upset and got no response. I reached out a second time with attached photos of what I was angry about and finally received a response saying my bag was processed to their standards and my shoes were dirty. No comment on my photos. They were brand new! I attached additional photos including the spotless soles of the shoes saying obvious it was not processed and one of their employees is walking around in my shoes. The response I got was “well I guess your clothes transferred color to the shoes upon shipment in the bag”. Well guess what they were all in boxes!! This place is a joke. Sell designer on the real real. Their is a reason they have so many more items for sale.,1
104,"Many changes, not for the best: I have been shopping with ThredUp since 2015, and have been a loyal customer, spending thousands over the years. Initially free returns, then free returns with credit, then free returns, but you get charged $1.99 for every item you returned. At least you would get credit when you went yo the post office with their label. Apparently no more, with no notice I did not get my “boom, just like that” confirmation email with my credit. No notification. After 5 days, I used the chat function - they now are going to start waiting until the post office returns the item (keep in mind, their shipping label and with the post office these days…) and they take 3-5 days to process AFTER receiving from the post office. Still charging $1.99 extra, and it could take over 2 weeks after dropping off at the post office. No communication indicating this change…no way for the customer to know if it is being processed. In addition to taking six months for a bag to be processed with some very expensive items for store credit (kooba bags, some missoni) that was supposed to take 3 months per notification, they may soon be losing a long-time customer.",2
105,"Wouldn’t recommend: I had high hopes for this app, because it really is a solid concept. However, after searching for a couple days I finally found what I was looking for so of course I placed the order! The confirmation told me it was being shipping out of Pennsylvania and I live in California so okay, I never had expectations for the dress to get to me instantly. My issue is, I placed the order on Oct. 8. They accepted my payment of course and I was provided a tracking number. When I did not receive an email saying that the item had shipped I started watching online via the tracking number. The one item I ordered was not even dropped off to FedEx until Oct. 13. (With the 8th being a Sunday, that’s 4 whole business days.) Now mind you when I placed the order, the shipping was provided at 3-8 business days. Okay, fine. But now my item has arrived in Ohio, where the status has not changed since Monday Oct. 16. I understand that today Oct. 17, is only 3 business days, but my expected delivery date isn’t until Oct. 28. 

I have called customer service and their best advice, is to “hang tight” 

Such a waste of time and money! I’ll never order from this site again and will HIGHLY recommend my friends look elsewhere!",2
106,"Easy way to pass on unwanted clothes: ThredUP is an easy way to get rid of unwanted clothes & get something for them vs donating them.  You won’t get much, but it saves you the work of selling them yourself (which is basically a 2nd job, I tried it & it wasn’t worth the time & trouble).  I always have them donate what they won’t take because A) I’m not paying to get clothes I no longer want back & B) I’d end up donating them anyway.  ThredUP does all the work of steaming, photographing, etc — to me it’s reasonable they get a bigger cut.  It does take them forever to process a shipment, but again I don’t pay for priority processing as I already am getting a minimal amount for what I’m selling.  I always apply what I get for my sales to purchases to bulk up my own wardrobe, I’ve never had an issue with returns despite the stories others tell.  Overall, the website is better for buying than selling with prices being what you’d pay in a high end consignment boutique, but much more expensive than what you’d pay in a typical thrift store.",5
107,"Quality used clothing, amazing prices, awful shipping: Short and sweet of it, mom of 3 one of which is special needs, who started working in a bank. Needed good work clothes but for them to be affordable. Got it with thred up. I couldn’t have asked for better prices that don’t make me feel guilty about spending money on myself. The quality when it got here surpassed what I could hope for. Way to go thred up for the purchase options you give us. Now the bad. Shipping....horrendous. Made a purchase 2 and a half weeks ago and still waiting to receive it. Who wants to wait almost two weeks for something to ship then track said shipment to have it tell you it will come Friday and never come. Check again says end of day Saturday, never comes. Now says shipment pending but can’t provide a date when it will be delivered. If this was a one time deal I could understand, unfortunately it’s not. Thinking it might be time to pay a little more for an item at my local thrift store rather than wait that long for work clothes. Sorry thred up. Love the prices, love the clothing, but hate the shipping.",3
108,"Worst selling site ever!: I’ve used this site before to buy and sell stuff. I recently sent in a whole big bag full of stuff, clothes and shoes that I no longer wear and I also included kids clothes as well. After taking a month to process my bag and place my items on the site I noticed that a lot of my items were not listed so I wrote customer service to find out why and to see if I could get my items that were not listed returned to me. Customer service wrote back saying that the items that were not listed didn’t meet their strict standards and could not be returned to me! I sent in a pair of Tory Burch heals and some other items as well but yet if you scroll through the site there are items listed with imperfections so i guess maybe the employees get first dibs on the good items but whatever because after selling a few items that they did list and noticing that they were selling the items for like 20-40 dollars a piece and I was only getting a lousy 50 cents HAHA are you kidding me? NEVER AGAIN WILL I SEND MY ITEMS TO THEM! At least with Poshmark you make 80% and you can list your own items! Stay away from this site unless you don’t mind making 50 cents on your items.....especially when they are selling them for 40 dollars! What a rip-off!!!!",1
109,"Customer 6-8 Years: My customer/seller experience has been hot and cold with this company. Last year (August-September) my cart timer switched from 24 hours to 4 hours. I contacted customer service after seeing that some of the items in others carts were in for much longer times. I was told that they were transitioning everyone to 4 hour cart timers. I thought nothing else of it until last week when I clicked on an item in someone’s cart and saw that the item still had 8 hours. WAIT WHAT!?!  I contacted customer service. After several emails back and forth from David first, then Mary, I was told “the fact is this is likely not changing” and that my concerns about a select group having the privilege of extended cart time were noted and passed on. 

The next day I received part of an order. The quality of items listed as “you might think it’s brand new” and “minor wear on fabric” were items that I would not wear. The pilling on a Michael Stars top was horrible.  Ask me for pics! There was also a white spot which at first I thought was fuzz but was something stuck on the top.  This was not the first time the quality was more than a little bit off. 

Customer service is nonexistent at this time. I wonder if it has something to do with the IPO.",1
110,"WORST PLACE EVER TO SELL ITEMS!!!: I have been using ThredUP now for over 10
Years selling and buying! I haven’t had too many issues with buying, but OMGoodness the selling process has gotten down right HORRENDOUS!!! I requested 2 clean out kits back in July 2022, filled and mailed 3 boxes (because they didn’t have anymore bags to send me at the time) and I printed out 3 shipping labels with the ThredUP label supplied to me on each box and mailed out by the first of August 2022! They showed up in transit about a week later and then about two weeks later they showed received August 27th and August 28th 2022! Since then I have sent messages through their website (my app on my iPhone) about 6 times and put my email address and phone number along with my name for someone to contact me and let me know when they show PROCESSING AND THEN READY FOR SALE!!!! I have never gotten any response from anyone!!!! I am totally disgusted and plan on contacting the BBB today to file a complaint against this company for theft of goods!!!",5
111,"Ehhhh: This platform used to be a lot better. Lately items have not been as described, measurements are either missing entirely, I’ve seen pants and tees without them, you never list measurements for jackets/coats/blazers which is ridiculous, or they’re all over the place. If a defect is stated in the description, it’s vague, pictures are so sparse you can’t always see it to decide if you still want the item. You can’t ask additional questions before purchasing, there’s no way in the app to contact customer support directly for help/questions (that I’ve found). It doesn’t update order/return statuses in a timely manner and sometimes not at all. I sent a return 2 weeks ago and there’s been no status updates or communication. No way for me to check when my refund is coming or even confirm you received the return and it’s being processed. I tried looking in “customer support” section to contact someone to ask and it just routes me to FAQ’s. In order to remain competitive in the resale market, additional streamlined functionalities need to be added. People want to know up front what they’re buying so they don’t have to deal with returns.",2
112,"Declining quality of service: I used to love ThredUp, but have noticed a real decline in service the last 8-12 months. First, a clean out bag I returned in Nov. 2021 still hasn’t been processed which means all the clothes in it are now out of season and likely won’t sell. In addition, my last few orders have had major issues. Most recently, two of the three items were mis-sized so the size I got was not the size I ordered. On a previous order, I purchased a dress and pair of shorts. The dress didn’t ship and when I asked why, apparently it was so damaged, they couldn’t justify even sending it to me for free so I could decide if it was salvageable. How did something that damaged even get posted for sale? The shorts came covered in ink stains. Admittedly, they did not charge me, but again, how was something that damaged even listed for sale in the first place? I suspect the damage happened as a result of their handling as there were no stains in the photos of the shorts. If it was ThredUp’s fault, I hope they paid the seller what they would have earned for my purchase. Overall, just very disappointed.",3
113,"Great idea, could be greatly improved: I love the idea of reduce, reuse, recycle. Thrifting is my major contribution to that theme and avoiding fast fashion. ThredUP is a great platform to thrift for clothing and accessories. The app is user friendly, and orders can be made quickly and easily. My complaints: restocking fees add up quickly. Each return costs ~$4 per item, and every order I make ends up with more than 50% of the items going back. It’s a waste of money over time, because most returns are because the minor stains or wear mentioned in captions are not visible in photos (zooming in just gives a grainy pic), but in person are unacceptable. Measurements are inaccurate, so buying something based on that is a crapshoot if it will actually fit. This is my main reason for returns, and it’s frustrating to buy so many items only to return for $4 each. With the inconsistencies, I avoid final sales altogether to avoid non-returnable purchases, and I suggest you do the same. When things go smoothly, this app is wonderful; when they don’t go smoothly, this app is wonderfully disappointing and expensive.",3
114,"Horrible Customer Service - Bundle Ship Disaster, one month late!!!: I ordered some items for a gift and for a trip. I did the whole bundle and save on shipping due to casual gathering items. This ended up causing package to be delayed nearly a month from shipping until I messaged them. They told me they will look into the problem. I asked what can be done since I leave in only 5 days for the trip. I asked them to expedite the shipment instead of bundling but they only have a canned answer. They ended up delaying my shipment by bundling so I didn’t get my packages in time. 

ThredUp is great to search items by fabric but expect Customer Service to do NOTHING if anything goes wrong. They offered free returns but that’s ALREADY AVAILABLE. I’m cutting back on my usage of ThredUP after this experience. Be weary of having to order anything and expecting it to arrive in time. Can’t believe my delivery took over a month and they didn’t offer me any help to actually get my packages before my trip.",5
115,"YESSS— gorgeous cheap clothes, easy returns!: I’ve bought 4 times so far from ThredUP and am complimented constantly on my purchases— try the desktop version too the search engine is better *and* you can sort by price and some other features. Don’t be afraid to return items, shipping really is pre paid for store credit otherwise I think it’s $9 if u want cash back, I always take credit bcs I buy so much from them. The $2 per item restocking fee was annoying until I realized once u buy enough from them u get “points” and I used mine to waive restocking fee and also shipping on a small order. My jeans jacket and striped dress with snakeskin leather boots is killer! And if u care about animal cruelty it makes things nicer to know an animal only died once you’re not making things worse in the world by buying more leather etc. Also I thought it was gross at first but used shoes are amaaaazing, they are broken in so u are much less likely to get blisters. Happy shopping!",5
116,"Read reviews on trustpilot before you sell...: I would rate them 0 stars if I could...I also took the trouble of verifying my email to leave a review on trust pilot just so I can help warn people - that’s how awful my experience was. I kept an eye on how things were being processed and what my payouts were like for the items they decided to list because I was skeptical. Two of the items that were initially marked sold and for which I could see my payouts suddenly became “unavailable” without any explanation. At the end of the day, there is no incentive on their part for transparency. There is no mechanism for sellers to receive items back that thredUP decides not to list, so what’s to say they won’t sell items to a third party and not give you any of the profit? If you’re quite literally looking to throw your clothes in the trash can, thredUP might be a place you turn to; if you want a transparent and fair process, sell through Poshmark or practically any other platform where you have more or a say. Sure, taking pictures and looking up the original cost takes time. But you’re guaranteed to make more money. Also, their “customer service” will keep taking you to canned Q&As. You will never be able to talk to a real person about your grievances.",1
117,Great App!: I have quickly become addicted to ThredUP so much so that I often find myself scrolling through all my favorite brands and favoriting everything I like! I have made several orders and have had only had to return one item so far. Returns were super easy too. I do try to stick to brands that I know I like and that I know what size I am so that way I don’t have to return a lot. I will say though that twice now I have received items that are different brands than what they said they were and both o have paid WAY more for than they would be full price in the store. For example I ordered a pair of Madewell denim shorts but when they came they were actually Universal Thread which is from Target. So I definitely overpaid for those. Another time I ordered what was said to be an Athleta sweatshirt and it actually was a Athletic Works which is from Walmart....I know it’s hard to see in the photos if they in fact did get the brands right or wrong but I think the employees at ThredUP need to be paying more attention to that!,4
118,"Big Fan but they could make some improvements..: I have been shopping on thread up off and on for a few years now- however it is now becoming a daily part of my life to check the app for my saved searches and see if they are having a sale or if my favorite items are still available. I am officially addicted. Fun, good for the plant, great deals. Especially easy if you are an avid shopper that already knows their sizes in the brands they like- although I have also taken some chances and discovered new brands I like. If they really want to take things to true online thrift/consignment store they need to measure more things and expand fabric searches. For example no measurements available for blazers?? You can find items with fabrics like modal, tensel when you shop- but you can’t search for them. So good but at the same time so frustrating. Still a loyal customer though. And highly recommend thred up for online consignment and thrifting. You can get great deals for quality items if you are a savvy shopper.",4
119,"Used to love it: Thredup used to be my number one place to shop, I try to thrift all of my clothing, but the last six or so months almost everything I’ve purchased I’ve had to return for some sort of quality issue.
Two times I’ve purchased North Face jackets listed as womenswear jackets and they arrived as mens - while also clearly says “mens” on the tag. My last purchase, hoping third time was the charm, turned out to be a children’s jacket listed as women’s and had trash in the pockets.
I’ve tried to get a hold of customer service, but they make it terribly difficult to get in direct contact with anyone and I am sent to an automated system every time. With each of these returns I have had to pay a $1.99 return fee because there’s no way to contact anyone even though these errors are made by the company.
Items listed as “ gently used, hardly any signs of wear if any” are showing up with holes and stains. I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control when the prices are only slightly lower than retail on some items anyways.
Aside from clean out kits taking 6 months to process, I haven’t had many issues but I’ve decided to just delete the app and move on.",1
120,"Loyal customer :): In love with this site. I had left the country for a few years and sold just about everything I own when I left and upon my return to the United States.  So I had to rebuy my whole wardrobe, especially when I moved to a different climate area as well.  Having now needing four seasons of clothing, I was able to purchase what I needed for almost 80% off full prices.  My wardrobe is now full and I even have high brand Designer items I would have never been able to afford otherwise. It has help immensely!  I also love the fact I am able to get accessories including purses and shoes which I have also purchased. Everything I have received is in excellent shape, some even still with tags on them. 

I will continue to be a loyal customer!  Best site I have found in a very long time. Easy to use and such a wide selection.  I have even sent clothes for sale on your site, I am excited to see what comes out of it. 

Thank you ThreadUp :)",5
121,"Some clothes were priced above their retail price: I discovered some clothes were priced too much and well above their retail price. Some of them were out of style and yet still overpriced. This site keep claiming the items were priced up to 90% off retail but I strongly disagree. Infant and toddler clothes could be bought for $1-2 a piece at physical thrift stores or new at retail stores on sales for a lot cheaper than what are being sold on Thredup. Like for example, Carter’s store is always on sale and they sell set of 3 brand new onesies for $6, but Thredup is selling just one for $9.99 and it’s used not new. In my opinion Thredup will do far better if they actually priced clothes 90% off their retail price, like the price actual thrift stores are selling, and stop selling out of style dated clothes. They bought out clothes from people literally for nickels and dimes and then price gouged to take the most profit possible. I feel it’s unfair. Plato’s Closet and Clothes Mentor buy clothes from people for several dollars each and still sell much less than Thredup! I would certainly love to shop again if I see actual thrift shop price. I will wait.",3
122,"Good Enough: ThredUP carries a great selection, and I love that they include real measurements of their clothing items so that you have more to go on than just marked sizes, which are so arbitrary these days. However, I have ordered from them several times, and NOT ONCE has my order shown up on time. Literally. Not. A single. Time. And this isn’t like something showing up the day after it was originally scheduled. It’s common for my items to be a week or more late, and rather than adjusting the delivery date ahead of time, they wait until the actual estimated delivery, and then just start pushing it back one day at a time, so you never actually know when you’re going to get your stuff. It’s outrageously frustrating. However, I can live with that if it means shopping in an environmentally friendly way, with higher quality items and a better selection than what I see in most brick and mortar secondhand stores. They just needs to come up with a better delivery date approximation system. It seems every other online company in the universe has accomplished that, so I don’t understand why it’s so hard for thredUP.",3
123,"Almost amazing process: Really great clothes and at some great prices! Returns are made easy with shipping labels and with store credit! Always recommend to family and friends!

My only negative experience was choosing store credit for a return and somehow it processed as complete return with charging me shipping. In the app when a customer makes a return they should have it noted on there what type of return was chosen that way if the wrong click was made or an error occurs that then the customer can even catch it so it helps with a smooth process. On the app it just says the return is processed not what type of return. Very frustrating just because of paying essentially double shipping would not make the return worth it. The in store credit option makes it very worth it cause as a customer you can have piece of mind that if it doesnt fit or looks different than the picture then you can still return and get something else. When the in store credit option works.....I absolutely LOVE the process. That’s the only bad thing about the app is not being transparent. Everything else is really good.",3
124,"Don’t buy or sell with ThredUP. Terrible Price Structures for Buyers & Sellers.: I’ve sent to ThredUP a total of 3 completely filled bags of mid-tier designer brand clothing, mostly worn less than a handful of times to some brand new. This included between 45-50 total pieces from designers ranging from 7 for All Mankind, True Religion, Kate Spade, DKNY, Ralph Lauren and others with sizes ranging from women’s 8 to 10. Items ranged from button up blouses to a cashmere jacket to jeans. I mailed in the bags in June and the only communication I received was a monthly “we’re sorry we are very backed up so your bags will be processed soon.” It was the end of October before all my
items were processed. I could almost forgive the incredibly long lead time but then the full payout structure was presented and, maybe, it was posted in some flowery language with cool graphics—but, WOW. I truly felt the meaning of “pennies on the dollars.” I absolutely understand overhead costs, market pricing, etc. but after selling 30 of the 50 items and what I’m left with is $60…I would have much rather donated this to a local nonprofit. I was not looking to make a ton of money, but I was looking for a more fair and equitable transaction—This whole system feels very one sided.",1
125,"Good luck if you need to talk to customer service: I love the concept of thredUP, I’ve had great luck with the products. I love the way the website is set up. I’ve gotten so many great clothes from them. But  God help you if there’s a glitch in the system and you need to speak with customer service. Chat is useless. they keep trying to give you prompts so they don’t have to actually chat with you, hoping the computer will solve your problem. Email takes forever… I sometimes never receive a response from email and there is no phone number to call. It’s really frustrating as someone who buys a lot from them, it would be nice to be able to get some help when I need it.  
Also, the amount of time that it takes to process and ship an item is crazy. I’ve learned to be patient with it, but I don’t understand why it takes so long. If I weren’t so frustrated with customer service right now, I would give the shipping a pass.",5
126,"Used to be better, suffering growing pains now: B-: This is such a great idea and model for second hand clothing that I hope they will reverse a recent trend to expand at the cost of quality of merchandise, lower payouts for  designer items, and what appears to be computerized customer service, made cutesy with exclamation points and emojis even when a complaint about defective merchandise was submitted. I have sold and bought with them many times over several years and they seem to be having trouble scaling up to a far larger, less organic operation. Somehow the ethos of the second hand market, which they certainly did not invent, seems to be eluding them in this more corporate phase. Fingers crossed that they will not lose their soul and moxie - it’s such a great model and i hope they will find their way back to being less about advertising and promotion and more about the quality of both trading and interpersonal transactions.

Really great way to recycle clothes and to keep up with kids growth and clothe them in great quality items that are out of reach at retail though.",4
127,"it can be frustrating…: I like ThredUP, I do! But some things that would make the experience MUCH better would be… if a clothing item is gently used, the stain, wear, pilling, snag ect should be described or even better, shown. I have been floored at the prices of items that are labeled gently used. Some things can be fixed, some stains can be removed, but if you have no idea what is wrong, you risk getting something that can’t be fixed or hidden/removed. So you can only return it — but you also have to PAY to return a damaged item!! That makes no sense to me. 
I refuse to buy anything unless it’s labeled new with tags or like new. And even some of those items have had holes or a stain. 
That all being said, I have a lot of clothes from brands I could never afford that are good quality and in good condition that I got from ThredUP. It feels like a gamble most of the time tho. I can get brand new clothes on clearance for a better price than some of the used ones for sale here. Show us or at least describe the flaw — and price accordingly!! Then I’d gladly give more stars!",3
128,"Awesome customer service: I love this app it makes shopping so much easier! You can search for clothing and the results will only show you items in your size, I further narrow the filters down to new with tags and like new condition and find such great stuff!

 Another user mentioned receiving something that was advertised to be one size and then when they actually received their item is was clearly not the right size. This happened to me on my first order actually I bought a north face zip up fleece that was advertised to be a women’s XL and it turned out to be children’s sized. I emailed customer service right away, they responded and sent me a label so I could return the item. Once they got it the item back, it took a couple of days but they returned my money. 

The only thing with thredup is the shipping is slow. It takes a while to get your items, and for them to receive any of your consignment items. 

I’ve consigned a few items with them which have all sold. Most of the items I sent them were brand new with tags attached. The listing for one of my items said there was a minor stain which is not true at all because I had never even worn this dress—-but someone still purchased it. You def will not make any money selling your clothes through thredup I’ve sent them 3 bags full of clothes and have maybe earned $13. So if you really need money this is not going to get you much. 

Overall it’s a really cool way to shop and I love using the app.",5
129,"You have to try it to believe it: I never thrift shopped before. Don’t recall how I stumbled upon this site a year ago, decided to try it. Have loved it ever since. Have placed so many orders! 
You can buy things dirt cheap or you can buy expensive things, it’s upto you. 
I’ve completely changed my wardrobe in a year. Have replaced my JCPenney/Macy’s brand clothes with branded clothes (at least I consider them branded🙃), like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Madewell, banana republic, Ann Taylor, White House etc. I get so many compliments at work now, and at home 😄. Best part is, I buy them all super super super cheap and most of them look almost brand new. 
I haven’t bought any clothes from stores/online other than here in a year now. The only things I buy new from other sites are underwear and stockings and shoes. No clothes. 
You have to give it a try even if you have never bought second hand clothes before. You can search by brands and price range. Give it a try!",5
130,"Buying and selling: I just received a dress I purchased for a wedding and it’s perfect.  I was nervous about the measurements being correct as it was a non returnable item.  Thankfully it was spot on. You can’t base the size and measurements off of what the dresses would be brand new. I’m sure some of the formal dresses have been Fitting for the original owner. Will definitely order again.  As far as selling, I was surprised at the amount that I got for my clothes, I thought it would be a little more. But if I threw them away or donated them I wouldn’t have gotten anything back so something is better then nothing. And I wasn’t willing to put in the work to sell the clothing myself on a different site. All in all I like threadup. You’re  able to make some cash back on clothes that you won’t wear again and buy some beautiful dresses without paying an arm and a leg. Even if you have to pay for dry cleaning it’s still cheaper then buying from David’s bridal.",5
131,"Great for buying. Understand before u sell: I have made many purchases from ThredUp for my wear to work corporate wardrobe. I’ve also sold things with a small return. However, I understand the concept.  If those items stay in my house or go in the local give away box they generate no income and something IS better than nothing. Of course, they HAVE to make more than we get. Those beautiful polka dot boxes, bags, wrapping tissue and stickers cost them money. I love those boxes, bags and tissue paper. It always feels like I’m getting a gift. And don’t forget the low standard shipping. No matter how much u order under $79 shipping is $5.99. Thats pretty good. $79 & up is free. After all I don’t have to fight traffic, find parking, walk around with a cart, etc., etc.  ‘‘It’s a great deal even with the low return. Don’t forget, to sell, they send u the bag for free and u return it for free. That cost them too. Don’t like the low return. Then fight traffic, find parking, etc., etc.  still can’t beat the ThredUp way.",5
132,"Horrible site with no customer service: So many problems with Thred Up where do I begin. They offered me a 35% off promotion to entice me to buy again. All items show an amount in red which is the discounted price of 35% off.  Unfortunately when you add to cart to pay the discounted price was way more than they themselves state in the listings. First contact to customer service I am told they have a maximum discount.  I show them the offer details from their own app and nowhere is maximum discount mentioned. Customer service rep blew me off.  Tried to purchase another item and same issue-discount price did not match price in cart. Reached out to customer service again with pics showing discrepancies and they didn’t even bother to acknowledge my message or my request for a person higher up in the company to address this.  Lastly, would have purchased a third item but they allow people to put items on their cart for weeks on end and their timer as to when it expires from their cart is not accurate so I cannot ever purchase the item because someone just repeatedly puts it back in their cart.  I intend to proceed with a complaint to BBB as I believe their business practices are negligent at best and deceptive at worst.",1
133,DO NOT SEND IN ITEMS!!!!: This is my second time turning in clothes and the first time I had 3 like new Michael Kors bags that they sold for close to 250$ each which we didn’t even buy for that much so they over priced them and they were used so they should have been 100$ max. I feel awful that I even supported them a second time after knowing they were ripping people off. I also sent a full bag of clothes with those 3 bags and I think I got 40$ back. While they made a easy 400$ off me. My second time was even worse. A bag stuffed full with items that were gently used some had tags still and even brand new boots. And they old got listed to sell and It says I would be making only close to 10$ dollars back. But the real kicker is that they didn’t even give me the 10$ to spend. Basically at this point I’m giving this company free clothes to sell and they give me what a 2% tip. Also beware I heard people say they aren’t truly donating the clothes to people in need but putting them in “Goody” boxes to sell for...you guessed it more cash in their pockets. It’s a greedy company and awful business practice. Donate to a local shelter instead or list online. Customer service is also a complete joke and will not contact me back.,1
134,"Happy: I never shop retail. Never. All my life I’ve bought second hand because I could always find what I needed within my budget and get much better quality than I could otherwise afford. I detest malls. Retail stores make me feel physically ill. Literally. Ever since I was a little girl. I hated having to go shopping with my mom because going in those stores made me feel bad. Then the pandemic came along. I could get everything I truly needed, like groceries, delivered, by friends or stores. But no more browsing the Goodwill. Then I found ThredUP. I can truly say that by being patient I have, over the course of the last year, found everything I was specifically looking for through ThredUP. I just start a search for what I’m looking for and sooner or later it shows up. The prices are very good. When I have questions I chat or email. My questions are answered promptly. Returns are easy and credited in a reasonable time frame. I am happy 😊.",5
135,"They will lie, steal and ignore you: I’ve literally caught them in a lie and they tried to place the blame on processing errors - which would still be an issue for another person if it were true, and still theft! 
I sent in several bags and it took forever to get them processed. I complained and asked for my bags back, to not even bother listing anything because this was beyond the time stated when I sent my stuff in. They complied and said they would. Somehow a bag managed to be listed? Anyway about 75% of items were accepted. however, I noticed a week after this bag was listed, three new items I had sent in that were not originally listed as accepted, were now sold under my closet, but I’m not getting the credit if they are sold. I’ve been trying to get them to acknowledge these items, but the are just ignoring me, and saying these items could just be another persons items. They’re not. They’re mine. And if that’s another issue that also happens, this is all around fraudulent activity and they are straight up stealing. Who knows what actually happens to the other items they say aren’t accepted but are just fine. Do not do any consignment with these thieves.",1
136,"LIFE CHANGING!: Finally!! Someone had the brains to tap into the world of youthful, stylish plus size women. We do not need to look like your frumpy grandma! We now have one place to go to buy affordable clothing with the same options of our slimmer peers, and all from the privacy of our home. We no longer have to deal with the stigma and discrimination of being plus size in a retail world that won’t acknowledge or respect us as viable customers. There are some extra fees involved in regards to the restocking and returning, but it is better than the frustration of scouring your town for clothing in your size only to be forced to buy ugly clothes just because they are the only thing you can find in your size. I am hooked on this site, and have had a minuscule return rate compared to the cool clothing, accessories, and outward that I have scored for 1/4 or less than I would have paid retail (that is IF I ever was able to find them.). Thank you ThredUP! I am a huge fan!",5
137,"Absolutely love ThredUp: They have a great selection of clothes, and I love the option to filter products by color, condition, FABRIC, cut, etc. They even share the measurements of pants (waist width, rise), so you can take the guesswork out of ordering pants. (Sizes even within a single brand vary so much!) So many filtering options and regular sales!!💸I save my searches and favorites and wait until sales pop up. I’m a power (bargain) user!

I generally love the app too. Quick return processing capabilities and rewards tracking. I’ve had a couple issues with App and customer service. Overall CS had taken care of me quickly and always rectified issues, but I’ve had a bit t of run around getting them to address a specific issue (maybe they were just sending irrelevant auto responses at first) The app is great, but I’m unable to view order tracking recently. In the past, order tracking was visible within the app.

THRED UP FOR MEN would be soo cool!",5
138,"Disappointed: I used to love thred up. UntiI purchased an expensive  pair of boots that were listed as returnable. They didn’t fit. When I went to return them they were listed as non-returnable.  I emailed multiple times and received no reply. I would not have taken the chance if I thought I couldn’t return them. I have bought other things that were not returnable that I didn’t like so I had learned that lesson already. I have sold a few things in the past through them, though the reimbursement is laughable. And I have tried to communicate with this company previously over other issues as well and never received a response. There is no way to communicate with them. I don’t like to leave bad reviews but if you don’t have enough time or staff to respond to emails and don’t have any other way to communicate, you likely are in over your head  or in the wrong business and should find a way to change that. You leave me no option but to leave a bad review. I will not buy anything else and definitely will not sell anything else on this site despite having credit there from previous sales. There are so many better options out there. I’m done.",1
139,"Great quality, great prices: I've really enjoyed my experiences as a buyer with the ThredUP app so far. Easy to navigate through and search for items with filters. The prices and quality of the items I've bought have been awesome! I did have to return a couple items due to sizing issues, but returning them was a breeze through the app. The returns took awhile to complete but that was solely on the delivering process of the packages. Once my returned items were received, it only took 3 days for ThredUP to process my return (which they clearly state on their FAQ page). 

Some improvement in the app would be to enable a way to filter for ""My Size"" automatically once you click on ""Shop Similar"" with favorite items that are in someone else's cart or that have sold. Also, it would be nice to easily request to be notified if an item you like that was in someone else's cart becomes available again. This is a feature on the website but not on the app. Overall, I highly recommend the app and will frequently be returning.",4
140,"recent update is okay: I love thredup as a shopping site. I’ve only placed one order so far but was super happy with it and plan to order more. The app used to be kind of glitchy (would freeze on item pages; exiting and returning to app would temporarily fix problem) but so far the recent update seems to have improved in that. However, I HATE the way the pages scroll on the new update. The page doesn’t scroll smoothly anymore, it’s kind of jerky and not optimal for slowly browsing as you scroll continuously. I can’t figure out exactly what’s different with it, I think they changed something about the pop-up menu bars or maybe just the scroll sensitivity. It’s annoying but not enough to make me stop using the app. On the bright side, with the new update the search function and item suggestions seem to have improved, which is awesome. 5/5 for ThredUp, 4/5 for the latest update (fix the scrolling!).",5
141,"UNSANITARY: This was my second time purchasing from ThredUP. They always have good discount sales & this time I bought a good amount of clothes. The first problem was the tracking of the order. It estimated the delivery incorrectly about 3-4 times within a week. It didn’t update the tracking often nor correctly, but it took a little over a week to arrive which is fine.

The second & BIGGEST issue was the fact that I found a blonde hair attached to one of my clothing items. I thought at first that maybe a worker at the warehouse’s strand of hair may have fallen on it but I noticed it had a stench to it. Like it came from someone else’s home smell. All of them did. I washed all of my clothes and as I check the pockets, one of my skirts had a disgusting used toilet paper scrunched up inside a pocket. I was extremely disgusted and disappointed to realize that ThredUP does NOT clean, sanitize, inspect the clothes they’re selling. If you’re going to sell second hand and encourage environmental friendly shopping, at least do it with care in order to keep your costumers.",3
142,"Horrible customer service and: I have been buying from this site for about 1 1/2 now and I was only buying new with tags items at first but figured I’d try the like new selection. I’m very disappointed! They send you items that are stained, have holes etc. definitely not in excellent condition like they claim! Then after contacting customer service they told me that sometimes things get sent back or have been in a warehouse to long so they come with flaws. They will send things that are the wrong size as well and they did give refunds but now say they cannot offer refunds even though the items came in poor condition or not even the size listed. They want you to print the label if they make you send back for a refund but I don’t have a printer so I drive across town to use one from the library and pay to print! I just think they need to really change their policies and so I will be shopping on Poshmark and Mercari! Stay away from this site! They will hook you and then scam you! I really wish I would have read the reviews before using this site! I honestly wouldn’t even care if they offered store credit but it’s better than being left with junk clothes that you wasted your money buying!",1
143,"Best place to shop ever!!: I love thred up so much. An old friend of mine told me about it and I was instantly hooked the moment I signed up! I always felt guilty about buying fast fashion and the thrift stores around my place don’t have that much cute stuff. So it makes me extremely happy that I’m buying second hand clothing for super cheap prices without contributing to child labor or climate issues!!(and all the clothes are super cute and trendy!) They have real designer brands for half the price! And you’re not ruining our home planet for wanting to feel good in a cute outfit! Amen! It’s extremely easy to buy from thred up too and I NEVER have any problems. I’ve been using it for 2 years now and have the cutest clothes from free people and other brands that I would normally feel guilty for buying!!! Get thred up and wear the cutest outfits while feeling good about helping our climate!!! <33 you deserve it! Whoever is reading this, I hope you have a blessed day! Muah!",5
144,"Good Company: They seem to be a good company. Been shopping and selling/donating for a while. Not everything is perfect- some items get mislabeled (sometimes it looks like human error but sometimes I wonder if it’s faulty algorithms?), and sometimes the customer service department gets overwhelmed and takes longer than I’m used to. Some info available on the app isn’t available on the site and vice versa. But I’ve never had a true problem with them. They’re not as big/efficient as the multi-national retailers, but they really do seem to be hustling. When they get back to me they’re always informed, courteous, and fair- without exception. I’m reliably able to find quality pieces at a price point I’m comfortable paying (so long as it doesn’t rise) with plenty of decent shipping/receiving options. And most importantly I prevent adding untold tons of new waste and pollution to the planet, and I support an economic/humanitarian alternative to consumer fashion that is home-grown, well-designed, and fun to use.",5
145,"Pay close attention: First time using Thred UP, my kid grew in the quarantine, busting the seams in more than one pair of the favorite skinny jeans. Since we can’t exactly go shopping, I hoped this app would be a good way to get new clothes without going out and shopping. We took the measurements and filtered the search for the waist size we needed. Chose three pairs of skinny jeans that looked perfect, and ordered them. Spent $63 in total. One pair was final sale, but I was sure they were going to fit, so no problem. Then they arrived. One pair was way too big, even loose on me, and I’m a good 25 lbs. heavier. Of course, those are the ones we can’t return. The other two were way too small. How did the same search get so much difference?  

Looking closer at the descriptions of the jeans, the main description says 34” waist on two, and size medium on the other. Down below, you can find more measurements, and two said the waist measurements were 28” and the other was 44”. Wow, not exactly a size 34” waist as I searched for. So now I’m out $25 before the shipping costs. I don’t exactly trust the site now, probably won’t be back. Seems like a good idea, but was not executed well in this instance.",2
146,"Good for the wallet, environment, & closet: I have been a loyal thredUP shopper and seller since I discovered them in 2015. If you shop at thredUP, your shopping will be both good for the environment and for you and your wallet. If you have never discovered the magic shopping secondhand, thredUP is a great first place to try. They are a great place to build a sustainably chic wardrobe for you and your kids.

thredUP is the world’s largest online consignment and thrift store that buys and sells women’s and kids’ secondhand clothes. Shopping online with them feels like shopping at a department store website. They carry over 25,000 designer, department store, and mall store brands. New items are added daily. They even carry new with tags items.

Shopping online at thredUP feels like a treasure hunt to me. With some patience, and with good use of their filters, I am always able to find items I love from my favorite brands. A polka dot box filled with great finds is just few clicks away.",5
147,"Beta search is ruining this app: I have saved searches for specific fabric types (surprise! Fabric content is important to me!). When you filter a search by material, there is no option for hemp, organic cotton, modal or bamboo… which should be corrected, but until now, I’ve gotten by just fine searching “hemp” or “bamboo” and getting just what I’m looking for. With Beta search, all “hemp” finds me now is things with weed plants on them, green clothing and 13k other pieces of clothing that have ZERO to do with hemp materials. 

The strange thing is, I keep getting notifications that my searches are finding the correct things and I’m getting emails and notifications for the correct clothing items. If I click the notification, it takes me to the beta search which isn’t what it showed in the notification. The only way I’m able to find what I need is to click each individual item from the email I only get once per day. 

I hope this beta search thing is corrected. If not, maybe more material options added to the filter? I guarantee I’m not the only person who is looking for these types of clothing.",2
148,"Encroaching on scam territory: I have used thread up for quite a while now as a seller and a buyer. From a buyer perspective, out of the 9 orders I’ve placed, there has been issues with every single one. Condition was wrong, measurements were wrong, and some items came damaged. Like one shirt I ordered had a large hole in it. Another shirt I ordered looked like it was going to disintegrate. Among other issues. I really wanted to like thread up, but have not had a single good experience. 

From a seller stand point, my biggest complaint is the dishonesty. They say that they donate your clothes if they don’t sell, but not before they try to sell them and pocket the money on their own. The first time I noticed this was with a j crew sweater and a Armani sweater I was going to reclaim. I missed the window, but low and behold - my items were for sale, just not from my closet. Same exact pictures and all. And no, this wasn’t a coincidence. Neither of these were common. And like I said, they used the same pictures. I have screen shots. Not to mention, it takes forever to have your stuff processed and the money isn’t worth it. You will get much more money from just about any other app.",1
149,"I ❤️ ThredUP!: Yes, it’s an online consignment and thrift store. But wait . . ￼. It’s so much more than that. It’s like going to the mall where you find all your favorites like Talbots, Chico’s, J. Crew, White House Black Market, Nordstrom, Alfani, Kate Spade, Coach, etc.  No wasted gas money, no problems parking, no distractions from Cinnabon, and no time wasted searching through clothes that are the wrong style or size. 

You can easily sort and set your search parameters by size, condition, color, brand, etc. Personally, I choose “new with tags” under condition. They have lots of brand new inventory!  Retail has had a difficult time recently and I’m finding some amazing classic pieces to add to my closet. 

If you’ve lost or gained weight, I understand it’s expensive to purchase a new wardrobe. Maybe you are working and really need some new black slacks, but money is tight. They cover shipping with a minimum order size and that minimum drops the more you order. Returns are easy.",5
150,"Clean outs: First clean out box is not a good experience. They took the one slightly used pair of shoes and posted them for sale and told me that all the new pairs of shoes that were in the box we’re not in condition to sell even though it was clear that those items were never used or worn . After contacting customer service this issue was never resolved and $500 worth of shoes that were in this box. I was paid out nothing disappointing experience. Also, there was over 50 articles of clothing with tags on it that had never been worn and they just totally disappeared from my clean out and never got paid for them. I highly suggest you do not use this service. It was greatly disappointing and they kept most of my belongings without paying me out even though it stated they would pay you out immediately for certain items and it never happened then to add insult to injury they charge you $.25 to pay you she doesn’t make any sense and they want to charge you shipping but yet they don’t give you anything for your items that sold I made more money on yearly garage sales than I did with this company. I keep emailing company I’m ignored.",1
151,"Excellent quality n service: I have been surfing this app for years n didn’t order till recently.  My first purchase I spent $250 n that included 23 pairs of jeans, 11 shirts, n a jacket n I didn’t pay more then $10 for an item other then the jacket. Everything arrived early or on time, sizing was perfect, n was as pictured on the app except for 1 pair of jeans n that was my own fault for not paying closer attention before adding them to my cart.  I’m a big fan of Hollister, Abercrombie, n American eagle n the quality of the jeans I chose is just like walking out of one of these stores with a brand new pair. Only difference I paid 85% less then retail price but just as happy.  Everyone at threads up does an amazing job selecting their products n I will definitely be ordering more soon, not just for myself but my family as well.  I’m a mom of 5 kids from teenager to infant so pricing is a big thing for me but u all did great n will have years of business to come from me!  Thank u everyone!",5
152,"Great app, needs a couple updates: I have been shopping ThredUP since they came on the scene and have been loyal ever since. I love the quick loading images that help me search through many items quickly. I like the front and back photos. One thing that I’m missing is the close up details. One photo looks like a normal t-shirt and then when I received it, it’s ribbed and not at all what I thought I bought. Another time I bought chino pants. When I received them they had all-over embroidery that is not an appealing style for me. A written description of the item would help eliminate these faux pas. I’m also very particular about what types of fabric my skin can tolerate. Not knowing if something is 100% cotton or a cotton blend is important to me. I will keep wading through the weeds of second hand clothing because it’s important to our environment. I am truly grateful you provide this service at all. If you open a warehouse on the west coast, I think I would be a passionate worker. Thank you!",4
153,"Use Poshmark instead: I understand this app is trying to steer people away from fast fashion and I can respect that. However, they are ripping people off in the process. I sent 54 very lightly used and brand new items to be sorted. They accepted 13 of them, 4 of those being single items from sweatsuits, which broke up the sets. It seems weird to me that they don’t sell tracksuits as a single item and worse that they wouldn’t just take both items from a set. They sent back the rest of the items, at my expense, which was fine. I wasn’t paid more than 65 cents for any single item. Most were not especially high dollar items, (mostly Old Navy and Carter’s) but some were Patagonia, Columbia, etc. I ended up owing them money ($15) even after getting a payout because of shipping fees. They on the other hand made $157 off my 13 items. I PAID them to earn money on perfectly good clothes that I could have donated to needy people for free. Instead I just felt bitter and made the choice to either donate my low dollar items in the future, even if they are in perfect/great condition and sell my high dollar items on Poshmark where I won’t take a loss.",1
154,"Super scammy: It is so scammy for selling. They list all your new with tags merchandise as used and you have to try and get ahold of them 10x to change it and many times they still don’t. They list your merchandise at the lowest price hoping you’ll miss the “12 hr window” to change prices and most of the time they do it at 2am so you're sleeping during most of the “window”. They want you to miss the window so they can buy your good stuff super low and resell. Their customer chat is rarely open and not on days it claims to be, and they don’t have phone customer service and the email customer service never gets back to you. Their chat is either foreign or super illiterate so they can’t follow anyways.  They change their payout structures all the time and have changed them without warning. They do sales that come out of your pay without warning.  They don’t value their sellers nor the good quality merch they bring in. Lots of colors of shade! You will sweat bullets while you can’t get ahold of anyone to help you after they just listed a “New with tags” J.Crew coat original price $398- “used for $48”... I don’t wish this on anyone. I’d have given them 0 stars if possible, they are shady and dishonest.",1
155,"Great concept but room for improvement: I love thred up generally speaking. I hate going shopping so it’s great to be able to shop online and feel good about buying second hand. I’ve found some great pieces that I never would have bought retail. However, I’ve tried several goody boxes which were all a bust. The most recent one I tried was a “box of favorites” and I requested that they include the items in my cart, which they did not. Apparently there’s a “choose your own” box on the website that is not available on the app. I wish they had read my request (I thought that’s what that section was for...?) and contacted me if they couldn’t fulfill it. It seems like they may be understaffed because it can be difficult to get questions answered and I often find myself feeling confused. But other than that, I love that they are helping the environment and I love that I can refresh my wardrobe without leaving the house.",5
156,"This app has helped me reign in bad shopping habits. Love it!: I’ve struggled for a while trying to reduce waste in all aspects of life, and fashion was a really tough one. It’s hard not to buy new stuff all the time when tastes and trends change. I LOVE how this app has totally changed my buying habits! I no longer jump at low-quality “good deals” at the mall, because I know I can find a better quality version on thredup for the same price. I love that’s textiles aren’t being wasted on my impulse purchases. And the app itself and the service are way ahead of other secondhand online retailers. The saved search and notification feature have helped me find some items that I never would have been able to afford new. Returns are easy, selling on the platform is easy, and I love the options for app/notification customization. I’ve become a bit of a thredup evangelist among friends. Thanks for making such a great service and app!",5
157,"Thanks ThredUP: I love ThredUP.  The selection is great, I received what I ordered and in a timely period.  Today I tried to log in to order some more items and they said my password was wrong.  I tried several times and sent an message.  I went into my account screen on my app and changed my password then tried to sign on on my computer.  I received the link they sent, clicked on it and it didn’t do anything.  I tried this several times and none of them worked.  I would much rather have the opportunity to view and purchase on my laptop instead of my phone.  It really was annoying trying to get it fixed and so far it isn’t working on the computer
************************************************
I have to change my 2 star rating.....   I immediately received an email from the developer regarding my issues.  I didn’t expect to hear back from anyone let alone as quickly as I did.  I was really impressed and if I could give more than 5 stars I would",5
158,"Measurements are misleading to say the least!!!: I am 6 feet tall and 128 pounds. So when shopping for jeans, I always need to know the waist measurement along with the inseam. I have tried several times looking for flare jeans on this site. So, I put that in the search filter and it never gives me any flare jeans. Instead, it brings up all skinny or straight leg jeans. Where do they do that at? 

I have made several purchases with this company, which usually consist of at least 12 items or more in a package. I know that four out of five pairs of jeans I got on my last purchase were of no use to me. And what do you know they were non-refundable. If you are able to return the item, you have to pay the restocking fee and that alone is ridiculous in itself. After reading all the reviews from other customers, I will no longer make any more purchases from this app. Bad clothes and bad business. Shame, shame, shame!!!!",5
159,"Tiring and somewhat deceptive: I used to enjoy finding items on your site but now you pull things off after 1 hour, it’s very frustrating because you can’t enjoy looking for more items when things are disappearing.  Several times I’ve been offered a special “promo discount” so I’ve logged on to shop, only to find out it didn’t apply.  Such as this time up to 50% off, none of the 5 items I bought had a discount.  In recent past attempts I left the cart.  
When ThredUP used to have discount offers, it was across the board, it was black and white. Now there is this big gray area. I feel like I have to work to hard now and read very carefully if the item I’m looking at has any discount offer, then I have to watch the time and rush back to save items in order to check out.
I realize you added re-stocking charges to items a couple years ago, but the disappointments are building.",5
160,Amazing unique finds!: ThredUP has an amazing variety of all kinds of clothing purses belts shoes and much more. I have been shopping on thredUP since last year when I lost a lot of weight and I needed a lot of new clothes for work and for leisure. Their customer service is amazing I receive all of my items within a week normally. You can choose the type of clothing and what condition their in from with tags to gently worn. I have had very little issue returning clothes that didn’t fit or that weren’t standard for me. I have received so many compliments on all of my really cool ThredUP finds. I have also bought all kinds of things that I couldn’t afford normally and that I would not be able to find locally. If you’re looking to sell it’s a little different story because you’re not going to make a ton of money from your items right away it’s going to take them a while to process them and list them.,5
161,"Several items not as described: I have made several orders from Thred-Up. At first, I loved it and told everyone they needed to try it. But since receiving and actually getting to use several of my purchased items, I found that 1 item described as a size 14 or 16 is at least 20+ size. The size tag was missing, so someone obviously guessed and was WAY off. Unfortunately, I did not return the dress in time - so I am stuck with it. I purchased a very expensive pair of high-end shoes described as “like new.” When I wore them for the first time, to my mother-in-law’s funeral, the bottom of the heel came off one shoe as we walked down the church aisle to our seats and the sharp pieces left on the bottom of the shoe stuck continuously to the carpet. Terrible!! $90 used shoes - that I now have to find a cobbler for to see if I can repair them. I also purchased a small coach purse described as like new. It arrived with fabric pilling - did NOT look like new. I received several nice items, too - but for what I spent...I could have purchased the nice items new. Just beware and send the stuff back ASAP if it isn’t right.",3
162,"Great for women, not so much for kids, not at all for men: Loving the women’s clothes!  Terrific condition and price.  Buyer beware though - sizing is accurate about 70% of the time.  Not stoked on the return policy considering the clothing description sizing inaccuracies are the only reason I’ve wanted to return anything.  

Tons of trouble sorting through boys clothes. Toddler and youth sizes not differentiated on a great deal of the items, what appears to be girls clothes mixed in with boys, little to no description of items (especially sizing - inseam and such) and the pricing isn’t what I expected considering what kids do to clothes.  They look like they’re in great condition but I’ve had a heck of a time finding the correct sizes for a price I’m willing to pay for clothes that will only be used for 6 months to a year.  Could you please invest in male mannequins?  I might be mistaking male clothes for female based on the shape of the mannequin they’re displayed on.

Why are there no men’s clothes??  Nothing for my husband and, I can’t shop here for my older teenage sons based on their size either :(",3
163,"Accuracy has decreased: Over the years I have consistently bought many items from ThredUp and over the years I've downgraded my ratings because their quality assurance has decreased. You can't trust the measurements for a lot of clothing items anymore, esp. the pants for women. Now they have changed the ""like new"" items to possibly have a light stain or slight imperfection on it but I've found that to be inaccurate and some of the items have had holes or major stains on it, so if you want to be in the safe side, only pick items that are new with tags on it. The hassle of sending clothes back is annoying, esp. if you don't have a printer because they require you to print a label and stick it inside the package. The points system isn't that great, you can never combine codes and I think they should improve their shipping policies but given the track record it's probably just going to get worse. For now, I  still think it's a good site to buy used clothes but you really have to be aware of these key issues.",3
164,"Love it! Quality. Prices. Customer Service.: I just made my 2nd purchase with ThredUp. My 1st purchase shipped in 3 packages (all coming from different locations), but the first arrived in less than a week! Even better, the products looked brand new! I placed my 2nd order with them for Black Friday, and chose the “Bundle & Buy” option (if you don’t know what it is, do yourself a favor and check it out! It saves you money on shipping & saves the environment a little extra packaging product)! I clearly didn’t understand how the process worked at first, because I unknowingly made the purchase without adding the Black Friday promotional codes to save. I contacted Customer Service through the Chat option, and within 15 minutes I had a resolution. (They weren’t able to go back and add the holiday pricing, but they did give me a one-time discount to apply to the order to help recoup the lost savings)! I’ve already ordered my clean-out kit too! Overall, fantastic app!",5
165,"Needs improvement.: I have used ThredUP a couple of times now.   Unfortunately, I’ve ended up returning 1/2 of my purchases due to fit or lack of quality.   In my opinion, the listings for a clothing item should have measurements of the item as a requirement. Sometimes, I’m one size in on label and another size in another label.   Measurements of the item are the only true way to determine fit.   Also, I’ve bought 2 sheer dresses that I’m sure originally had a built in slip when sold, and yet when purchased on ThredUP, there’s no slip rendering the item essentially unwearable.   Finally, it would be nice to have the option to ask a question about an item prior to purchasing.   This would help in determining if it’s the right item for you, and save on returns.   Oh and I’m dismayed by the timeframe to send in clothes for sale.   I realize during the pandemic a lot of people are clearing out their closets but there’s also a lot of people that need jobs.   Please hire more people so you can process items for sale sooner than 8 weeks.",3
166,"Loving the hunt!: I am almost to triple digits in items I’ve ordered. Some have been items I could never afford new. They have garnered many compliments, the condition and quality being visible, even to the uninitiated. I knew from the get-go that sizing differs from country to country, between manufacturers, from designer to designer, and sometimes item to item. I liked that I could return items that would have been too financially risky to order otherwise. I have returned a few things, some too small - so I learned that designer’s sizing. I returned something because it clearly photographed better than it appears. No problems with the returns. It would have cost me more in time and travel, to have shopped brick and mortar to try the items on. So the restocking fee is completely reasonable. Best of all, there’s an incredible range of items; thrifting at its best. 

I also clean out through ThredUP. Icing on the cake - a large audience so pieces can find new use. 

LOVE ThredUP!",5
167,"Be careful: I have been shopping on this site for a little over a year, so, many, amazing, finds. HOWEVER…. There are numerous items I purchased as “brand new, no wear if any” and once received discover they have holes in them. I end up throwing it out instead of bothering returning it. Yes, I have contacted customer service and received money back on some occasions. Their customer service is great. I have recently sent in items to sell and this is where I lost all trust and likely won’t shop again. I sent in a pair of Uggs to sell that were never worn, they never appeared on the site, I contacted customer service and was told “they were passed up on”. I am convinced they were taken by one of the employees. ThredUP sells uggs that look like they are falling apart so it baffles me that mine which were unworn were passed up on. Also if you don’t have a PayPal account you cannot cash out on your sold items. I do not and will not have a PayPal because my account was hacked so I am forced to use my sold items as credit instead of cashing out. Moral of the story ASSUME that what you are buying has holes in it.",2
168,"Still haven’t received my items: I would give another star for the selection of items. Browsing this app is quite addicting for the thrifty shopper. However, I placed an order for an Urban Outfitters top and some Lululemon leggings for $60. I understand that this is considered a steal for these labels, but I placed this order on 3/22, didn’t receive an order confirmation for at least a week, and am finding that they will arrive on 4/10. Again, super happy to get such awesome labels at a great price, but for the amount of time I’ve been waiting for the packages I feel that I should have paid much less.

UPDATE: received the lululemons. I am absolutely disappointed. I’ve worked in resale, so I know for a fact that lululemons ALWAYS have a size label inside the pockets of their products. I received the leggings (the app said they were an 8) checked the inside pocket and noticed they were a size 10. I paid $50 for these and cannot find a single customer service number. At this point I would like a return but as the other reviews have stated, the customer service department seems to be lacking for this business. I would be less upset if I didn’t have to wait a month for my order.",1
169,"Addicted: I recently lost quite a bit of weight. I didn’t want to buy a bunch of new clothes, knowing the cost would be astronomical.  I started browsing thread up and thought I would try it out. I bought a skirt and 2 tops and 2 purses.  I was definitely skeptical at first, but I must say I am pleasantly surprised. Everything fit perfect and was like brand new. There’s so many brands to choose from and different price points. They also have amazing sales.  My only concern is my own spending habits.  Every night I see some thing I want, and I put it in my favorites keeping an eye ion it. The only feedback I really have for *thread up is more pictures of the pieces. I often find myself skimming over things because there’s not enough variations for me to look at to assess if it’s something I really want to purchase.  Especially on a higher priced items such namebrand, purses, and closing. Otherwise I’m sold.",5
170,"Big fan, although it’s not as cool as a few years ago: ThredUP is my main place to shop for clothes for a good few years now. I mostly buy high end items, so the savings are significant; and if you shop for regular brands like Gap or Old Navy, you can get a full wardrobe update for literally just a few bucks. They have a great selection of kids clothes as well. You do need to dig through a lot, and I mean A LOT to find something really great, but if you do 1-2 wardrobe updates a year, it’s not that annoying. In my personal opinion, they used to have more interesting (aka one of a kind) options a few years back than they do now, but it’s still pretty good. They recently doubled their fees - shipping and return fees - which is not pleasant but I guess after Covid every business does whatever it takes to survive. All in all, I still do highly recommend checking ThredUP out if you haven’t yet.",5
171,"Good deals!: I’ve been using thredUP for probably two years. I like that I can find good deals without having to spend hours and hours at a thrift store picking out the good stuff. It’s super convenient. But you do have to pay for the convenience because it is not nearly as cheap as the thrift store. 

Next, I wish that they gave a little bit more information in the descriptions of the items... for example, I brought a dress that looked like it had some amazing embroidery, but when I got it, I realized it’s just paint. It would’ve been nice if the description may have said something so that I could figure that out before I bought it. Lately I have been trying to find some Velvet things. The description almost never mentions the word Velvet. It may tell you the contents of the fibers, (polyester, cotton, viscose, etc.) but that’s not very helpful in determining if the picture I see is velvet or velour or maybe just shiny fabric.

but other than that it’s great",5
172,"I love thredUP!: I love thredUP! Always have. I discovered this online thrift store when I was in seventh grade, about 10 years ago. I have been a frequent shopper ever since. At the time, a lot of my classmates were wearing Victoria’s Secret pink, I lived in a small town, and getting to a mall wasn’t easy. I also had the budget of my own money, and not my parents. I used to get all of my PINK from thredUP and nobody would know because Their quality is always amazing. And if it’s not, they will reach out to you and let you know that they found something that they previously didn’t notice. My last purchase, they found a minor error on two of my items, and gave me a refund for those items, and still sent me the items! They came in the mail, and I couldn’t find anything wrong with them! I still look up an item on thredUP that’s namebrand, before I ever go to the own brands website. Life hack! Ha ha.",5
173,"App is fine.  The business itself - not so good: Been shopping from this app for a couple of years now, and have watched it become a victim of its own success. Selling is now a complete nightmare- per ThredUP I have sent in clothes suitable for the next quarter’s season. Yet of the 2 bags of spring offerings I sent back in March, we are now in mid July and only 1 bag has even been processed. No estimated processing date on the other and summer will be over soon - which cuts even further to the pathetic payout I hope to receive. (This will be my last attempt to sell thru this company). Also, keep in mind that for every item you order and return, even if it arrives showing damage or not as described (for example a lovely dress I bought came CLEARLY marked as maternity and I’m definitely not expecting …) is subject to about a $4 fee PER ITEM. I have found it to be less costly to shop sale items now at macys, Marshall’s, Kohl’s than to buy USED clothes from ThredUP But the app itself works as expected. Easy to navigate and use to initiate orders and returns. And believe me, shoppers will have many, many returns and will pay a hefty price to do so.",1
174,"My go-to shop!: Lots to love about the app. It functions well and is very efficient. I like that carts have a time-limit. My favorites is quickly updated with available merchandise. You have made some good changes recently.
 But I do have suggestions on making it better. Filters work great, but a “don’t show” option would be good. For example, “don’t show off-the-shoulder tops”. 
 In descriptions, more measurements would be helpful. Also It would also be helpful if mannequins sizes or measurements were given. The picture of measurements are helpful but knowing how it sits on the mannequin would help even more.
Also in descriptions, pictures of insides/bottoms of shoes would be helpful. Inside of purses also. I do like the purse on the mannequin picture. Also in descriptions, a picture of what is considered a stain or minor wear would be helpful. 
Keep up the good work. These days I only “shop” in stores to find my sizes for a brand and then go buy on Thred Up!",4
175,"Questionable buying practices: I used to love ThredUP for both buying and selling but am deleting the app today. In the past, I was able to send in items and get a flat payout. I sent a box off earlier this year and it took literally 6 months before they were able to sort it, I nearly forgot about it. Then, it was all under consignment which I normally wouldn’t mind but they ONLY gave most of my items 7 days to sell before they’d “recycle” them or I had to pay to get them back. And the items were ranked different. So I could pay $10 for my lower 10 items sent back as they all expired on the same day but then 3 weeks later for my two longer term items I had to pay ANOTHER $10 just to ship those back. Not to mention whatever happened to the other items I sent that weren’t ever listed. I’m done with them altogether. Continue to shop with them if you must but absolutely do not send them any of your clothes. I have doubts they are “recycling” any of my perfectly in style and newer condition clothes.  I was a manager for a Plato’s in a past life, I have some experience on this type of resale model.",1
176,"Used to have better deals: I originally got a thredUP account a few years ago, and the app was much better both for buyers and sellers then. Now, items are more expensive AND subject to a $2 restocking fee if you buy something and want to return it. In addition, there’s a lot of inconsistency with categorization and description of items— items are constantly being put in the wrong category (I.e. something will be labeled as a coat when it’s a dress, a wool coat when it’s made of cotton, or a “brand new with tags” bathing suit when there’s a hole in it). Plus, for sellers, the “payout” is a joke. I didn’t realize until *after* I had sent in my 4 clean out kits that 1) I would only get paid for the items if they sell and 2) these items had to sell within 60 days or I wouldn’t get paid at all. 
I do like the app, I love the concept of it, and I love how much stuff there is to sift through! It’s lots of fun, but they definitely need to make some improvements like getting rid of the pointless restocking fee and finding a more consistent way to label items.",3
177,"App updates are ruining it: I’ve been shopping on thredUP for over 10 years. The past several app updates have made the shopping experience so much worse than its ever been. The app lets you do one search, but when you try to do a 2nd search, it freezes so you have to kill the app. When you kill the app, it logs you out. It also logs you out every time you leave the app so you have to log back in every single time you open it. When you try to add a brand to search, it only shows you a few of the brands containing that word. So if you were to try to create a search for the brand ‘ash’ for example, it will show you a bunch of brands that contain the word ‘ash’ but the brand ‘ash’ doesn’t come up. They also got rid of the view ‘all women’ button so you have to click on dresses or skirts and then go to the category button and select ‘all women’ manually. Half the time it glitches when I try to purchase something so I have to log in on my browser and complete my purchase there. I’m sure there are a few more annoying things I’ve run into but that’s all I can remember right now. Fix the app!",1
178,"Too expensive for secondhand.: I used to love shopping at ThredUP and you can still occasionally find good deals but they’re retail prices are way overestimated. For example they’re saying a girls Zara dress would retail for $43 and have it priced secondhand at $23. No dresses in the girls sizes on the Zara website are retailing for more than $36 and most are $20-$26. Also the restocking fee is infuriating when you get sent something with a stain or an inaccurate description. I try to avoid synthetic materials and have been sent clothing described as “100% cotton” or “100% linen” when they actually were a blend of synthetic, multiple times. It seems like the integrity of this business has really been forgotten and they’re doing what that can to make as much money off of you as possible. I can thrift clothes locally or get organic cotton clothes off of H&M and from small businesses and have my money go further in quality, consistency and shopping experience. I often leave ThredUP purchases with dissatisfaction and feeling like I got ripped off.",3
179,"Do not send your clothes here: Updated review. Thought I’d give them a second chance and never again. They processed my bag and my payout was $60 for about 30 great items. Not thrilled with the number but am fine with it. My big complaint is that they issued my credit in the form of a thredUP gift card which I never asked for and the company wont change it over to cash credit to transfer to my bank out. My first bag was processed as cash credit. Ive contacted multiple times and even though it was their mistake giving me a gift card I have no use for they refuse to make it right. If this company is really hurting for $60 I feel sorry for them. Just a warning to all of you that are thinking about “donating” your close to this company.

Worst place to make money off your gently used clothes. Lucky if you make $1 on an item. So far they have sold 2 of my items, one that was a like new anthropology dress that my cut was .35 cents and the other item .22 cents. Probably could have sold it to a homeless person for more and wouldn’t have had to go through the hassle of shipping to thredup and the long processing time.",1
180,"Love love love buuuuuut...: I’ve used ThredUP to add to my wardrobe for over a year. The clothes are 99% as described, and the site is easy to use. I haven’t had any problems returning items, as long as I follow the very clear instructions. I love that I can get quality clothes at an affordable price, and I often get compliments on my outfits. 

I have also sent them items I no longer want to sell on the site. This has yielded mixed results: they are not consistent in what they accept, and the amount they pay varies. It’s a great option for the items I would have just donated, but for any old clothes I think are worth money, I stopped sending because of the inconsistency. 

With all that in mind, buying from ThredUP is a buyer beware situation. I know my measurements, and I try to shop based on that. There are so many different designers and brands, and the sizings vary. As long as you pay attention to the description, I think the site is incredible!",5
181,"Horrible service: I have now had 2 thoroughly horrible experiences with this company. The first was due to my inexperience and lack of thorough information on ThredUP’s part. The second was horrible due to so many errors on ThredUP’s part. Mistagging 2 Missoni dress and selling them for $12 and $18 before I was even notified that my items were received and live. They lost 2 items, gave items away items in their goodie boxes, they mistagged 50% of what I sent, had the wrong retail prices so I couldn’t properly increase my prices. They took forever, weeks and weeks to make corrections. And on top of all of that the payouts on lower priced items is an absolute joke. So if you like being scammed then this is the company for you. They blame a lot in the extreme influx of items during the pandemic but no one was twisting their arm to continue accepting items. They should have closed down when they could not handle anymore. I really don’t have one good thing to say. I had to do so much babysitting of my items that the time I wasted I could have just listed the items myself and made way more money. I doubt I’ll ever use them again. So use them at your own risk.",1
182,"Goody box not so good: I received my first ever goody box today. I was so excited to see what I got but when I opened my box I was sadly extremely disappointed! The very first item I pulled out was a black cocktail dress that had what appeared to be bleach stains all over the back of it. Not a good first impression to say the least, but I thought “this must be a fluke” so I continued on. But much to my dismay I only found two other items that were stained by what appeared to be coffee stains and tattered from wear. Also in my box were shirts that matched my specific description of what I did NOT want, a pair of pants that were a little too snug, and a beautiful Marc Jacobs skirt that was just out of my price range. The one item I listed as something I wanted to see I didn’t get and that was a pair of shoes. Long story short, I didn’t keep ANYTHING in this box and will be canceling my membership. This was EXTREMELY disappointing and I wouldn’t recommend ThredUP to anyone who doesn’t want to waste time sorting through items that are pitched to you that they’re in “such great condition you might mistake it for new” when in reality it’s just a bunch of stained up garbage!",1
183,"Love to thrift with ThredUP: I’ve been thrifting clothes my whole life but it’s never been as fun as this. ThredUP makes it easy to search for multiple sizes (for my daughters and myself) at the same time, and the prices make previously out-of-reach clothes accessible to us, while also making wise choices for our planet. I live overseas, which makes returns nearly impossible, but I have only had a few purchases from ThredUP not work out. One was a lovely pair of jeans that fit perfectly, but after wearing them only once, the fabric stretched and tore along the back pocket. 
One suggestion I have is to include waist measurements for skirts like you do for jeans. That is the best way to tell if bottoms will fit, taking the fabric content into account to allow for stretch. It’s difficult for me to buy a skirt without knowing the waist measurement. Including flat measurements of bust and waist for dresses would help as well.",5
184,"Love so far: I downloaded Thred Up about a year ago and was a little disappointed about the type of items available for purchase, very few vintage and more clothes catered for middle aged women (flowy, loose). I’m on my twenties and enjoy vintage clothing from the 60s all the way to early 2000s. I wish there were more options on that type of clothing. Its exactly like a thrift store but online, you have to dig through the selection and scour pages and pages to find exactly what you want. In terms of the items I’ve received, I have no complaints, I throughly reviewed the item before buying, looking at how it fits on the mannequin, looking at all the measurements and most importantly seeing if there’s any flaws. Also, one more thing, I wish there was a way to organize your favorites, for example, create your own categories or labels for the items, so that it would be easier to find what I favorite (I’ve favorited tons of clothes).",5
185,"Great finds on ThredUP!: I’ve used ThredUP for over a year now. I’ve gotten some really great pieces at very reasonable prices! The app is great when I have a few minutes to quickly browse and mark favorites. I prefer to view items on a regular computer monitor because the photos are often just too small to see detail on my phone (especially is an item is black or other dark color). But I can mark items as favorites then view them later on a bigger monitor. I’ve purchased via the app and the website and both work well. ThredUP often has coupon codes available, so one tip is to never buy without using a coupon! Second tip is that unless it’s a final sale, you can return items for free. I try to spend enough to qualify for free shipping knowing that I can return items that I don’t end up liking, rather than making a small purchase of one or two items and having to pay a shipping charge.",5
186,"Buyer beware: Have been waiting over two weeks for a resolution to an error on their end. I placed an order as a gift and canceled it within 10 minutes because they were the wrong sizes. Received confirmation immediately that the order was canceled and no worries. Was planning to redo the order the next day Two days later….a package arrived. It was the cancelled order. Fast forward…two weeks later, they haven’t issued me a refund, only a store credit, charged me 3x restocking fee AND stole my store credit from a previous order (listed and sold me a child’s XL dress) I wanted so badly to like thredUP, but it blows my mind that they can be “too swamped” with business to make this situation right, but not “too swamped” to ship out an order that was cancelled. ***** Update: Took a bad review to get their attention. Not sure if I will be using thredUP anytime in the near future. I appreciate them taking care of my account, but the hassle of doing business with AI customer service isn’t really worth the headache.",3
187,"Subpar clothing and nonexistent customer service: I have received so many items from thredUP, always trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. There are multiple details that are left out of their clothing descriptions, including when an item is defective and completely unwearable. I purchased a jacket that was normal size, but the sleeves would have fit a three year old.  I purchased a skirt that was supposed to be a size 8. When I received it, it was a size 18. There is no way to return them because they were purchased as non-returnable and so I am stuck. Fabric descriptions don't include whether an item should be dry cleaned. I have received items that were listed as ""excellent condition"" that were obviously worn and dirty. No way to get in touch with customer service or if there is, they have done a very good job of hiding that information. I have had some good finds, but with the money I've lost on the unwearables, I probably bought them brand new, and received them a whole lot faster than the time it takes to receive them from thredUP.",2
188,"I love it! But it isn’t perfect here are my tips as a long time user: I have had this app for almost a year now. Great finds lots of really good clothes but make sure to shop the deals and use the filters so you don’t overpay a lot of items will be a bit overpriced for the quality you get just cause of the brands. So look at the details on the item and the quality(new,like new, gently used) really well before you buy things and keep in mind bundle shipping it’s so much cheaper. Also use your points it really is a great app to use I am a Superstar rewards member and working on becoming a VIP by the end of the year. I love this app and I seriously recommend you shop smart because it’s so good. Just a few things to keep in mind when shopping. I shop using filters cause it’s easier to find what I’m looking for than just searching “lace slip dress” for ex. Sorting by fabrics, price, color and item type is the best way to shop on this app.",4
189,"No good anymore: I used to love Thred Up, their prices were actually legitimate for used clothing. Now it’s like it all went to their head because you can often buy the same item for much cheaper BRAND NEW. I also had a clean out bag that they said nothing could be used—brand new high end items with tags. I argued it because I said there were some of these items already on the site but these have more sizes! They still said they’ll just be donated. Then magically I saw a few of them a month later listed!!! I sent the links to each one to customer service with a photo of my items I sent (I was afraid this might happen!) and they of course denied that they were from me yet multiple of them were listed one after the other exactly like they came from my clean out bag!!! Mislabeled items constantly—little girls in women’s section, etc. The shoes all look disgustingly best up, not just gently worn yet you can also buy them cheaper brand new. It’s all a bit of a scam now, but I don’t believe it started that way at all. Just a couple years ago Thred Up was way different and I miss it very much. I’ll also agree with others—why no men’s section?",1
190,"Don’t expect fast shipping: I downloaded the app forever ago and got rid of it because they didn’t even have jeans in my size. I am not an abnormal size. I am an average size for my height. I decided to give it another try because I had heard there were improvements and my initial impression was great. They have improved the shopping experience and made the app much more user friendly. They have way more options and I definitely will use this for my regular shopping and plan to for my teenage daughter. The only reason I gave it a three star rating is because of the shipping. First thing it took more than two whole days for them to even ship the item at all and now fedex hasn’t updated any tracking at all. Then when they finally did, it isn’t projected to be delivered until this coming Friday. I ordered the jeans last Tuesday (today is the following Monday) so I am looking at possibly almost two weeks before the items are delivered. All in all great app just don’t be in ANY hurry to get what you buy. Order in plenty of time.",3
191,"Weird. Disappointing.: I ordered a bunch of stuff last week and made sure the sizes were correct.  I received a pair of children’s jeans in size 14 when they were supposed to be women’s size 14.  I also received a pair of shorts in size 6 that are supposed to be size 16.  I want to return these items but must print a label. My printer isn’t working so I’m SOL I suppose.  It seems a waste of nearly $40. The point in buying thrift is to save money ...  I was however impressed with the cleanliness, packaging and accuracy of everything else.  There is no reason for a human to mistake a child’s pair of jeans for women’s. The jeans are so tiny I can barely put my arm in the leg.   Lol.  Are these clothes sorted by sight seeing people?  Feeling annoyed but ordering again today anyway.  I’ve recently gained weight due to medication from serious illness so I have very little in my wardrobe I can wear.  It’s kind of fun to receive boxes full of options for such little money. This is the first time in my life I’ve ever purchased something from a thrift store of any kind. Buying used stuff may become a habit...  I wish ThredUP sold men’s clothing.",2
192,"It’s a gamble.: Omfg…apparently my lengthy review deleted itself. So I’ll make it more succinct: DO NOT PURCHASE FINAL SALE ITEMS! It doesn’t matter if they are completely false in their measurements.

When you sign up for ThredUP, some dude named James (calling himself Chief Nitwit🙄) will email you, telling you he responds to emails, though my experience is that he does not. Customer service is lacking, especially from this James, who claims to care. (Seriously, why does he bother to send out the emails to begin with??? So. Pointless.)

From the items I’ve purchased, I probably would’ve purchased 1/3 of them if I’d seen them in person before buying them. My least favorite purchase was a very pretty dress that, upon trying it on, it had a very obvious, very large stain. Confused, I went back to its pictured listing, only to find that the part with the stain was very obviously folded over to conceal it. Pretty sure they slapped me with the restocking fee on that, as well as other items I received that were obviously not sold in good faith. Whatever. Enjoy the money I feel robbed of, James!",2
193,"Cool concept but...: I’ve been shopping on thredup for a couple of years now. It’s definitely addicting as they get new items almost daily. However-! The prices on most of the clothing is pretty ridiculous. Definitely not accurate (even some of the new with tag items aren’t priced properly, I’ve done my homework). And the used items? Are still almost as much as when they were brand new from the store. So my issue with this app is that it is not at all accessible to everyone the way thrifting SHOULD be. If thredup really cares about changing the way we shop and helping us live more environmentally conscious and sustainable, it should be priced accurately so that it’s accessible to everyone and not just people who can afford to shop as if you’re buying retail. Also, I’ve seen some questionable content on here that give me major conservative vibes so I would also suggest being more conscious of what they choose to sell under their name cause that’s not what I want my money supporting.",3
194,"HANDS DOWN THE BEST: Ok so I never really liked doing the whole thrifting or consignment thing because I have expensive taste and love high-end/luxury brands. BUT. THREDUP IS AMAZING. It has all the premium brands I love and at a great price. Even if you can’t afford the expensive stuff, they have amazing everyday brands at such a good price. They ship quite quickly, seeing as usually each piece of clothing you order comes from a different part of the US. I also love how you can sort by size (pants, shirt, dress, and shoe) and have it saved and automatically filter every time you search (I search every 6 hours). I ALSO love how you can ‘heart’ something and it is saved into a tab that can be easily accessed at the bottom so I can see if something I liked dropped in price or is still available. 10/10 would recommend ThredUP, as it has helped me find great quality/high-end brands to upgrade my ‘collegey’ wardrobe into a young professionals’ wardrobe.",5
195,"Thrifting Galore: Basically I’ve been thrifting since before it became so popular. I grew up with hand-me-downs from family and from there it went to garage sales and second hand stores but the selection in my sizes were become less and less. I tried other online thrift shopping but that was basically one item at a time from various sellers. I’d seen ads for ThredUP and thought there had to be some kind of catch but to my delighted surprise ….everything has been amazing. Well with the exception of shipping but we are sometimes at the mercy of certain delivery services. But ThredUP strives to make everything as perfect as possible and for that and the amazing selection (btw I love that you can do the selecting of sizes in different categories and it only shows you your sizes) of beautiful quality items, I will forever be a huge fan and frequent buyer from ThredUP.",5
196,"Mixed Review: I want to give five stars because I love the concept. I love the great finds and reasonable prices and flash discounts and sales. Any time I have had an issue with an item, customer service has been responsive, extremely helpful, and kind. 

But I will never, ever return an item to them again. I'll be far more wary of making on the fence purchases and those I do make that don't work out- I'll just re-list for sale elsewhere. The returns process is infuriatingly slow, which is odd because I am only a matter of hours and one state away from their returns department. While it's taken a package that took a matter of days to arrive on my doorstep, two weeks to return to its destination vis a vis the pony express, the items have clearly sat untouched for days now and I do not have an account credit. People don't want to wait a month for their money back! The return process should be as fast, efficient, and seamless as the order filling! Process improvement, people!",4
197,Pretty awesome: At first I was a bit nervous to buy clothes online and to make it worse second hand clothes. But my end result after receiving all my clothes which where 4 different packages because they came from 4 different warehouse I’m pretty happy with my purchase. If you’re going to shop here you have to keep in mind it’s a second hand store. And read the description below of every clothes it tells you the condition of the clothes. 2 pieces out of 8 didn’t fit me but that’s my fault became I chose a size that doesn’t fit me no more thinking I was still that size. And I only bought clothes that said it is in excellent condition which it is true my clothes came in in excellent condition. Oh and I placed my order on the 9th of June and I receive all my clothes by the 16th which I think is pretty awesome. I really like this app and will be buying more clothes from here.,5
198,"Better for shopping than selling: ThredUP is better for buyers than it is for people trying to sell their clothing. I’ve bought some kid’s clothes and shipping was fast and clothes were in good condition. They don’t have the widest selection, but they do have name brands and plus sizes which is great. They only have women and kid’s clothing, so if you’re a man or shopping for a man,  you’ll have to look elsewhere. I don’t know why they don’t sell men’s clothes. 

I heard good things about selling used clothes with ThredUP. However, I’m still waiting for my clean out bag to be processed. I sent it off in December. I understand the pandemic is making things hard for a lot of these companies, but I can’t help but feel a little disappointed. 

TL:DR- ThredUP is a good shopping app if you’re looking for second hand clothes that are in great condition or are looking for name brands but don’t want to spend name brand prices. Clean out bags take forever to process, though.",4
199,"Worst subscription service and customer service: I received my first box, was a little disappointed with the assortment but was able to keep a few pieces that had tags. The prices for the used clothing was double than a thrift store.  Sent back what I didn’t want and was charged for what I did want, about $89. Waited for the next box to come which never arrived. I received an email stating I never sent back the first box. I went around and around with customer service. I sent proof of delivery and payment for the items I kept. I asked how could you charge me for items that I kept when you wouldn’t have known what I kept unless you received the box back? They said they would help me with a refund. I never asked for a refund. I had nothing to refund.  Just wanted the next box. After 3 different people and a week of time, I was just told oh yes you did send the box back but you don’t have a subscription you only asked for one box. What?! I sent screenshots of every email and my account where it states Goody Box subscription. So nope, no thanks. I’d rather just shop at a thrift store. The clothes will be better quality and much lower in price.",1
200,"Love love love!: I’ve been shopping on ThredUP for a couple of years at least. I find such good deals and cute items here!  I’ve made returns for items that didn’t work out, and it’s been surprisingly simple. I’ve happily redeemed reward points (Yes! Bonus!) 

 The phone app makes it really easy to do some “window shopping” and ❤️ items I like before I’m ready to order. At first that’s how I shopped on my phone. But recently I started placing orders right on the phone, too.  I can check on my orders, reward points or check anything on my account from the phone. I actually like using the phone app more than shopping on my laptop now.  This app is fully functional and it’s easy to filter searches. I can view details about chosen items, such as measurements and fabric, and I can magnify the pictures for a closer look. The checkout process is always smooth.  I’m very pleased with the app and my entire ThredUP experience.",5
201,"Love this company!: I made a commitment to buy only used clothing in 2020, which would have been impossible for me if this company didn’t exist. I live in the country and don’t want to shop at Walmart or drive an hour into the city to shop amongst the crowds.
I recommend several improvements to the shopping experience. First, allow sorting and filtering on the favorites list.  Second, create something like a personalized feed with my favorite brands, colors and styles, which I can edit at will, kinda like a super search with a lot of options. Third, allow for users to alert staff when a description is obviously wrong. For example, I’ve found a zip up hoody classified as a pullover sweater, and a crew next sweatshirt identified as a short sleeve polo. Finally, there are certain items that never have measurements, like jackets. I’m very busty and won’t buy anything without a measurement. Also, why do pants and shorts have waist measurements but not skirts?",4
202,"Waste of time; support locally instead.: This was a huge waste of my time and an inefficient use of resources that could have gone straight into my local community.  

Huge bag of stuff, mostly new, some with tags, only offered me pennies (literally like 30 cents average per item when they are selling for like $12).  The clean out kit took FOREVER to arrive **and I was CHARGED to receive back items they didn’t want**).  Entire process from sending things in till waiting for them to sell has been almost 5 months.  FIVE MONTHS.  ThredUP took nearly THIRTY items - so they clearly liked what I sent in.  After all was said and done, I got $15.  I would have preferred to just donate locally instead of giving my items to the ThredUP company to profit off of.  I actually feel guilty for giving them anything because I don’t think they are a business to support. They are just a slick talking “sustainable” and “trendy”, marketed by paid bloggers company who is profiting from items that could just remain in a community were people really need them.  If you’re looking to make money, find another platform.  If profits aren’t really the motivator, just donate your stuff.",1
203,"“New with tags” dress that arrived with extreme damage to the fabric: There’s a little risk assumed when you buy from an online consignment shop.  However, when you see “new with tags”, it should be clear that the garment hasn’t been worn or is free from damage.  I bought a beautiful Romeo and Juliet Couture dress tagged as “new”.  The dress had 3 clear plastic tag holders with no tags attached and had 5 different areas of severe wearing on the fabric.  Definitely had been worn several times or put through a paper shredder. I returned the dress with a note saying that the dress was incorrectly marked and they need to get a better QA process.  I have bought pants that had been altered, shirts missing buttons, etc that i have replaced on my own dime. Again, I assumed risk because I’m buying used.  But not when it says NEW. 
I looked at ThredUps website and see the exact same dress for sale as “new with tags”.  But to add insult to injury, it’s also marked as final sale which means that you’re stuck with a worn dress for $60 that has pilling and extreme signs of wear on it.  This is shady and false advertising.  It’s misleading people and very unethical!",1
204,"ThredUP is a solid app!: I was able to select my exact size(s)— yes; you can select multiple sizes at once— on every type of clothing so it would only show the sizes I was shopping for, I could search by clothing type or color or anything else (they have something like 20+ different options under filters alone, like- it’s crazy). It feels a lot like shopping on Shein, when it comes to having a massive selection (almost infinite) of clothes to choose from. Only this has high-end brands (expensive designer/runway brands) and you’re buying mainly used clothing which is not only better for your wallet, but better for the environment. Plus you can find discount codes online and also they give you discounts on top of the discounted items. And they allow you to use Affirm, which is an after-pay app, so you don’t have to pay all at once.",5
205,"Rip off people who sell their items to them: My only experience selling to Thread Up was That I gave them 4 brand new items a Valentino NWT mini wallet a nwt Calvin Klein genuine leather ivory handbag from the designer line bought at Nordstrom a old navy jacket.

What did I get in return? $55 yes $55 for these items. Will forever feel ripped off. 
Then to make matters worse they made me wait to get my measly amount of money too. Just in case the buyer returned. Then to get my actual cash money have to use Stripe. More fees hassle.  They count on that so you’re forced into buying something on their site. 
The items in general top brands are still sold on site at hefty prices so buyers aren’t getting much in the way of bargains either. You may get a deal on less popular brands but you have to net $79 purchase for free shipping. 

I do not respect this company at all because they take full advantage of the sellers who box up their great even new items send thinking they’re going to earn money.  I have found some very cute items on the site but many are way overpriced like their juicy Couture velour pants that have wear they ask $30-$60 still ridiculous 
They’re are way better options at better prices.

I do also feel guilty buying from them even though selection is good because some poor seller got ripped off like I did.

I’m successful on another resale platform that treats both sellers and buyers fairly!

There are many other platforms out there.",3
206,Not what I expected.: When I found thredUP I thought it was a cool online thrift store with great prices. I bought a few items for my daughters and loved all the pieces that I received. I mailed them my clothes I wanted to sale and asked for the ones they didn’t want to be mailed back to me. Nowhere did it say I had to pay $10 for it to be mailed back to me. They chose 2 items and I received 80¢ for them. There is an option to take from your earnings to pay that $10 but how can anyone pay that if you’re earning less than a dollar for a piece of clothing? Better off selling them at a yard sale or OfferUp. The prices now on kids clothes are way expensive for one basic onesie that you can buy a set of 5 new elsewhere...I came here expecting it to be a good place for people to sell used clothes for a reasonable price not retail price. I will be uninstalling and shopping somewhere else. Giving it a 2 star because the clothes I received were cute! Loved the quality and clothes but for used clothes the prices are a lil much for someone who is thrifting at these prices might as well buy new.,2
207,"Love it, but could fix a few things: First of all, love that you can thrift your own items without having to do anything other than mailing it in. Don’t even have to pay initial shipping. Second of all, I love the second hand items I’ve found. Unique. Vintage. Thrifted. Love, love, love! My only piece of feedback is that their measurements can be wildly off. Some items don’t offer measurements at all. You really have to operate off of “I’m a blank size in this brand, so I can order this.” Women know that sizes are inconsistent across brands. If it’s an unfamiliar brand or you have any reservations, don’t buy. I’ve bought items that were both larger and smaller than advertised. In one case, petite sizing was not disclosed, as it should have been. Small and petite small are wildly different. If their measurements were accurate, this would be my only clothing stop. Because I cannot trust their measurements, I’m not 100% on board.",4
208,"Love this way of thrifting: I stumbled on thredUP about a year ago and have gotten most of my clothes there ever since. I love that I can shop thrift online. Prices are great and returns are easy. There are some things that could be improved, though. There should be better descriptions of the item and more pictures. It would be nice to see the clothes on a model instead of a mannequin (I imagine this helps keep the cost down). With the way the clothes hang on the mannequin It is impossible to see the side of clothes, the real shape of it and other details. Oddly enough, I do enjoy the surprise when I receive the clothes and they are pretty different in person, lol. It’s fun to be surprised by all the details I didn’t know about. 
There should also be more measurements of the clothes. There are some measurements there but not enough to help. Other than those things I really enjoy shopping here and will continue to use them.",4
209,"Don’t buy from here: I’ve seen their commercials and I decided to purchase from them. I bought 3 items, the cancelled one of my items bc they said “Occasionally a listed item is unable to be located or found to have quality issues” So they partially refunded me for the item and didn’t refund me the full amount. It was weeks before I even gotten an email stating my order has shipped. I had to go in the app and check the status of my order. I contacted support and that didn’t help. I finally found their email and contacted them that way….still no response. 

I will not be buying from here ever again. First time ordering and it was awful. Why list items that are unlocatable and or have quality issues? You should have a disclaimer stating that before purchase. I’ll take my business somewhere else. The thing they cancelled was my Michael Kors boots, the non designer (non name brand stuff) is being shipped still. Like does this “unlocatable items” only affect the designer brands? Their commercials are an obvious lie…some of their name brand stuff isn’t affordable or cheap, it’s still expensive.",1
210,"Warning, they sell your “rejects” to other companies and give you nothing: At first I loved thredUP. I bought a few pieces from them and had a positive experience as a buyer. Until I decided to sell to them. I ordered a donate bag, filled it up with clothes that sat in my closet and dresser unworn for a while, and waited. Two things I was hesitant to sell were some very nice, on trend jeans that I never wore due to being too small, and a designer dress I wore once. I thought those items would get sold fast, but lo and behold they never posted them to sell. And the dresses they did post to sell on their site they removed a bit for reasons unknown. Where did my clothes go then? My payout? $9 y’all. Sketchy is too nice a word for this company. You’ve been warned. Buy, don’t sell to them. Most of the items they chose to sell and pay me for were the low end target brand items, while the higher end name brands were no where to be seen. They sold those items to third party vendors and pocketed 100% of the proceeds, while I got $9 from the cheaper stuff they chose to sell on their site. Shame on you thredUP!",2
211,"Takes a long time: I like it enough, but it takes forever to get the clean out bags so that you can send them back. and it does take forever to get what you ordered and if you get a credit it’s like you want to see what you ordered first see how it looks and feels and all of that before you go buying something else and then you lose out on some money. I wish they would give you more time to use the first $10 that they give you and more time overall maybe up to three months. Only because it takes forever to get your first order while all the orders that you get it takes a while to get here. takes more than two weeks for your first order, so how do you know if you want to use that $10 or not? Maybe just give a little bit more time for your customers to use any credits or money that you give towards other products. Or get the product to them faster🤷🏼‍♀️",4
212,"Nothing but...AWESOME!!!: I absolutely love love love ThredUp!!!! Love is an understatement. I bought three tops in my first order and one didn’t fit. I decided to keep it and lose weight to eventually fit it one day. I then continued to shop DAILY on ThredUp, downloaded the App from the very start AND I have not looked back since! I the ease of using the App is a plus, Returns are effortless, prices are delightful for my budget and items are “as advertised “ upon receipt. The only downside is 24 hour limit in cart, but it totally makes sense! I don’t ever want to pay full price for clothes EVER AGAIN!!! 

I ventured to try a Goody Box and OMG, I am completely Sold! Thredup please give me a job so I can get an Employee discount, in addition to all the great perks of referrals and sales/final sale!!! I tell EVERY WOMAN in my life about ThredUp and even though no one has actually bought anything, I am hopeful, looking forward to the $10 referral reward....",5
213,"They send me trash all the time.: I spent this summer trying to update my wardrobe. 80% of what I received was trash. Most of it should have been labeled “flawed gem” but they were said to be in great condition. I received 2 items with holes, one with completely destroyed elastic, one with oil stains all down the front, one with pink sharpie marker on several spots, and one dress that they said was black (twice) but was dark navy both times it was send to me. In some cases the items were unreturnable and had to be trashed. In others I didn’t see the stains until after the return option was over. I did my best to scrub out the stains but that left me with faded spots or faded dresses. I did get my money back in some cases but the times, stress, disappointment and they way you practically have to reinvest the money back into the app like taking a risk on a slot machine has made the whole experience terrible. With all the money I lost and the junky items I now have I’m fed up with thred up and I’m deleting every. Could have been good if they were pickier about what they sent out. But they send trash that NO ONE wants.",1
214,"Loyal customer no longer: I have been shopping from ThredUP for many years but I am done. I agree with the many reviews that highlight the horrendous customer service that the company is known for at this point. Lord help you if your package doesn’t arrive, because these people sure won’t care. Furthermore, the restructuring of the reward system is a mockery to your longtime customers. You can not call something a ’reward’ when you are taking away the few bonuses that were offered in the first place. The points that I have earned from shopping at your site just three weeks ago were worth double at that time. A $10 credit for the same amount of points in the new point system is now worth only $5. You cheated me out of what I had already earned. I have seen a lot of changes to your site and business over the years and none of them have been favorable to your longtime customers. Yet for years I have loyally supported you and told friends, family, coworkers, etc about your company and how much I love it. No longer. I will spend my money elsewhere.",1
215,"Scammers: Whoever is giving five star reviews for this horrid company is a liar. They sell your clothes for $30 bucks and give you your ‘fair’ share of $0.71. You have to pay a $12 Return fee for unaccepted items or they keep your stuff and sell it anyway for extra profit. And if the stuff they take does sell, your share won’t even come close to making a profit. (Coming from someone whose balance is in the negatives from the last bag they sent in). And if you’re feeling charitable DO NOT give your clothes to them. They openly admitted they only donate a max total of $5 to the charity you pick so if you send in two hundred dollars worth, they’re pocketing the other $195.

I also just bought some clothes for the first time in a desperate measure to have something to wear to my cousin’s wedding. Not worth returning because they rip you off there too. You have to pay them to take it back and you have to pay the shipping unless you’re okay with their equivalent of store credit.

This company is nothing but a bunch of thieving money grubbers and everyone should stay as far away as possible.",1
216,"Great site for online shopping: I have never been disappointed with a purchase from ThredUP. ThredUP gives me the perfect way to replace worn clothing with items in similar styles from brands I either would like to try at a low price point or have already learned to trust. I always find at least a few budget-friendly items in EUC-NWT very quickly--often at an additional discount with free shipping. The filters are helpful ways to cluster similar items for browsing. Knowing how many others are interested in the same items helps me to prioritize and purchase a few of my favorites. The accuracy and usefulness and comparability of the descriptions is very helpful. The comparable images of each item (using standard mannequins (especially the back views and the torso views of women's bags and purses) are really helpful. I am a repeat buyer, and happy customer.  ThredUP.",5
217,"Great shop, app should be improved: First I LOVE thredUP, love to get great premium clothing at sale prices. And there are tons of sales on top of that. Saved searches, retaining my sizes, all great!! I recommend thredUP as a whole to anyone. The biggest negatives is the $2 restocking fees on all items and $9 return shopping. I’m SO bummed that restocking fees are only waved with reward points on 3 items max…
My biggest gripes are with bugs in the app that are months old. 
1. A couple times my entire cart was CLEARED, well under the 1h time limit. They didn’t even appear under Recently Removed. 
2. There’s this annoying, non obvious bug when you search- the app takes awhile to catch up. If you search too soon (before the suggestions appear) it will only search up to and excluding the last word, so sometimes the search results don’t make sense. 
3. If you search successfully and update your filters (like updating to exclude a size), it will search with your filters but WITHOUT your search terms, so just random clothes. Very very frustrating. 
Aside from those, I’d ask for a feature request: Overall, searching with multiple sizes is difficult! I can’t filter on sizes per category like other sites, so I have a ton of useless results because I’m differently sized in tops and bottoms. Very frustrating.",5
218,"Excellent selection! Learn how to use the FILTERS!!: I’ve been shopping on ThredUP for about 7 years. There are countless “gems” here. You just have to learn how to find them. READ all of the tips provided on the app. It’s like anything else that you want to excel at. You’ve gotta understand how it works, go through a little trial and error, and enjoy the learning process while you shop. There’s high end designer clothing, lower end, and everything in between. It’s a matter of personal taste. 
They offer “ shop this outfit “ (really cool), plenty of filters to apply to find specifically what you’re looking for, and a “condition” filter. This includes new with tags, like new, gently used… Watch for sales!!! I get text alerts for sales. They have a lot! This weekend they had 70% off the already discounted price. Love it!! Most items can be returned, unless marked final sale.",5
219,"MOSTLY good: I have used this app for a couple of years now (first time, I believe, was 2015 or 2016). Most of the items I have received were in really good condition. However, even though I always search for “like new” or “new with tags” items, I have received  items in multiple orders with stains. One pair of leggings I got for my daughter even had a hole in the back of one of the legs. I couldn’t see these defects online or I wouldn’t have bought them. Another thing I wasn’t super impressed with was when I ordered a closet clean out bag. They say that some of your items might be rejected due to them being stained, ripped, out of style, etc. So before sending any of the items I made sure they were in excellent condition. One of the items specifically was a nice Club Monaco dress that I had worn maybe three times that they never even listed for sale (?). Overall I like the variety of items available, the price for most things and I like buying secondhand pieces.",3
220,"BUYING GREAT SELLING RIPOFF: Buying from thred up you can get fabulous deals, BUT SELLERS BEWARE!! When I was moving last year and cleaned out my closest I sent about 12-14 bags in to Thred up with new items and all nice items with lots of Designer names like Coach, Lulemon, Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, DKNY, you name it!! I found some of my Coach purses listed as unbranded and sold for pennies on the dollar, I had 3 brand new pairs of women’s Nike $150 running shoes cutest most trendiest styles never purchased and disappeared, and overall made $150 from thousands of dollars on merchandise.  I could have sold one of those handbags on a competitors site for that amount. I realize THRED up lists their prices they give but to list obvious items that are stamped as unbranded and to keep merchandise that isn’t seasonal and is new without tags is sketchy and I personally will take the time to either sell item by item or donate to thrift verses giving to a company who profits from my loss!!",5
221,"My main shopping center: I LOVE ThredUP!!! I discovered this app during the Pandemic and got hooked. I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of money on this site but most of my wardrobe is made up of quality brands and worn-in items from TredUp. 

I really appreciate that I can shop based on the condition of the items. I tend to put a lot of items in my favorites or “saved” section so I can come back after I made a decision. Also making returns is so easy and the point system means I always have the option the waive restocking no fees or receive a discount on my full order. 

The only thing I would change is being able to see the clothes on a real human before I buy them. Otherwise, I can’t recommend ThredUP enough. if you’re someone who is against fast fashion and cares for the planet but also loves to shop this is the right place for you.",5
222,"Selling clothes to them is not worth it!: I sent in about 30 something clothes; women and little girl clothes. All were in really good shape because I took out all the ones that for sure were beat up and/or stained. They only paid me for 16 of the items and guess how much they paid...... 12 CENTS!!!!! Now if you buy from this app you see how much they sell the used items for. This company is making a KILLING off people’s used clothes. I made more money selling my clothes to Buffalo Trading company here locally. And frankly I rather give my clothes to thrift stores, atleast when they resell they actually price it VERY well, not as if your buying from an actual retail store like this one. Definitely not giving anymore of my clothes to this company..

After writing this I just read some of the people that have sold their clothes to this company and sad to say I’m not alone! I should have read these reviews before selling to ThredUP. Lesson learned. 

Please no need to respond to my review. This is strictly to bring awareness to those that are thinking about selling their clothes. Your response and/or apology won’t change my mind. What’s done is done.",1
223,"Very unhappy with customer service and app: Recently placed a fairly big order with a new mailing address. Entered the correct new delivery address and as soon as I hit the button to confirm purchase the delivery address defaulted to my old mailing address. Immediately tried to cancel the order, when that didn’t work, I immediately “tried” to contact customer service. By the time they got back to me, the package had already left the facility. While I have a current forward in (after working 10 years with the USPS) I knew there was a good chance the package would be delivered to my old address anyway, and sure enough it is being delivered there today. Now I cannot get my package, or a refund of my money. Basically I just handed over $100+ to the company for nothing. A, it should not be impossible to change shipping address (which was correctly entered during the ordering process) immediately following order placement, and B, if a mistake is made by the company or the app, I should not be the one eating the cost of the mistake. Not sure I will be using thred up again, which is a bummer, because I like the product offered.",1
224,"Only send them garbage clothes you plan to donate: i recommend only selling to Thredup if you’re going to just donate your clothes anyway and want to try and get some meager payout for them. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m not sending them anything anymore. I just recently sent them two brand new Harley Davidson jackets and the amount they pay out on them is total dog SH*T. It’s extremely aggravating. I could have sold them on eBay. They could easily afford to pay out better on clothes they sell since they mark them up considerably. Their current payout certainly doesn’t motivate people to send them new or high quality items. Additionally, if you want to get your items back that they don’t accept, you need to pay $16 “return assurance” when you order your clean out bag. Considering how little they pay out for items, $16 is a LOT!!! You’re really rolling the dice by getting return assurance. Either way it’s incredibly aggravating. I’m taking my clothes to Plato’s Closet from now and maybe I’ll send ThredUp whatever crappy leftovers. I honestly think I’d rather donate them and at least the money could go to a charity rather than ThredUp.",1
225,"The worst customer experience: Apparently recently Thred Up changed their options with returns, I wanted to return a couples items that didn’t fit for a merchandise credit. I didn’t realize the options changed, in error I clicked on the option to keep items & receive a store credit for a portion IG what I paid. First of all they do not fit why would I want them and second it’s less than half of what I paid. Immediately I contacted customer service, I tried to talk to the online automated agent I was then directed to send an email…. there was no phone number to call. I sent an email and  explained what happened, I even included I was a long time customer and didn’t realize the options changed. They said they can’t help me, nothing they can do. 
I responded upset why would I ever want clothes that don’t fit I never received a response. Oh and the kicker the store credit provided for less the half of what I paid is now gone ,apparently it expired after a couple weeks. So I have clothes that do not fit me and lost my credit for a portion of it. Disgraceful!!!!! Awful",1
226,"Easy to work with / no hassle returns: I love this company!  I’ve never received anything that I wasn’t happy with.  It may not have worked out for me, didn't fit it or I wasn’t happy with how it looked once I tried it on, but not once have I been disappointed by the  item.  I wish they would put a few more details in the descriptions and it would be awesome to have more views of the item, but  you can figure a lot out by Boeing up the picture and looking at the details of the item. Returns are so easy. I love their no hassle system.  Sure there is a restocking fee, but there is no shipping to return anything so it’s worth it.  I’ve cleaned out my closet several times. I’d love to get more “store credit” for my items, but they have to make a profit to stay in business and to be able to keep the prices so low.  I’m very happy with my experiences. ~Che",5
227,"Obsessed with this site! TOO INCREDIBLE FOR WORDS!: I cannot express how much I love ThredUp. ❣️❣️ I’m a major thrift store junkie and there’s nothing that thrills me more than a bargain; getting a great deal on amazing items is what gets my blood pumping.

I bought 10 pairs of shoes/boots from ThredUp - most were brand new and the few that weren’t new definitely LOOKED brand new. All were from brands like Coach, Ralph Lauren and Sam & Libby (to name a few). Every single pair, miraculously, fit me PERFECTLY except for one pair of boots, which I gave to a friend because they were just too cute to return. I don’t even want to divulge what I paid for the 10 pairs of shoes but suffice it to say, it came out to under $17 per pair. $17 for flawless, perfect Coach sandals. I mean, WHAT??!! 

Granted, it’s not like some thrift stores out there where you can sometimes find diamond in the rough surprises for $2 or $3, but for the stellar quality, customer service, and range of options you get on this site, there’s simply nothing like it. I need to be careful because it’s too easy to convince myself that everything I find on the site should be immediately purchased - I mean, yes a bargain is a bargain but if I’m buying 200 “bargain” items, it really starts to add up! 😂🏧💸💸💸

I’m obsessed with ThredUp and if you decide to peruse through their incredible site, you will be too. Trust. 👜👛🎒👠🥼👗👖👙👡👢👟🧣🧢🕶",5
228,"Great in Theory , Theft & Terrible Customer Service: The first time I used Thredup it was great. I got rid of some clothing and received some cash. I then tried the pilot ""Luxe"" service, selling contemporary and designer and the customer service has been a disaster. First and most importantly of all, I sent in some Charolette Olympia shoes that were stolen. They were sent and never listed and then just gone. A friend had a similar experience with a fair of Marni shoes. Secondly, you cannot get a human on the phone. You have to either email or chat and those go nowhere.  Example 1: I sold an item with a listed 40% commission but when it actually sold, I only received a 15% commission. I have sent two email in and NO ONE has responded. Example 2: One pair of Chloe shoes were size mislabeled and over a month later, despite two emails from customer service, they're still listed at the wrong size! Note to management: if you want to continue to exist as a business, fix incorrect payments and website description errors ASAP. Atrocious customer service and this is with selling partners. I can't imagine what being a customer with an issue must look like.",1
229,"From office to country retirement: I’m so glad I saw your ad in a who-done it show I was watching.   Since I’ve retired I have no clothes that are appropriate for Cold Winters and Hot Summers. With a closet full of Citified clothes, they definitely have to go, I was boiling and freezing, and frustrated. Now I’ve begun to replace with wool, and cotton. Plus with this easy life I gained weight, your program of providing articles that have taste and character to an otherwise boring carefree life style clothes has made me a ‘tree hugger’ I’m even repurposing wood, tiles and recycling everything, not to mention that I can sell my clothes from a packed closet that were just sitting there, now they can be someone’s ‘treasured finds’. I thank you. The Affirm company has also been a plus plus in this new concept of saving our planet by helping us make payments, I found it to be fun to pay each payment and to see ‘you’re all paid off.  YAY",5
230,"No communication, absurd shipping times: I’ve ordered from Thred Up in the past and it has always been a seamless experience. However, in the last three weeks I have placed three orders and have yet to receive a single one of them. They state shipping will be 3-8 days and at this point all of those orders are well beyond that. I have contacted the company three times and have heard absolutely no response to either message. I came over here to see if others were having the same experience. Was loving this service but have lost confidence at this point, mainly due to the lack of communication or response. :(. I do think things will eventually show-up but they will not be here in time for events I had wanted them for.

*Wrote this review earlier today and tracked my orders afterward and some are now pushed out even farther. 20 days (forecasted) from order date for some items that are being shipped from MY OWN STATE! I won’t be ordering again, which is too bad because I loved the ease of shopping and ordering and the quality received in the past.

So disappointed.",2
231,"Love the site! 90% of the time: Super great option to get clothes used and at a lesser price than retail, however still pricey for consignment…! I decide that it’s worth it though and pretend I’m paying for new clothes at good prices. Love the in-depth filter options. Nice to have measurements on most things. 
However: There has been times when I’ve gotten the wrong item but they return it for free. Times where an item in my cart disappears before the time allotted. Prices change daily it seems for the same item: up and down. My main dislike is that the boxes come sprayed with some kind of chemical and the scent is so intense. Buying used, I was hoping and expecting there not to be chemicals used. If the managers read this, please stop the chemicals. Other than that, I love the site and am quite addicted! Ready for the mens line to come out too!",5
232,"Fed up with thred up: First, they lost the bag of items I sent in and had someone else’s items as what I had sent them. After being told that they would figure out what happened and not hearing anything for a week, I had to contact them again where I was given a 35 dollar credit. I decided I’d purchase a shirt with their store credit for 12 dollars, and cash the rest out. Well they decided to use the portion of funds that I had not redeemed for store credit instead of the portion I HAD redeemed for store credit so I was only given the option to cash out for 13 of the 35 dollars I had been given for my clothes. After contacting customer service multiple times and not having anything followed up on, I just redeemed all of the 13 dollars for store credit and purchased clothes for my baby that’s on its way. The entire process was a hassle and had me very stressed out. All I wanted to do was sell some of my clothes and shoes for extra cash since I have a baby on the way, and I feel I was schemed and scammed the entire time. I’ll never use this company again. They basically forced me to just buy their items.",1
233,"SLOW Shipping!: It takes forever to get the items you purchase. They ship using FEDEX and I’m pretty sure snail mail would arrive sooner.  Quality control issues ... I purchased something in a XL and I was sent a XS.  Another item I ordered was a romper with a long skirt around it. The picture did not show the shorts and it looked like a long shirt.  Needless to say that went back as well.  You only have a return window of 2 weeks.  So, make sure you request a return ASAP.  The search bar doesn’t let you look for specific items (ex. Tropical maxi dress) so you would have to look through all maxi dresses to see which ones have a tropical theme. The items could be more descriptive and the pictures could be better.  Right now you only get 2 pics. The front and back of the item.  Also, the colors are sometimes washed out in the photos.  Prices can be high... Some items are basically full price.  Especially Old Navy items that you can get on sale cheaper than what T/U is selling them for.  Overall it’s decent.  But I prefer other apps over this one.",2
234,"Don’t use this app to Sell!: First I sent three boxes to Thred Up. Apparently I must have used one shipping label twice because they are saying they only received two of the three boxes yet the local UPS store where I dropped it off to ship doesn’t have it and said it should have gone back to the return address (which is Thred Up!). That aside, the two boxes they did process paid me nothing! Vineyard Vines and Ralph Lauren shirts and Sweaters in new condition only paid me 60 cents! Not even a dollar! And my Burberry jacket - zero - and to top it off, they don’t send the items back to you unless you request for items to be returned in advance and you pay for it to be returned. Why would I prepay to have items returned when there was a possibility only one thing would not be bought? Overall I’m very dissatisfied. Material World gave a better pay out but I used Thred Up this time because not everything I sent was designer. So from three very large boxes of clothes, coats, shoes boots and purses I made about $40 and still have to pay the fee to cash out on Pay Pal. I would have been better of taking tens to a local consignment store!",1
235,"Stole my nicest pieces + No customer service.: UPDATE: They have a 1.5 on the BBB. ALL of people with this exact story. I sent in a clean out bag, and they hand picked the most expensive items out of my bag and never listed them. And Theres also No Way to retrieve them. Ever. So I dont get paid or get my luxury brand clothes back. Plus the payment structure is super predatory, so you receive literal PENNIES on the dollar for your items. For example, I filled an entire Clean out Bag with items ranging from thrift store finds, to department store purchases, and they listed the thrift store stuff and some asos pieces and DISAPPEARED the LandsEnd, Lilly Etc… so now im getting the lowest payout possible for some stuff that was already second hand, and my nice stuff is gone forever. Theres also no customer service, theres a closed loop from the FAQ page back to the app home screen. And lastly, the listings are super poor quality. The pictures look bad, the listings are often incomplete or entirely inaccurate. And they use that “Always Running Discounts” approach. This app is somehow worse than a thriftstore.",1
236,"First impression: It was my first time using this app, and well I was excited to try it, I am disappointed.
I ordered clothes that were “lightly worn or barley used” when getting the clothes, it looked like people had the cloths for years and washed them a bit, but still took care of them. With that being said the material on the clothes def looked used with fuzzzies everywhere. Now I’m a really savey girl, I love to buy cheap things that look new. So I bought nicer name brand clothes and only got, cotton, wool, or cloths with a low % polyester. So when I got the cloths I was stunned to see the quality, I mean I know it is 2nd hand, but when I seen the “wool, Cotten” cardigan from Ann Taylor, and it had frizzys and was see threw, I was upset. I wouldn’t have paid 1 dollars for it at a yard sale, but on here bc you can’t see the quilts of cloths, I paid 11 dollars for it. Now I did find 1 win, it’s a  cute silky green shirt… but out of 8 pieces of clothes and 86 dollars, it’s sad that there was only one shirt I really loved. 
I recommend only buying new with tags.",2
237,"No longer interested in conventional shopping…: ThredUP has completely transformed how I shop for clothes. I found ThredUp looking for a classy outfit to wear to my company’s 20th anniversary party and immediately was so addicted I ditched almost my entire wardrobe (sent to ThredUP and Salvation Army) and threw myself into the ThredUP shopping experience. My closet is now filled with unique, high quality items that are fresh, beautiful, radically discounted, and fit perfectly. It’s so easy to buy many variations of similar things, try them all on in the peace and comfort of home, keep what you love and send back the rest. The app is beautifully designed, could hardly be easier. I may have to seek counseling - thredUP is what I think about before I go to sleep and when I wake up in the morning. This is how I am going to shop for clothes / shoes / accessories for the rest of my life.",5
238,"Disappointed in Last 6 Months: I’ve loved thredUP for years, and I’ve always an excellent experience, until about 6 months or so ago.  First, they added a “restocking fee”, which seems odd for a second hand clothing site where you have no real frame of reference for the size or quality of items.  Second, they stopped showing chest and length measurements for pieces, which means you have no idea if a labeled size 4 is really a size 4 or a size 10 marked as a size 4. Combined with the restocking fee, it feels like a bit of a scam make you buy clothing and lose a portion of the cost each time the lack of information provided makes you have to return it.  Besides that, without accurate sizing information, why bother ordering online from a site that takes weeks to get you the items you ordered and weeks to process it being returned? Super user unfriendly now.",5
239,"It’s Not a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market Anymore: Not really sure I see the value anymore (used to be much better). 
As a seller, I sent a clean out bag with 7 Ann Taylor item, 2 Nike and 1 Gap. ThredUP rated the items I sent as “Might mistake for new”. I received $4.68 for my clean out bag:(. Not to mention they way they list and pay you is confusing. I don’t know what they mean by “Reclaiming” if your item doesn’t sell in their time period. Can’t find an explanation in their FAQ’s. Are they shipping it back if I reclaim it? What the charge for it? Weird.
As a buyer - I bought 2 items.  The shipping was really slow (14 business days). Packaging not great (remember when they wrapped each item boutique style?). One of the items was pretty close to the description and pictures, the other not so much. The second item’s size was mis-marked to be two sizes larger than it actually was. I returned within the return window and it took TWO MONTHS to get a credit. Yikes!
I like the idea of recycling BUT I don’t like the thought of unfair pay outs and slow to credit for sizing/listing errors.:( Seems like they made it more complicated than it needs to be:(",1
240,"Good value needs better sizing information: I have been a thread up customer for several years and for the most part found it to be a good value. However, someone needs to more carefully measure the garments that are for sale. Some measurements are more accurate than others. Additionally, There should be an option to return purses and handbags. Or more clearly photograph purses and handbags for sale. It is hard to tell whether there is a zipper in the inside of a purse for example. When item listing says mild stain and wear it needs to show where the stains are so that a person can decide if it is subtleEnough to purchase the bag. I have found myself stuck with a bag I could not return because the item was not clearly photographed or a minor stain was in an obvious place for this reason I try not to purchase a hand bag or purse on this site.",5
241,"Dishonest.  Warning employee THEFT  twice!: Someone inside this company receiving the clean out bags is stealing from the customer, then listing the items under another account. At the moment, 15 of my items are listed from my “lost bag” under someone else’s account. Just these 15 items are listed at about 300$. I have photos, screenshots and item numbers to prove it. The new w/o tags Coach purse with dust bag is gone. ( Easily worth over $150$). There were Victoria Secrets with tags, Osh ‘BGosh, Cat and Jack items that were in the bag. Someone at ThreadUp stole my bag that would have been listed for 500+ dollars and i was given a n $80 credit for the entire bag. 

ThredUP received my bag, it was noted on my account as processing for a over a month. On May 1 that bag disappeared from my account. It was no longer listed. No contact. No explanation. It was up to me to get ahold  of customer service. 

This happened previously with 2 items pulled from a previous bag and I was give 25$ credit after I noticed and reported it. Same thing, someone was skimming $ off of items in the customer’s bag.",1
242,"Dishonest and sketchy practices: This has happened several times. Beware of items marked returnable and then changed to final sale after your order is paid for and shipped. It’s misleading and I’ve had to keep several items that did not fit or were poor in quality. I avoid final sale items because most of the time it’s clothing that’s in very poor condition. I’ll purchase a final only if it’s under $8. I have several items I just purchased and I am certain they were returnable when I submitted the order. Now as I prepare to return I’ll fitting or damaged items I find that they’ve been changed to final sale/not returnable. This is one thing they do. I’ve had many other issues that I could never resolve because they’re customer service is pretty much nonexistent. It’s a chat and they NEVER RESPOND. You’ll find better value shopping with Nordstrom rack, Poshmark, or Mercari. ThredUP consistently leaves a bad taste. They do have thousands of items and sometimes you’ll find good stuff but overall it’s not worth getting screwed by ThredUP over and over again.",1
243,"Great company with some glitches: I love thredUP I’ve been shopping them for years and gotten some great finds from them! Lately the app has been glitching on me. Had some likes disappear and I can’t for the life of me find again so idk what happened there. Further, having a lot of issues searching. The search bar/my keyboard have been freezing after like the second search and I have to close out and reopen the whole thing. Hope this is a glitch they’re fixing…
As a seller, not the best margins, but closet clean out bags are a great option and I love knowing that my wardrobe isn’t adding to the waste. Wish everything didn’t have such a high restocking fee but I guess I get it. I definitely wish they had more/better pictures. If there are flaws it should be shown or show a jacket unzipped. Anything that’s black is basically just a toss up cause details are impossible to see…",4
244,"Great Sustainable Option: I love thrifting, but there aren’t a lot of options in my rural area. Thred up is where sustainability meets affordability and ACCESSIBILITY when you don’t live in a big city with a lot of resale shops. There’s room for improvement (as with anything) in searching for items. There used to be a “find similar items” button that disappeared, and I miss it. There’s also no description of how a fabric feels outside of its fabric content. Is it Jersey? Is it flannel? Is it ponte? This can be really hard to tell just based on the picture, especially for dark colored items, and I’ve gotten a few surprises to be honest. There are also a number of times a measurement would be helpful but are missing, like skirt waist sizes. The length is given but that doesn’t tell me if I can wear it. When you can’t try this stuff on and there’s a restocking fee if you return it these little things go a long way.",4
245,"Unreliable: The measurements they have listed are either made up or a guess because I’ve ordered based on measurements and size, obviously super specific sizing, and it’s a gamble every time. I’ve had one pants out of five fit, but when you return you will either be forced to pay for shipping out of pocket or you get store credit. I dislike that all their tops seem to be the same price it was retailed, where is the bargain in secondhand? They have taken over a week just to ship an order and then their website won’t update tracking information until it’s almost to you. So it looks like it’s missing or not moving. I buy secondhand adamantly so this experience was incredibly disappointing. Many of their items aren’t marked down the way the would be in a store, even though they’re out of date, pilling or clearly lost it’s life. I even purchased a “black skirt” that they discretely hid the penstripes in the picture so I can’t wear it for work and I’ve taken a loss at this point monetarily. Done after my store credit runs out…that’s the catch and it’s bull.",1
246,"Not what it used to be: I found ThredUP a couple of years ago and it became my fun addiction.   Even at the beginning of the Pandemic last year, they never stopped and allowed me to continue to shop when most retail stores either closed or ran out of stock.   They always had new and even with the shipping delays they kept going.   BUT in the last two months something’s changed.   I only buy new with tags and like new.   On a recent order I found that a top had a hole in the sleeve and a sweater had multiple pulls.   Didn’t deter me, mistakes happen.   My last bundle order says different.   First several pieces were missing and my online chat about that was uncomfortable, almost intimating I was lying and now this morning I put on one of my ‘like new’ sweaters only to find not one but two large holes.    How that got by anyone I can’t explain.   The item is a final sale and is now in the trash.   I have another order coming so I guess we’ll wait and see but I’m not so sure I won’t be deleting this app soon.",2
247,"Always the Perfect Look: The choices in the Outlet link offer a great selection of timeless classics, many with tags still attached. Looking for something a bit more high couture? Go for Rent the Runway. Whatever you are looking for, you can find it here. Accidentally order the wrong size or just changed your mind?  I hear that returns are super simple and easy. Personally, every order I’d exactly as describe and usually better. I’ve only had the same problem I always have with off the rack purchases: the pants are too long. At barely 5 feet tall I can often wear children’s clothing. But the arms are always too short, bust size can also be problematic, but sweats? Who cares? ThredUp is almost the only place I ever buy any of my adult clothing. I always get the best compliments on the clothes I’m wearing when it’s a ThredUP purchase. This sounds a bit commercial. but it is difficult not to!",5
248,"HORRIBLE: I’m very cautious to try new websites. I read all reviews. This had a 4.7 star rating and looked legit. I ordered a goody box for $10 with supposedly 10 items. I got my box with extra pieces, and I didn’t think much. Sizes were really off (for example I’m a 2 and I got a size 14 in pants). I kept what I liked and sent back the rest. I knew it was off from the beginning because it was a 10 piece box and I sent back more than 10 items. How would they ever know what I kept? Well anyway I sent it a day before due date not to risk any additional charges. A few days later I see I was charged almost $300 for the box. I immediately contact them. They’re quick to reply but couldn’t help because on their end it didn’t show it was sent. I showed them the proof of drop off from fedex. So 2 weeks later of back to back contact with them on the status they let me know fedex basically lost the box. They did refund my original $10 for the goody box but I’m more stuck on the $300 I want back for clothes I DID NOT keep. My case is under investigation. BEWARE. Too much trouble to go through. Not worth it.",1
249,"Longtime Customer: I have been using ThredUP since 2012. The app specifically works pretty great now, although I have had issues with photos not generating. Most of the time I will see more/different options in the same search using the website. The phone notifications for a search can be a bit too much if you don’t really borrow done that search with specifics. Other than those small issues, I think the app has been running great the last year or so. 

As for the service I have had nothing but good experiences. I have ordered an item or two that showed up in the wrong size (12m vs 12y) but was fully refunded and told to keep the item anyway. That has happened with a couple items that I thought were not in great condition as well. But most everything of the billion things I have purchased had been in great condition. I have used everything multiple time as have my two kids. Recently things have been overpriced and seemingly missed categorized - like a tunic listed as a dress to get more money for it. But also things have been clearly mistakenly listed for cheap - like a boys sweater in the girls section. So I guess they balance out. 

I have turned in a selling bag before - the post lost it - but they still gave me a credit. 

It’s a bit of a game to watch and get the great pieces and deals but for us it’s always been totally worth it. And a little addictive.",4
250,"Unrealistic pricing/payouts for used garments: This company is based in San Francisco where the cost of living is outrageous and people make a very high hourly rate even in entry level roles. This company claims to set prices based on the market that you live but I can assure you that the prices are not competitive for the rest of the country. They’re downright outrageous and have increased rapidly over the last year or 2. Charging $60-80 for a used dress that I bought new at the outlets over 5 years ago for $25. I actually paid $50 for a Calvin Klein dress listed as NWT. The dress arrives with stains on it and the clearance tag from Dillard’s listed someone bought it new for $25 off the clearance rack. And what do they give you after they charge these outrageous prices for used goods? Anywhere between 25 cents and 5 bucks if you’re lucky. They need to relocate to a different city so they get out of their unrealistic pricing bubble and get with the rest of us who don’t live there. I used to be a major customer but with their prices and new $1.99 restocking fee for used goods that you have no idea what it will fit like, I’m completely disgusted with this company.",1
251,"Where are the items ?: I have sent 2 bags in the last several months. There is no record of ANYTHING that has sold! I have no way of knowing what happened to my stuff. There is no inventory or pictures of the items received. On top of that.. am I to believe that you sold nothing from those bags? Either your employees are stealing ( I had a full bag of Coach purses earlier this year. They said they had 2. According to them, 1 sold and one was donated. I had at Least 6 Coach purses and accessories. They only acknowledged the 2. This issue is not resolved and I am considering suing them as my husband is an attorney! ) For your sakes, I hope u r receiving your money. Why do they not photograph the items while removing from bag? Accountability for everyone. If the same thing is happening to others, they are making a mint. My belongings have disappeared into thin air. Maybe, a class action suit is in order!",4
252,"Both buying and selling have been great: After letting it be known that TU is trying to make changes to their process I decided to give selling a shot despite the overwhelming negative feedback. I have had multiple great buying experiences, clothes fit as expected due to great photography and available information on both fabric type and clothing measurements. That plus fast shipping makes for an awesome experience. Enter selling, I ordered a kit months ago and just got around to filling and shipping it. It took a few weeks for the package to be delivered but after it arrived at ThreadUp it was only a week or two more before I could cash out. 🤷‍♀️ 

So all in all 4-6 weeks from shipping to cash out. I sent in spring/summer clothes in the winter, everything I sent was accepted either as consignment or bought upfront. Each item is now tracked so you know exactly what’s going on with it.",5
253,"This is ridiculous: I used to love this app, I have found some amazing things but they have just introduced this new policy that you have to pay $2 per item you return that they call a stocking fee.  Yes you heard me correctly. You’re an online store, what restocking do you have to do to charge me for every item. I can understand $2 per order but per item is ridiculous! Let’s also add the fact that some of the Items are nowhere near what they say they are. I had picked an item that was said to be brand new and final sale, which means you can’t return it. Okay no problem, but when I got the item It was completely ruined. The band was completely stretched and I can’t wear it. So they lied! Furthermore, I have expressed my feelings to the customer service and have been completely shrugged off. I have never done a 180 so quickly. So let’s do some math if you order 10 items and you rerun 6, you have to pay $12 just because you tried it on. It is absolutely ridiculous!!! Please, go back to before this. I have never been so disappointed by a service so much in my life!!! I’m done with this disrespect!",1
254,"Why even buy *new*?: I can’t rave enough about ThredUp! I discovered it a few years ago and now it is my only site to buy clothes, shoes, bags. I no longer shop in store for new clothing since I know the environmental impact of clothing. And ThredUp offers guilt-free shopping. I was hesitant to buy *second-hand* but I’m over it! Who cares? Throw it in the washer and you are good to go! And these are millions of ‘new with tags’ items to get started if you are hesitant. I am now a pro at shopping, I am very careful about the brands I purchase and I check the size (I wish the items listed could provide more sizing, detail, fixes, etc, that would help a great deal). I also check the fabric to know it’s good quality. I only buy timeless styles and it comes at crazy good prices that I will wear for years and continue to receive compliments on my style!",5
255,"High quality clothes for less but app needs work: I’ve bought some of my favorite clothes from ThredUP, for less than the sale price would have been in store. Yay! 

However, there is definitely room for improvement with the app itself, and with the descriptions and photos of the clothes. It’s hard to tell what the fabric is like until it arrives, and the condition as stated on the site is labeled inconsistently. If something in the women’s section looks like it might be a men’s size, it very well could be. Likewise for children’s clothing. Lots of things labeled as “like new” or “new with tags” are shrunk or stretched or had a major error during production. I’ve had the best luck buying items from brands whose clothes I have bought new (so I have an idea of how it fits, wears with time, etc), and items I tried on in store but didn't purchase due to cost. 

Finally, I’ve had a lot of trouble with returns. What’s stated on the site is false as I’ve had to pay for shipping each time and the processing time is now over 4 months for one of my returns, and there’s no one to contact when there’s an issue. 

My advice for someone who’s thinking of trying the site? If you have good thrift stores or consignment shops near you, you may want to give ThredUP a miss. But if you don’t, then go ahead and give it a try but approach with caution.",4
256,"App functions being taken away?: I have always appreciated being able to filter tops by neckline. It was such an immense help when looking for a specific style. Now that option is no longer there on the app? I haven’t tried the web version but why???? If I want a black v-neck tshirt now I have to go through every single black top when before using the neckline filter eliminated nearly 85% of the items I don’t need to see. 

I really want to see Thredup succeed as there is such a vital need for more sustainable fashion. I understand this is a challenging business model so I hope this company keeps trying but it has to be more user friendly to find items. It is a limited number of people with time to sift through literally tens of thousands of items. Please bring back the missing filter options that used to be there and worked great. Without accurate measurements and useful filters, it’s like searching for a needle in a haystack.",3
257,"Great...despite some high prices: When I first discovered ThredUP over a year ago, I was instantly in love.  I love to browse all the different brands that I can never find in stores around here.  However, the prices of some of the used clothing has climbed to prices I am not willing to pay for used items, and this is why I only will give it 4 stars.  I could buy brand new Under Armour sweat pants for myself, or for my children, and they are sometimes $40 on this website.  I find that too expensive for something that has already been worn multiple times and washed.  I have been disappointed quite a bit recently while checking out prices.  I can get better deals shopping online for new items than I can for some of the name brand clothing on ThredUP.  I sure hope that they get back to offering the bargain prices that were once offered before.  That being said, I will still continue to shop ThredUP.",4
258,"Great, except…: The app itself is great. You can find a lot of amazing deals on here!! However I wish they would add more photos of the items, especially when an item isn’t in “excellent” condition. I understand they have a lot of items to list, but it is frustrating when I receive an item that looks different in person than it does in their photos.

They need to be a lot more careful when taking photos and listing items. I’ve seen items listed that have noticeable stains, rips, pilling etc. that they will list as “excellent” condition! They also will list things as the wrong color, so make sure you look closely at items prior to purchase. And most recently I’ve seen listings with photos of clothing items inside out! Do better…

While you can get great deals, some things are outrageously priced. Like $20 + for used target brand clothing for example.",4
259,"Great, but could use a little improvement: Personally I have no notes on the clothing, product, shipping, or consignment part. Me and my family have been using ThredUP for years and have never had issues. My complaints are solely on the app itself. While it’s very user friendly, and idiot proof, I feel like the search function could use some work. I feel like I can’t get too specific with what I’m looking for in terms of different kinds of clothing. Think ‘babydoll top/dress’ or ‘tiered maxi skirt’. I feel like having some additional search features or tags would make things a little easier. My other gripe, and this is mainly for the app, it’s WAY too easy to unfavorite something and lose it. The buttons are pretty close together and the item just disappears. I think adding a ‘are you sure you want to unfavorite this item’ pop up would solve the problem.",4
260,"Highly recommended guilt-free shopping app: I made the decision a few years ago to quit fast-fashion and only buy thrifted or verifiably sustainable clothing. Of course, option #2 is expensive and takes research, so now my whole wardrobe is thrifted and almost every item came from ThredUP.
I love the large selection of petites! And the app is fantastic really- I like being able to shop by material, condition, etc. I love being able to save my favorite search parameters. And of course, let’s not forget the clean-out bags (love those) and the reward points.
I’ve recommended this shopping app to every woman I know, and gotten more than a few hooked on it!
My ONLY complaint is that there are no mens clothes, but I know those are also lacking in brick&mortar thrift stores.
Tldr: App has good features, company has good selection. Highly recommended.",5
261,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!: I love this app so much as well as the concept behind it! Don’t get me wrong I still love traditional thrifting and do it quite often. Though, if I’m looking for specific items I go to thread up to find them! Thrifting traditionally doesn’t offer what I might be looking for at the time but thread up does! I’ve found some really great items! Only mishaps happen with sizing (Not thread ups fault) sizing mishaps happen with all clothing options. EX: the item is a small but still doesn’t fit quite right due to body proportions. If that happens to me (which it has) I donate the items that don’t fit. Thread up is spectacular and we get to find and give life to new items as customers! Plus finding what you’re looking for is simple and easy. I do enjoy the hunt in traditional thrift stores but not always! Prices seem to be fair too!",5
262,"Disappointed: At first I thought this is a great way to get rid of things in my closet that have been outgrown by my kid or myself. I have sent tons of clothing and brand new shoes never worn only to be paid dirt cheap so they can sell them for more than what I paid for them brand new. One order was sent back to me saying it had a cigarette odor and I don’t smoke. I got the clothes back and there was no smell to them so I took them to goodwill which is what I will do to the rest of the things I have to get rid of from now on. I was okay with the company at first and then after the third bag I sent in to sell was basically tossed out I started to have my problems. I have reached out to support on more than one occasion and never get a response back. So after this next cheap $5 they send me from my items I’m done and will never send another thing to them again. I could have kept those things and made more money selling them on poshmark, Craigslist or marketplace than what these cheapskates are giving me.",2
263,"Cool site but...could be much better: As a regular customer at Poshmark , I thought I’d give thredUP a try. HUGE inventory and great prices but, in my opinion, two significant areas where they fall short: 1) search options are very limited. Want to search for a dress in your size and price range? No problem. Specific color or brand? No worries.  Instantly   You’ve got 10k dresses to look at. Looking for something Jacki-O would wear? Or in the style of Mrs. Maisel? No can do. 2) pictures are limited and not great quality. Is it black? Blue? Green? Who knows. Of course you can find the color listed in the description but if the photos were high quality, that would not be necessary. 
 On those two counts - Poshmark definitely has ThredUP beat. If I’m missing something here - I’m sure ThredUP enthusiasts will correct me in which case I’ll be thrilled and will up my review. Also, just placed my first order so very interested to see how the delivery compares to Poshmark (which, in my experience) has been consistently fast!!",3
264,"Yet ANOTHER Astoundingly Bad Update: Thredup certainly offers great deals - if you are blessed enough to be able to find what you are looking for in spite of their remarkably inept software. Don’t count on searching reliably - the latest few apps are intentionally designed to obfuscate in an effort to lead you towards less popular brands/items that otherwise no-one would choose to view. Undoubtedly, Thredup is still grappling with the issue of an overstock of unsellable items (further evidenced by “goody boxes”), and instead of getting wise and therefore more selective in what they accept to sell, is forcing shoppers to navigate past this garbage, like those mandatory aisles insides the front doors of some big-box chain stores. Still missing in this “update” (downdate?) is the ability to tailor your search by style, sleeve length, etc. Also unavailable is the option to auto-buy when an item becomes available. Overall, if you are a fan of Thredup skip/delete the app and just use your browser to access the website. You will save time, aggravation, and might actually find what you are looking for!",1
265,"Great shopping option: Basically gamified shopping. And I’m hooked. The app works well, shipping is fast. Love the option to bundle orders to save on shipping. I only wish I was only spending as much as I was earning with my closet clean outs. 😂 great way to move items out of my own closet and fill it with new-to-me clothes. My only complaint is lack of consistency in review of items that are for sale. I’ve definitely received items with more wear than indicated. One item was in such poor shape, I had to toss it. It’s not worth it to return, so got a dollar something credit for one items and others were “final sale”, then you’re stuck with poor quality items that don’t match the descriptions. I think of each order as a gamble. Most items will be great, a couple will be disappointing. If quality control was improved, this app and process would be perfect.",4
266,"After years of using Thredup…: …I still mostly love it. There have been some amazing improvements in the app and some available information about items. Be noticed that pricing has taken a jump as well. It’s not necessarily unfair—some higher end clothes are really a great deal. But some things like bags and shoes don’t really follow used value. A lot of the time, used purses are priced just barely below new items. Prices for boots is the same. Brands are sometimes confused with  similar names as well—St. John’s is NOT St. John’s Bay!!  I would like to see measurements available for cardigans and jackets—we all know that “small” and “large “ can mean anything!  Customer service has improved over time as well, in terms of response time, but a lot of the time answers are “canned” and not very helpful. All things considered Thredup is a fantastic way to save money, enjoy thrifting, and get some great deals!!",4
267,"SO EASY!: I have just placed my 3rd order to ThredUP and I really love how easy it is to use their app.  The selection is insane!   I like how it saves my preferred sizes and shows me those, even as I switch between brands.   I do wish that there more more pictures and descriptions (fits small, fits true, fits large).   Although I am satisfied with their return process, I do wish it was more transparent - the goods are free to return (for store credit, which is great since I want to purchase again from there) - but once I mailed it, I had no idea of the status (received/in process/credit pending) until the credit was applied to my account.  There was no way to track on the site.   It took a little over a week for the credit to appear on my account.   Again - that’s fine.....I just wish I had known it was received; at the very least.   Overall, I am super pleased!",5
268,"Love it!: I’ve been shopping on ThredUP since early in the Covid lockdown. My daughter told me about it. I have a lot of fun shopping on it and I really like the idea of buying secondhand when I can, not only to save money but also because it makes sense to reuse what we can. I mostly stick to a few brands that I know I like but have also gotten some real deals on upscale items. I have had no problem returning items when necessary. I enjoy getting the packages - kind of like getting a present!
I’m mostly happy with the app but have found a few quirks- little things which are nothing serious. For example, I’d like to be able to shop by sleeve length so I don’t have to look at innumerable summer dresses when I want something with long sleeves. Not a big deal. 
Overall I think it’s a great concept and a fun activity!",5
269,"Great app with just one flaw in the donation process: The app and service  worked great on my first donation of items. However, ThredUP did not tell me I needed to make my own list of items I was donating and the estimated value of each item, for my tax write-off. I assumed they would do that and send me the list. I received the tax receipt, but instead of a list of the items and values the receipt included blank lines for me to fill in the information. Now thinking about it, I can understand why they don’t do it, because it would add a lot of extra overhead to their program and lower their ability to stay in business. 

Since I did not make a list before packing my bag and sending it, I will write off my best guess of what I sent. I recommend that ThredUP add a step to their instructions about donations to make a list of the items and their estimated values while adding items to a donation bag. I will be doing this from now on.",4
270,"Don’t sell your clothes to thredup: I shipped a Large box of clothes/shoes to thredup, some brand new some gently worn, in style items. Got an email saying they received 8 months later but didn’t get paid for any of the clothes until a YEAR later…and I only received $11 in thredup credits that I can’t even see unless I log in a certain way using the email they sent. They aren't on my app so I can’t even check out using them unless it’s on the website. I used to work in a thredup warehouse and I do not recommend. Unless you’re selling them a very large box of expensive brand name or designer items you most likely won’t get any money and there’s no guarantee you will get anything in a certain time frame. I had to wait a year to get $11 in store credits, not even money I can deposit into a bank account like they originally told me. Even though I saw most of my items being sold in the app for a lot more than they sent me. Oh, and they don’t actually donate the clothes they can’t sell, they throw them away in a giant dumpster. :)",1
271,"Quality Decline: Thred Up used to be great! I am a long time customer and have spent my fair share of money here. Their return policy keeps getting more and more ridiculous. Thred Up used to be an affordable option that was accessible to people who didn’t want to shop in-store. Now, it is not affordable to try things on and return them. The prices are quiet high for used items, even comparing to ebay or other reselling sites for the same items. The measurements they provide are always off, making it nearly impossible to buy something and know it will fit correctly. They also removed their support number so there is no way to reach them if you have an issue. My order has been missing for three weeks, they have changed it so it is no longer returnable, I had to pay like $10 in shipping, and I have zero way of contacting them. I tried their online “support chat” and no one even responded. On top of this they collect way too much user data and private information. I would not recommend this company anymore.",1
272,"Happy but Sad: I have been hearing about Thred Up and wanted to try it, so decided today was the day. I wanted to add some cardigans to my inventory so picked out several. When it came time to pay I thought I could use my NEW 50% off first time user coupon. I put it in the “apply discount “ area, and was told it couldn’t be used on any of the items I wanted to buy. These are gently used items but the prices seem a little high still, especially on items with minor wear. Another point I would like to make is I couldn’t figure out how to easily delete an item from my cart. After I realized I couldn’t use my coupon, I was going to delete a couple of items as I really didn’t want to spend as much as I did. 

Hoping that the items I purchased will surpass my expectations and I will visit the site again and learn how to properly use the coupons!",5
273,"Shop Her Closet: I just noticed today the highlight to “Shop Her Closet” which featured Katie Couric and I cannot express how fun and beneficial this option is! I LOVE that 100% of the sales go to Stand Up to Cancer. I would love to see more features of celebrities/bloggers/style icons/etc. and results of sales benefiting non-profits. What an incredible way to drive sales and feel like you have a connection to a celebrity for example, and to be able to say “This was Katie Couric”s dress”. And obviously the main feature that it is consignment and is benefiting the planet by purchasing from ThredUP. Oh, AND benefiting cancer research and families struggling with unimaginable difficulties due to illnesses. Can I please put a plug in for non-profits that benefit pediatric cancer research (Alex’s Lemonade Stand for example)? Great feature ThredUP! Please consider continuing this. -Happy ThredUp customer since 2016",5
274,"Okay: ThredUP is just...okay. Not the best thing I’ve ever found and not the worst. It’s just so hit and miss as to what you are actually going to get verses what items look like/described as on the app. I literally just bought a necklace with no measurement that is so small it won’t even fit around my neck! It was not described as a choker, that would have been super helpful. So I just am frustrated at the inaccurate descriptions of items. Measurements are typically not accurate. Just ordered some Nike shorts for my daughter that were “like new!” but had a missing drawstring. It’s just not worth the hassle when there is so much uncertainty of what you are actually going to get. I did a clean out bag one time and was offered less than $5 for everything in my bag. Never again. I will say I did return an item that was marked not returnable because it was not as described and did get a refund. But geez. I don’t think I have ever kept everything in an order.  There is always an issue with something!",3
275,"I love thredUP!: I love this app so much! I care about the environment, and I didn’t want to shop at fast fashion brands, but my budget for clothes is in the smaller side, so I turned to thrifting! However, going to thrift stores is not always successful, especially during the pandemic, and that’s why I live thredUP so much!! You can use the filters to select exactly what you what almost every time! The clothes aren’t always the trendiest, but thanks true of any thrift store, and since this one has so much, a good percentage of the items here a good quality! Sometimes you have to search a bit, but in the end you end up with some really nice stuff! ThredUP also has a web version of this app, which is mostly the same, but I feel the app is a bit more concise. I have ordered from here so many times and will continue to!! Thanks for helping me help the environment, thredUP!",5
276,"Updates need to be made: I for the most part enjoy thredUP but there are definitely some updates that need to be done. For starters, let me search and better filter my favorites. I’m not sure why this isn’t an option already but I have a lot of favorites and I need to find specific clothing easily. I should be able to sort by category and color as well as have a search bar in my favorites section. My other problem is that over the past few days, the filtering system got worse. I don’t know if it’s a problem on my end but for example, when I search for dresses I no longer have the option to pick which occasion. When I search for jeans I no longer have the option to pick from light, medium, dark wash ect. nor can I do the filter option for the pant cut I’d like such as Flare, wide leg, straight leg ect. These problems are enough to make me delete the app. What’s the point of keeping a clothing app if i can’t find the cute options? I hope for an update soon.",2
277,"Use to love buying items.....: I use to love shopping off this app, and sometimes still do when I find a great deal. It’s getting harder and harder to spend my money here. There is no way I would spend 9.99 on tank tops from Costco, and this isn’t the only thing I find odd. Same things from Kmart I’m not paying 9.99 for used items from these places, when I can pay less at these locations directly. 

Whoever makes the decision on your pricing should reconsider what their marking these items at, or have someone Check the pricing. I love buying from ThreadUP, and it’s almost always for work, mostly tops. When you go Kmart, Walmart, target, Costco places like this where theses items are same price for the stuff I just purchased used. It’s a bummer. 

Please check your pricing it seems like the more popular you become the higher your prices go.",5
278,"Meh...use the web browser not the app.: I have been successful this far in receiving items as described. I only buy new and like new. Shipping items back was a learning curve. Definitely use their label to ship back, it’s cheaper. Though I think the restocking fee is a bit steep, I did the math and dealt with it. I didn’t have to pay for shipping to receive the items, so paying for them to go back I can deal with. I used to work at a thrift store so I can understand some of the thought process behind their decisions.
In a brick and mortar thrift store, usually you are unable to return the clothing. You only get store credit in extenuating circumstances, and exact exchanges are the norm. The difference is you get to try on while you’re there which helps.
What I like about ThredUP is the massive amount of clothing so I have a better chance of finding unique pieces in my size.
I’ve primarily used the browser-but decided to use the app and the discount that comes with using the app for the first time. I was disappointed that the check out process does not mirror the web browser’s process.
I couldn’t bundle my items to ship and the payment method had less options. I was very disappointed. If it hadn’t been for the 30% Discount, I wouldn’t have used the app at all or the payment method I had to choose.
Won’t be using the app anymore. Browser only for me. Nothing is ever perfect in life-it suits my needs for now.",3
279,"Be very careful!: I can’t figure out if the people running this company are being deceitful or if they’re just all ignorant morons. Ive bought multiple items from here and expect to have a bummer of a buy here and there, but not THIS MANY! And of course every wrong/ mislabeled/ unwearable item is final sale with no returns or refunds. Just a couple examples, I bought a medium size boys button up shirt from the kids section they have online and received a women’s button up top that even has the darting for breasts! I thought I just didn’t pay close enough attention so I double checked the paper and my email and it wasn’t my mistake at all. I ordered a boys youth small button up Dino print shirt. I received a size 4 in little kids! I bought Jean shorts for my daughter that had a huge hole in them where the belt loop was once actually attached as it should have been when I received it. Same kind of issues with bags; purses, shoes, and several more clothing items.  I’m not pleased that I’ve bought clothing for my 4 kids plus my husband and I that will never be worn by any of us. Just a Waste of money.",1
280,"Review: I really like Thred Ups customer service. Very prompt help. One thing I have noticed is that only a small amount of items stay in the “liked” or saved file, so when you go back to look thru the items you’re thinking of purchasing several of them are missing. Very inconvenient to have to scroll through all the items again to find the item you were thinking about purchasing. 

Also it would be nice to have a more detailed description of each item. For example 7 For All Mankind jeans would list the specific “style” name so we don’t have to scroll through thousands of items and still guess on whether or not it is the exact pair we were looking for. Just some suggestions to look at as you continue to improve your website. Thank you!",5
281,"Used to love: I used to love thredUP because I loved being able to get name brands at really great prices and then being able to sell my clothes as well. A lot of my work wardrobe is form thredUP. 
However, in the last few months they have really gone down hill. First, a package was lost and it took forever to even hear anything back from customer service and get a refund. Second, the fee to be able get a clean out bag is outrageous because there is no guarantee they will even take the items and then it’s an additional charge to have it shipped back. Third, they upped the restocking fee and I didn’t get a notification and only saw that it was more than it used to be when I ordered a few shirts and wanted to return them. 
All and all I will be taking my business elsewhere and if I want to sell my items I will do it myself or just donate to those in need. I can understand that the cost of doing business has increased but I don’t think the company has handled it well.",2
282,"Feed it good items☺️: ThredUP works well only if we feed it nice items. Pleeeease don’t send in old faded things that go for a dollar at goodwill. Ladies we are better than that. I’m tired of seeing ThredUP having to try to sell junk. Why even send in items that have fading, pilling, stains? I’ve gotten like-new wonderful items that I use frequently.  They didn’t work for the original owner for whatever reason but for me they are super. I’m sending in all the new, clean & like new leggings & tops we have clogging up our dresser drawers & closets. I don’t expect to make lots of $$$ but I do expect in return to continue to find treasures at ThredUP!  
Please understand that this is like a club & the members own the privilege of getting good deals only if we honor sending in good items.  Stop sending old worn out things. The consignment only policy is because some of you send in junk.",5
283,"Good but could use improvement: I really wish you guys used more keywords. I’d love to find a top with a lemon print and I’d like to be able to just search “lemon” and find it. I found a shirt on ThredUP  with cacti all over it. I know someone is gonna love that shirt but they will never be able to find it with the current system. Other descriptors would be great too such as gingham or ombré. It would also be great if searching for two colors in an item were possible. 
I’d like to be able to find a black and red polka dot shirt by being able to search for black & red. I get so tired of searching through a sea of stuff I don’t want, that I have to quit. I haven’t been back on ThredUP in months. I know you guys have great stuff, but I just don’t have to time or the patience to sift through the rest. Seriously-_- you guys revamped the rewards system but not the search engine.",4
284,"The only place I shop: I love ThredUP, as do so many others. Rather than repeating the praise I’ve seen here, I’ll share some things I’ve learned. If you’re overseas using an APO, you can purchase items “from my home warehouse” (under Ways to Shop) and then return what doesn’t fit. This is currently the only way to shop ThredUP overseas. Use points to waive restocking fees, and order over the threshold to get free shipping. 

I wish the filters allowed for more specificity. I wish that rather than only searching for brands I could also search “jean jacket” or “black jean jacket”. I wish the sizing (especially on pants) were more consistent. Sometimes the thumbnail shows one waist size, while the larger description shows another. 

Even with these flaws, this app is amazing and well worth a download. I shop here regularly, and will probably never shop “the old way” again.",4
285,"I’m not sure anymore: I’ve been buying from ThredUP for the last few years and at first they were amazing. The sizes and measurements were accurate, the quality was exactly as described, I’d get the item in the exact condition that was advertised, etc. But now? I find that the service is getting worse. First, they’re sizing used to be pretty much dead on accurate but the last few months, the items I order have the measurements way off and I’ve seen items that I knew weren’t the size they indicated. Second, in my last order someone didn’t include the shoes I bought in my package so I never got them and they told me it’s basically gone and I won’t be getting them. They did say they’d refund me the money, but I wanted the shoes! Someone obviously dropped the ball and I got screwed. They’re customer service department takes forever to get back with you too. I don’t know. I love ThredUP but they’re not exactly up to par like they used to be. It’s very disappointing",3
286,"When it is good...: ThredUp experiences growing pains like every other business. While their customer service team appears inundated/non responsive at times, when I have made human contact, the results have been positive. I support ThredUP’s ideals since they dovetail my own- to reduce landfill waste by keeping good clothes in circulation, bring worthwhile employment to regions that need it, and allow those of us who wish for the finer things in life, a chance to enjoy them at affordable prices. For all that I will put up with occasional frustration and inconvenience. For now. As long as a ThredUP keeps serving their customers and staffers, they have my loyalty and my business.

Update: a ThredUP customer for 11 years bc this company still provides a quality shopping experience. I turn to ThredUP for clothing before I shop anywhere else!",5
287,"Make sure you get the Return Assurance!: Sent in a HUGE bag of clothes in, and when my bag was processed three of the higher end items were noticeably absent from being processed. I emailed customer service and got a very generic message about “minor flaws” and that because I didn’t do their Return Assurance, the items were recycled. Yes, I realize the fault is mine here for not understanding the policy, but I have a strong feeling the items in question that were not accepted are actually now in one of their processing agent’s closets and not responsibly recycled as I was assured. Planning to cash out the items that actually were accepted and never use this app again. Better off doing the legwork yourself and using another resale app!!!!!!

UPDATE: I got a developer response from thredUP that was, word for word, the exact generic, vague, non-specific answer that I already received from emailing customer service. If your employees are responsible for what they accept, how are they not responsible for what isn’t?? Such a sour taste in my mouth, not to mention the money that I’m now out for my luxe items that weren’t accepted.",1
288,"Used to be so much better: Pricing has gone significantly up, in addition to restocking fees, making the costs less competitive. Recent payouts on the other hand have gone way down, so either they are just pocketing it all or overhead has become too much. Further operations are inefficient and ironically not all that green considering being a second hand retailer- multiple packages are shipped from all different distribution locations adding transportation and packaging.
Lastly, and this is my biggest frustration is that repeatedly (over  ten times now, product does not match the description- twice I have ordered toddler clothes only to receive a woman’s size item resembling the same, while yet other times it’s the opposite, and brand names not correctly loaded, but yet each of these items have been returned with reason appropriately noted only to find same item appears back in my feed still wrong. Please pay more attention when loaded and most importantly listen to your customers and fix errors before restocking so it doesn’t become another persons aggravation as well.",1
289,"Love the app but one thing is really irritating: I really love the app. I’ve never had to return anything, everything always came as expected and when it said it was supposed to come. I love being able to find super cute clothing items for pretty cheap. But the one thing that REALLY irritates me is that there isn’t a limit on how many times someone can re-add an item to their cart. Because I’ll find something and it’ll already be in someone’s cart and then day after day they will just keep re-adding it and never buy it when I’m sitting here actually wanting to buy it! If you can’t buy it then don’t add it to your cart, especially if you’re not ever planning on buying it! But if you’re planning on actually buying the item but maybe don’t have the money I’d say like a 3 day limit or so, maybe even like a week would be okay. And then you shouldn’t be able to add it back into your cart for a full day so someone who actually wants to buy it can instead.",3
290,"Mostly great: I really love this model, as I prefer to lessen my environmental impact by purchasing pre-owned.  It also offsets my expensive taste.  I have not yet done a closet clean out, so I can’t speak to the experience of selling with ThredUp.   I knocked off a star because the photos are lacking (especially with black items, it is hard to see the details), and the descriptions don’t supply enough information.  As a another reviewer mentioned, if a stain or wear is noted, it would be helpful to have a photo to inform whether it is something you can live with or not.   I’m interested in an item that is listed as black and blue, but I can’t tell what part is blue from the photo, and the description doesn’t say.  So, increased detail and better lighting for photos would make a world of improvement.  Other than that, love it.",5
291,"Good Stuff: I really like ThredUP, I’ve used them for years. I’ve sold and bought and the experience is always good and easy. I have noticed when buying it is very important to look at all the details of the item closely: Size, material, condition, etc. For obviously reasons, the pictures don’t show the whole story. Measurements can be helpful too, because there have been a few times the item was quite a bit different than the image, but that’s on me. I do also wish there were a few more search categories. Especially for trendier styles, it can be a bit hard to narrow down the search because certain search words (like crochet) don’t yield many results. Overall, I think it’s the best online service for feeling like you are shopping retail, while buying second hand.",5
292,"I love this app and way of thrifting!: I’m in love with Thred Up. I pretty much have a constant revolving door of clothes and I’m consigning and clothes I’m buying. I found a designer dress I fell in love with but couldn’t justify the price tag for Easter. On ThredUP you can save searches of brands (and sizes) that you love and low and behold- the dress appeared IN MY SIZE for $8.99. I was thrilled. It’s wonderful to hunt and shop for the perfect piece. I tell all my friends! 
My only recommendation is that the web based version has a “find similar” feature as well as a “size up/down” feature that allows you to find an even better deal, or something new with tags on something you’ve saved. It also allows you to search for a different size- so that you get a perfect fit based on the measurements. I wish the app had that feature.",5
293,"Great finds! Love this app!: I can’t write enough positivity about this company and app. It is so much easier than other selling/buying apps. Considering all I have to do is send them my clothing and they do the rest; I am happy with the payouts I am receiving. If I am consigning clothing, I make sure to try and keep everything I’m sending in season and if I need to recycle something I know they will do it responsibly and respectfully. I am slowly buying and selling through their app to up my wardrobe for classic and higher end pieces that are sure to last. They offer multiple shipping and return options, but be sure to research and pick which one fits your needs. With second hand clothing becoming more popular and eco-conscious I am sure I’ll not only be able to make extra cash, but look good while doing it!

I just wish they would expand into men’s clothing!",5
294,"Pain: I literally regret selling my clothes from this app if I could rate it lower, so low that it drives them out of business I would, i hope none of you make the same mistake that I did...I sent SO MANY clothes, possible up to 50 items in good shape, only to have them accept 8 of those items???!? And not even that, I was scammed with instead of getting actual money, they used the money that i earned from those few clothes, for a gift card to an expensive website called formation or whatever, WHICH I COULDN’T EVEN GET ANYTHING FROM THERE BECAUSE PRICES RANGE FROM $30-50!!! AND THE SAD PART IS...the sad part is is that the money was useless because it ended up expiring, the gift card ended up expiring so now I’m left with nothing, no money, nothing to pay bills. I hope this company gets whats coming to them because that is just messed up. I’m just going to delete the app and cry myself to sleep like usual, I hope none of you make the same mistake I did because now I’m in debt and in pain, thinking that I would get a good pay of money, only to be scammed...i only feel pain..so much pain",1
295,"Addicted: So I was skeptical at first, just because I haven’t had great experiences with online clothing stores before (size was too small or too big, pattern looked off in person, etc) but honestly I’ve had two ThredUP boxes mailed to me so far and for the most part I love it. Especially with used clothing, I thought they’d come in looking shabby but they looked pretty new to me. The sizing fit pretty well, all came in this cute box neatly folded. For the price, I saved more with ThredUP than I would shopping at a thrift store and I found more items here (ordered 20 tops) than I would at a store used or new. I’m addicted and placing my next order. Satisfies my shopping fix without going over budget at all. I love this store! I usually buy my clothes for the most part new, but I think I’ll be using ThredUP more often.",5
296,"Inconsistent: Overall, I like ThredUP as a concept and I do think it’s fun to “hunt” for quality pieces on this site. But my experience with the clothes I’ve gotten have been really inconsistent - I’ve had some really good finds at fabulous prices, but I’ve also had too many subpar experiences such as: broken zipper, wrong brand, pants that are marked as a 4 but have shrunk to an equivalent of size 0, a polyester shirt listed as silk, a *clearly* used wallet listed as brand new... the list goes on and on. I’ve sent back about 50% of the items I’ve ordered because of these secondhand quality control issues, and it gets tiring to deal with returns all the time. Of course, some items are final sale and it’s really frustrating when the item that I receive is in a condition that I would even feel bad donating to Goodwill. I’ll continue to shop with ThredUP (and stick to returnable items from now on), but I do feel like I’m taking a gamble every time I’m ordering things off of this site.",3
297,Where is the rest of my bag!: Up until now I have had minor complaints about Thred Up.  Overall it takes 45 days from the time you ship your bag for them to actually process it.  Ok.  I get it.  They are busy.  But this time I sent at least 6 Elie Tahari dresses that were practically brand new.  In fact most has just been dry cleaned.  I just got my bag processed.  Two items were accepted?  Where did the rest of my clothes go?  This is thousands of dollars worth of clothing. GONE.  And they are in better or the same shape as the other items I have sent in before.  I seriously believe they are stealing these clothes and wither keeping for themselves or selling elsewhere for a profit.  I will be tracking other sites but know it is probably fruitless. BEWARE!  if you don’t want to get ripped off don’t send anything to Thredup other than stuff that has little value.  I wonder if there are enough other issues like this that we can open a formal complaint or look at a class action suit?  I am sure I am just one of thousands who have had this happen.  Thred Up you need to make this right.,1
298,"Great Prices, Not So Great Service: I got an awesome dress and blazer for a steal on thredUP and paid extra for expedited (2-3 days) shipping so it would arrive with enough time to get it cleaned and pressed before an upcoming job interview. It’s been 5 days and I’ve not received my package but things I ordered two days ago with standard shipping from another store are already here. How does that work? I get that it’s holiday season, but don’t tell someone they’re gonna get their package on the 28th only to find the tracker now says it won’t arrive until January 2. What did I pay extra for then? I tried contacting customer service about this but have heard nothing back. Like I said: great prices, not so great service.

Update: I had reached out to customer support using their in-app chat on Saturday December 30. It’s Wednesday January 3 and I’ve received zero response. I did get my package on the 2nd, but the fact remains that I didn’t receive it within the 2-3 days I paid for and customer service is unresponsive. Love the clothes, not thrilled with the service.",2
299,"Just Can’t Get Enough of ThredUP!: I will admit I was skeptic when I placed my first order one year ago, but once my packages were delivered and I opened my box, I was extremely pleased! I have done all my clothes and shoes shopping on this app for over a year. I have a weakness for designer labels, mainly because I love the tailored fit. To say that I’ve saved thousands of dollars just buying from ThredUP is NOT an exaggeration. I’ve bought brand new leather boots, leather jackets, shoes, dresses, that still had tags attached. I’ve updated my wardrobe and I’m so very pleased with my clothing. Now and then the sizing was a bit off, but it’s the label not ThredUP. Once you know which brands run in smaller sizes, you can just filter your new sizes and voila! You are back on track. I love the reward points, too. ThredUP, you’ve got a loyal customer for life!😍",5
300,"Evolution: I discovered ThredUP a few years ago and was addicted for the first year, but then there were changes that were more about pricing and returns that turned me off for many months. But ThredUP has appeared to found a way to meet us customers partway and I’m happy with the changes. Loyalty points are an example of this- being able to use them for restocking fees is fair (restocking fees were a big reason I stepped away). Prices can still vary widely but sellers are allowed to set their own prices which I assume is the reason for this. I don’t sell clothes through ThredUP anymore bc it always was a letdown - they should explain why items aren’t accepted. The app is easy to navigate which has been the case since the start. I’m just glad to see more good deals that brought me here in the first place.",5
301,"Like it: I like ordering from here, the clothes are in great shape and they have an amazing selection. I do think some things are over priced for being used and measurements are usually off so beware of that. I only order from places I know my size in. And sometimes they mark things the wrong size or the with the wrong label. I ordered an express dress but when it came it was from forever 21. I think I overpaid for it since express is better quality and more expensive than forever 21 but I wasn’t going to pay to return it when it wasn’t my fault they mislabeled it. The picture quality for a lot of the items could be better too. More things would sell if you could actually see it better or it wasn’t wrinkled. That’s the reasons I gave it 3 stars. I’ve been ordering a lot from here but will stop because of the mis label I got today.",4
302,"Great for shopping but.....: As a shopper, ThredUP has been 5 stars!  Great brands, great quality, great prices.  And shopping for my three daughters from home makes life infinitely easier.

The selling process is in need of some work.  I have made 3 attempts to send in full bags.  The first one my pay out was only .91 despite countless items with tags still on and a $400 leather jacket that I had never worn.  The second one I sent in two months ago and still have not heard back regarding a credit or anything at all.  And my final attempt was denied bc they are not currently taking clean outs.

All of this said, I've had to reach out to customer service a couple of times and they have been wonderful.  Accessible and helpful.  And really this is the most important thing.  I feel appreciated.  I def recommend this site.  Especially for busy moms on a budget.",5
303,"So far so good. A couple of things...: I don’t have much to complain about yet. Except, shipping seems to take a little while to get here. After getting a few more packages, I will come back.  
Oh, the measurements tend to be different. Even if it is the same size. The Description says how you measure stuff, but some items are clearly not measured that way. Some look to be measured across, some around etc. Makes it hard to judge. However, as long as womens sizes and junior sizes are in fact separated properly, that part should be ok for me. 
I don’t think I will try to sell with them. They have a list of does and don’ts but I see “don’ts” in the “condition” areas. Which means, you do sell less the perfect stuff. And, the money you get back isn’t really worth it. Donate to them, sell your own.
I am expecting a few items now, so, I will be back to review again.
Lots of cutes stuff at good prices. I love that part!",4
304,"Disappointed Seller Happy Buyer: Selling Review - they took away their option to select an automatic cash out option for the items they take. The first two times I sold I was able to get paid upfront without my items selling first. Third time I sold I thought it would be same process. This is how I learned I could only consign after I sent my bag in. One of my items sold where the customer used a coupon and that savings was discounted from my payout. From now on I will only sell items that I’ve tried selling else where before sending in to Thredup. Not happy at all. 

Buyer Review - has been hit or miss. I have found more luck in buying tops. I absolutely love buying name brand athletic pants - huge savings and the quality is always like new. Pants on the hand never fit right - I always end up returning. Outside of a small return fee the process is pretty easy. I love the surprise goody boxes - I always find at least one item to keep and it’s a great deal!",3
305,"Nope: So, while the quality of the clothing is hit or miss and a review could o let be generic, I’m giving thred-up 1 star for their service.

I’ve had at least 2 orders disappear completely in shipping, or take way too long to arrive, and it took several weeks to get anyone to respond as to what happened or a refund.

When they did, they had promised a credit in the amount of expedited shipping so that my next order would arrive faster due to my shipping issues, BUT when the credit never showed up and I emailed customer service, the app didn’t send a push notification and I wasn’t made aware someone had even addressed my issue. IT SAT UNANSWERED. No red icon, no email notification. They don’t send messages back immediately, so checking the app every 2 hours to see if someone responds is ridiculous.

Which, might I add, they actually didn’t even fix the missing credit, it took days for them to simply ask a question they could answer themselves if they looked at the order history, but, alas they just asked me why I thought I’d have a credit.

However- I find it ironic that they can email me 5 times a day about useless sales and media, but can’t send me an email regarding money they actually owe me. Real convenient.

So, I won’t be spending anymore money on this app.",5
306,"Can be great if you know what to watch for: I am a repeat Thredup customer and have gotten some great deals.  As with all on-line shopping, read descriptions carefully, as they sell some items with stains and other imperfections that may not be easily fixed.  Good luck if you want to buy suits, as they have no such category and I have noticed that they split the pieces and list them separately, which can make it impossible to tell which pieces have matching pieces and which are just separates.  Also, some of the prices are crazy.  Check eBay before you buy here, and you will often find a better price.  On the plus side, the selection on Thredup is huge, many prices are great, and you can find great surprises at times.  Their shipping charges are reasonable (zero, if your order totals $79 or more, and you can even gather purchases over 7 days to reach that level).  Overall, Thredup is a good place to shop.",4
307,"Cringey: That’s what retail prices are! Cringey. I used to bargain shop, and never paid full price. But this is a whole new world of thrifting.  I lost a lot of weight and ThredUp allowed me refurbish my wardrobe with great brands, and very little money. I love filling my heart list , and watching the prices fall. I shop the clearance and petite sale sections, shopping for my favorite brands. 
Would I ever pay 250 bucks for a pair of rag and bone jeans? Never! But I get like new ones here for 10 bucks. 
I wish there were better photos of items. Even a pic of the clothing tag might be helpful. Listing will describe “ small stain”  I would have to see a picture to see if it is relevant to me. Nope, not here. No pics. 
Some items could use more than 2 pics, honestly.
I have enjoyed all of my purchases, and will continue shopping here.",5
308,"You can’t coast on being a cheap option for clothes shopping forever: I love this app. I love the affordable options it has for clothes. I love the convenience of being able to send my clothes in and save my favorites when buying. But it needs to do better. Right now, it feels disorganized. A recent example to give: I am looking for a blouse with a sweetheart neckline. When using the search bar, and filtering by the tag ‘neckline: sweetheart’ it gives me search results that are NOT accurate. Blouses with square neck, V-neck, scoop neck, yet all of these shirts were sorted as ‘sweetheart neckline’. I am not the only one who has dealt with this problem. There are multiple stories of women who bought clothes that were listed as the wrong size, the wrong brand, even the wrong fabric. This is just flat out lazy. This is an thrifting/upcycle clothing app. No one is expecting a boutique experience. But for goodness sake, at least do the bare minimum in making sure your product information is correct.",2
309,"Adequate for shopping- Garbage for selling: They have less clothing options available than other resale sites like Poshmark or Depop, but what they lack in range they make up for in dirt cheap prices. Unfortunately these dirt cheap prices also translate to no money sent back to the sellers. 

Even if you send them high-quality clothes, you’re only likely to see pennies on the dollar for those items. I sent in brands like J. Crew and Anthro, and am expecting to see between 2-5$ profit on each item. That’s before they take out the clean-out kit fees too. Clothes also have to be sold within a certain window or you receive nothing: meaning the site, while touting its environmentally-friendly impact, dramatically favors trendy/fast-fashion type clothing. In effect ThreadUp is less a resale system and more a digital good will.

I will say, that it’s most redeeming feature is it’s convenience. Taking your clothes to an actual donation site is a huge pain. Their closet clean out kits reduce that.",2
310,"Pictures are deceiving: The pictures online are deceiving. I ordered a crossbody purse, which was cute online. And the description said it was in excellent condition, you’ll mistake it for brand new…not! When I received it, the corners were faded and on other areas too. Also the strap looked worn. Needless to say I was disappointed, and this item couldn’t be returned. I have also sent in a clean out bag with several nice things. 15 of those things were excepted and listed, 3 of them weren’t. I emailed thredup to question why? They’re reason was because of excessive wear, what?? Both pairs of shoes I wore once, still looked new and the jeans I never wore still had the tags on them. I was flabbergasted, now I feel like I’ve been taken advantage off! Once my things have sold, I will not be using Thredup any longer.",5
311,"Great for buyers, bad for sellers: I’ll be quick - it’s a terrible place to sell your clothes. You’ll end up with minimal sale income if at all, less than you’d get at a yard sale. But buying?! Have a ball!!! I have nearly 30 items from my wardrobe off this app. It’s a great place to find and buy designer clothes at a steep discount. Having a place to save searches really helps me find unique items from brands I love really quickly. And they’re always running sales. Web descriptions could use some work - they’re frequently inaccurate or missing key information (like waist measurement). If you’re used to the detailed experience on Poshmark, you’ll feel the absence of it here. But returns are easy, if you don’t mind restocking fees and getting store credit in return. Most all the items I’ve received were clean and in the condition listed online.",4
312,4/5: It’s a great and easy way to thrift shop. You can filter what quality and cost of clothes you’re looking for and you can find some really beautiful and unique pieces. My downsides to it is that it’s taken me 2 1/2 weeks to receive my packages living in Sacramento and if you want to return a piece then it takes off a $1-$3 stocking fee per piece and if you want it refunded to your card then you pay ~$8 shipping fee but if you go for store credit then shipping back is free. Most of the clothes that I’ve purchased have been perfect but I’ve had one piece so far that was of really poor quality (even though it was brand new with tags) and it was easy to poke holes through it with your finger with little pressure. It’s a great huge discount store but just be certain with the pieces you’re buying.,5
313,"True sizing: I total LOVE this site.  I do have a problem with some things though.  I pretty much order an 18 which I think might be a 2x.  When people are receiving the clothes in, I don’t think they are necessarily checking the clothing.  I got a 2x but it clearly is like a size 8.  Just because it is 2x doesn’t mean it should go into that category.  As you know, things coming from china, the sizes are not what we call it.  European might be the same.  My point is, people sorting the clothing should check that a 2x is literally a 2x not a size 6.  Now, I have to either give it away again for the third time or spend the money to return it.  It would also be helpful if there were more in the description like, zipper or buttons on pants or skirts that you can not see well enough in the pictures.",5
314,"Overall amazing, but a few hiccups: I’ve used thredUP for a while and for the most part I haven’t gotten great clothes for both myself and my toddler daughter. The prices are great and the clothes look mostly brand new. A couple times I did get clothes that were not the right size, both for me and my daughter. I ordered something advertised as size 2 that came a size 7 for her. And something an XL for myself that when it came was obviously an XL in children’s. But returns is a pretty easy process (if the item is eligible for return). As with anything second hand, you also need to make sure you wash it. I have found things in the children’s clothes’ pockets that made it obvious it had not been previously washed. But it’s super easy and have been very happy WAY more than disappointed, and they have sales pretty often, so if you keep an eye out for those, you can get an extra discount.",4
315,"Adore this Company!!: I love that there is an option to purchase gently used clothing and to have the bundle feature. It doesn’t break the bank and if I get tired of it I can pass on and not feel guilty.  They package and ship these items with care and it shows. I am always so excited when I see the green polka dots at my door!!!
I would say two things that drive me crazy is the lack of communication when you reach out to customer service on the app. 
The other thing I submitted as feedback is to be able to enter your dimensions in your “sizes” so your search is better. As we all know vendors fit completely different. In some I’m a med. and some an xl.  Would reduce wasted time looking at items that just won’t fit me or my children. 
Two last things that would be great moving forward: the length of belts and if a garnet has pockets. 
Thank you for being great and doing great for our planet.",4
316,"It’s almost perfect!!: I’m using the site to find both trendy weekend wear, and build a much nicer work wardrobe. Actually used the goody box service for the 9-5 option, and they knocked it out of the park. I only had to return a few items due to fit.  I will say I have had two experiences where the item received was clearly midsized, shrunken, or something was way wrong. It was visibly maybe a 2 or 4 not a 12. These were $3.99 final sale items, so I just donated them. Also, when I’m shopping for work wear, suits in particular, it would be great if you could list an entire suit together, if it comes in that way. It is hard to discern from the photo what will match. Now I have several jackets that were described as grey wool, neither match the skirt that said gray wool, and I’m sort of anal about wearing mismatched pieces. I want to look more professional, not thrown together. But those are my only complaints.",4
317,"THREDTABULOUS: I came across, purchased from, and fell in love with thredUp three years ago.  Since then I have never purchased clothing from another place for three reasons; their quality of clothing, the outstandingly affordable pricing, and the absolute ease of shopping.

I am a teacher and need to dress semi-professional five days a week.  My closet is filled (stuffed) with top name brand dresses.  I receive compliments on my clothing every day.  My favorite part of thredUP is how comprehensive the description is.  I love, love, love that they tell you what the hem line is and that you can refine your searches to a hem line!  It saves me so much time shopping and pretty much no need to make returns.  ThredUp is a teachers dream, delivering top quality clothing, at a fraction of the cost, right to your front door.  Who could ask for more?

I only gave them four stars, instead of five, because they raised the purchase limit in order to receive free shipping.",4
318,"Do not send your Designer Things: I started sending my designer clothes, shoes, boots and jewelry to thred up and at first I received good money! The last two bags I sent them... they did not give me anything for my Hunter Boots (Pink)a pair of my LV heels, Cole Hann slip on driver Mocs brand new, Lu lu Mon skirt new, a brand new pair of Gorgeous Designer Platform Wedge Sandals (Made in Italy) and a pair of Italian leather boots gently worn, a Michael  Korrs Tote I carried half a season, a one of a kind handmade gold outfit that was made at The Greenbrier Hotel by one of their Seamstresses in house...more things that are just GONE! I did not donate these items these were to be sold! I took pictures of my things before I sent them but they won’t answer any emails I send or answer my messages when I call!!! What they are doing is illegal!! I believe the employees are going through the bags and keeping what they want and sending the rest to be listed because when you send 20 things in a bag and only 3 things are kept to be listed something is wrong and I’m reporting this business to the BBB! And as a Retired Paralegal from the Supreme Court of Appeals they will listen to me!!",1
319,"Do not sell to this company: I don’t get how this company is still in business and with such high ratings. I guess it’s because people BUYING from them are all super happy. But do you know why they sell things so reasonably priced? They paid NOTHING for it! I used this service years ago. The first time was good but after that it was nothing but a scam. Steals perfect clothes claiming not good enough yet sells them on their site for a good chunk of change. Pretty sure I had a new with tags item “rejected” even or if they did pay, they paid next to nothing. At least now the ads have enough sense to say “a little cash” cause frankly you’ll be lucky to get even a little. Now they do this bag thing so then don’t even tell you up front what you may get because they know they aren’t honoring it anyway. Used to they would quote you a price but they always lied and didn’t actually pay it out. Do not sell... and frankly if you buy, you’re only getting a good deal because someone else got ripped off. Wonderful concept but theadup doesn’t deliver what it promises to those who want to sell.",1
320,"ThredUP website has a problem: I was trying to find a short sleeve green top of a certain color.  So I went through about 60 pages and saved several on my favorites page. The website restarted itself so I lost all those “favorites” I had chosen. I went through the whole process again. Again, I had to sign in, record my sizes and designers, that I was looking for the green tops and pick out the green tops of a certain color out of all the green tops I was given to choose from!  I did not even find all of the green tops that I did the first time. I gave up after a while. Again, went to check my favorites to see if the tops I had saved were on my favorites page. Some were, most weren’t. 
I have never had this problem with ThredUP. You need to get this fixed!

321,"Terrible Experience: I purchased with a VISA, instead they charged a very old AMEX that had been replaced due to fraud. I never provided any updated AMEX info in my account. In fact, I put the AMEX on hiatus and froze for use. But somehow my transaction a one-time purchas was viewed as a subscription (like Netflix) and AMEX  paid despite the fact I provided Thredup a VISA to charge. I am disputing the charge as unauthorized with AMEX and requested Thredup to reverse the charge there and put on my VISA as originally requested. In fact they can easily charge my VISA, watch it post and then reverse the AMEX. Yet, was told by customer service on chat they would have to email someone to look into this and follow up with me. I asked to be copied on that communication they said no. It’s been several days no update. I have no ticket number to follow up. I find it frustrating to have to continue to check in on status of this. This is not my first issue with Thredup, but this will be my last transaction with this business.",2
322,"Customer service needs overhaul where’s my stuff?: I requested 2 bags, a clean out and a sell. The bags both came at the same time and there was no information which bag was clean out or sell. Both bags look exactly the same and are NOT marked or come with any information about what kind they are. I made the mistake of sending them out. I chatted with customer service and they agreed to send the bags back so I could begin the process again. I only got 1 bag back and now customer service is not responding to my chats. I’m going to wait a few days to see if they respond through email and take responsibility for the lost package. If not, I will be making a complaint to the better business bureau....especially after reading all these other horror stories. 
Wow....I usually do my due diligence in researching services. I certainly will NOT be lax again. 
I will NOT be using this app! I realize we are going through tough times, but that doesn’t excuse you from not responding at all. Even an automated message explaining wait time would be better than nothing.",1
323,"Disappointed: I have sent clothes and bought clothes from ThredUP for quite some time now. I used to enjoy sending my bag and looking online for great deals. It seems lately customer service has rapidly declined. The last bag I sent had many good items and I received a total of 2.27 in “credit” for it. It wasn’t much for the size bag I sent. The next bag I sent was declined completely for an “odor”. I take really good care of my clothes and purchase often. What a disappointment to say none of my clothes were worthy of you giving me the few CENTS that you do for each item. 
Then I was enjoying the opportunity to bundle items and use ASSURE to make a couple of payments for several items. Now that’s gone. I probably will be too soon. No more purchasing or selling because clearly my items and myself are not appreciated.",5
324,"TERRIBLE Customer Service: I made an order last night, and realized I had accidentally left an old address as the shipping address. I have been trying to cancel my order so that the item does not get shipped since it’s currently in processing. This should be simple, however, Threadup has ZERO customer support. They do not have a phone number you can call and only communicate through email. I received an email back saying they were experiencing high volumes of inquiries and that they would get back to me in a week... so basically I won’t be able to easily resolve this silly issue. I’m extremely frustrated and don’t see myself using the site in the future if this problem isn’t solved. Which is unfortunate because I have sent and bought clothing through Threadup and had  previous positive experiences. I would not recommend Threadup to any one currently due to their poor customer service. I will update my review if this issue is resolved.",3
325,"The only place I shop!: Have been extremely happy with the purchases from ThredUp. Love the convenience of having delivery to my front door along with the simplicity of returns. The quality descriptions and reasonable pricing make it so easy to shop those high end brands I love. Such great desks! Customer service has been very responsive with any questions and accommodating when I had concerns.  It’s really the main site I shop for all my clothing and handbag needs/desires
I also have been a seller with ThredUP as well and although the process of sending in a bag and getting items priced was a little lengthy in the end the pricing was fair and it felt great to refresh my wardrobe knowing someone else would give my gently used clothes a second life!
The website is easy to navigate and keeps improving over time. Keep up the great service!",5
326,"Works well: I love ThredUp, and I've been a regular shopper for years, but I've only started using the app in the past few months. It works well – I find it faster and easier to use than the thredUP website. 

The only quibble I have is that for whatever reason the app logs me out pretty often (which the website did not), and takes me to the ""sign up now to get promotions and save 10%!"" page. So I'll have to go open my password manager and find my password and login again just a glance at an item, see a promotion I got an email about, etc. I wish either that it would keep me longer longer, or that you have the option to view items and pages without logging in except when you are submitting an order.

But that's a minor detail. Great app overall.",5
327,"LOVE this app/company!!!: I am someone who always tries to be an informed consumer and an environmentally friendly person. I try to buy local, small business, I carry bamboo cutlery, a cloth napkin, reusable water bottle and coffee mug, reusable straw, and reusable shopping bag everywhere with me. 

To be able to shop used clothing on such an extensive level is a game changer. I haven’t been to a regular store in months. I’ve developed a skill at picking clothes that I know will fit well. People compliment me on my ThreadUp purchases all the time! 

I can not recommend this app/company enough. I’ve done a clean-out bag, which is the easiest thing ever [they send bag- you fill bag- it’s pre-paid so drop it off- done]. I’ve bought tons of stuff and had to return some things- also very easy!! I recommend this app all the time and I can’t say enough amazing things about it!!",5
328,"Consistently damaged items: I have bought from here many times and always get my hopes up. They do some tricks with photos that really don’t show what the clothes look like. Every time I’ve bought from here at least one or two items is really damaged to the point where I don’t understand how they can resell it. Sure they refund the restocking fee for damaged items but you have to pay for return shipping which is at least $9. I’ve received items with big stains, threads coming out all over the place, and stuff that was see-through when it didn’t look see-through in the picture. “Like new” means there is probably some flaw like pilling. They don’t describe items well enough, for example: it doesn’t say if something has a built-in bra. Their app also doesn’t work correctly for promos like their bingo. It’s unfortunate because it’s a good idea but they take advantage of people who want to do the right thing by buying used. Go to your local thrift store instead, you’ll know what you’re getting.",1
329,"Fun to shop.. sizes mislabeled: I have sent hundreds of items to thread up and only about half of them actually get listed. And the majority of items are good quality and good condition and still do not get listed. That gets frustrating, especially when I would have rather just kept the item. I have also ordered lots of items. MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT MEASUREMENTS. Sizes are mislabeled often. Unfortunately not everything is measured. I just sent something back that had the wrong size and there it is back up on the site with the wrong size again. They tried to charge a restocking fee for the wrong size and had to contact them to drop the fee. The great part about thred up is that you can cash in your money from selling to purchase new clothes! It will take a while to build up your balance (you make only a small amount on items), but once you do, it’s fun to spend it on new clothes!",3
330,"Overall Satisfied with the App and ThredUp: I’ve purchased several items from ThredUp and overall and very happy with my experience. 
I think the app is very easy to use and even receiving the emails are nice to see “what’s new” to the store. I am giving it a 4 for two reasons. 
1. I think their shipping turn around is way too lengthy. They ship from GA, IL, and AZ. I am on the east coast and completely understand that items from AZ will take a little longer than a shipment from GA. My biggest issue is that it can take up to 48-72hrs for an item to actual be put into a bag and shipped. Which then prolongs the shipping transit time. It shouldn’t take almost a week to ship from GA to SC. 
2. My “Complaint” would be in the item description area. It would be nice to know how the clothes are manufactured. Yes we get the type of thread like polyester, spandex, ect.. but is it knitted or a spun material? I’ve purchased a few items not realizing that it was more of a knitted polyester thinking it would be a cute summer outfit. You can’t wear a sweater type dress in the dead of summer in the south. Just won’t end well after 10 min. Not a huge deal but going to have to wait until fall or winter to wear the item.

But all in all very happy with the items I have purchased. I have recommended ThredUp to several people as I enjoy “shopping” in a friends closet.",4
331,"More bang for the buck!: I am getting top notched clothing at a bargain price! I buy only organic material, cotton, silk, wool etc. I also buy ‘new with tags’ or ‘like new’. I haven’t been in a mall or brick & mortar store since. Where in the world can one sit comfortable at home and choose from hundreds of styles and designer labels? You have it at your finger tips, ThreadUp! 
There are some changes I’d like to see. . . . mention if a dress or skirt has pockets. Sleeves are another concern, give the measurements, plain sleeves, like no cuff, just hemmed, no bother, but cuff wrists are more difficult to shorten, unless one takes the sleeves completely out and alter it from the shoulder, can be done, but not by everyone!
As mentioned previously, please elaborate on ‘where the stain is’. 
On some fabric the stain can be removed. So another item can be reused.

332,"Search functionality is mixed: I’ve never used a shopping app that has such a stunted experience compared to the web version. There is a lot of promise, but the search functionality seems to change weekly. In the web version it is easy to drill down and specify your search no matter what screen you enter the search from. In the app there are different search functions depending which screen you enter the search from. There is also no linked brands on an object page to easily navigate to other items available by that brand, like there is on the website.  The search functions are much less intuitive in the app than the web version.  

Notifications have stopped working for me lately, so I’ve missed sales and items I have been watching to become available. 

One thing that is not specific to the app is the lack of detailed sizing information, like the actual waist measurement of a skirt, makes it hard to shop for things that will fit across brand sizes. It makes me much more hesitant to buy something, never mind the waste of resources, money, and time for thredUP employees to process returns. 

Overall a mixed experience for me, as I love the search functions of other shopping apps, like EBay which allows for Boolean operators and has a much better search engine. I’m very particular and know what I want, I wish it were easier to find on thredUP.",3
333,"Ok, could do better: I have been using thredUP for almost a year now. I agree with some other reviewers that the bags I sent in in the beginning sold for double or more the amount that the ones I send in now get. The quality of my items hasn’t decreased, just the payout. 

That being said, shopping with ThredUP has been pretty ok, with some exceptions. Firstly, I see items marked as plus when they are clearly not. I have been fooled once or twice and ordered straight sized items from the plus section marked as plus. Secondly, occasionally something will be incorrectly marked as a certain brand or style. For instance, I bought a trench coat. Turns out, the coat was actually a lightweight shirt dress that appeared to be a trench but was not. 

I can say that with all of these issues, I am still using thredUP because sometimes the deals are truly phenomenal. I am just a lot more careful and I take advantage of their free returns whenever something arrives that’s not as described.",3
334,"I love ThreadUp!: I discovered ThreadUp a few years ago buying a few things for my then high school aged daughter. I was always very disappointed in their plus size selection. The clothes seemed low quality and the photographs were very poor. 

Back in late August, I was playing around on my phone and went to the site on a whim. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The pictures have definitely improved and the selection is now so so much better.

I love being exposed to brands I really like but could never afford. I also like discovering new brands that may not sell where I live. By most accounts, items sell at least 50% off standard retail, some more or less. There is so much to choose from; work or play clothes, all season’s clothing and party dresses too!

The photographer should be commended for the styling of the clothing, for it gives you a idea of how they would look on you. This along with the measurements helps me decide if the item is for me.

I have made several purchases and have an arm’s length list of items I want to buy. Returns are very easy and customer service is great!

I will from now on, shop here before other thrift stores or ( gasp ) the mall stores!

Consider me a loyal customer!

335,"Recommend Thrifting In-Person: So I’m keeping this at three stars because I think some of my opinion is just that- an opinion. But I’ve found that I simply cannot thrift online because I can’t try on the clothes, and Thred Ups return policy is garbage.

They list the sizes of course, but with women’s sizes things are so up-in-the-air, I ordered two things in a size I know usually fits me, and they ended up being too small. This isn’t Thred Ups fault, but the issue is that it was going to cost me more money in fees to return the items than it did to buy them.

I understand that Thred Up is a thrift store, and most thrift stores don’t accept returns. But I feel that when you’re shopping online and can’t try things on, there has to be an option to send something back that you can’t use. And while they do have that, it’s roughly a $5 fee per item, plus the cost of shipping. It was going to cost me $20 to return a $17 order, unless i got store credit.

I’m sure that this store works out wonderfully for some people, but it really isn’t for me, and I want to make others like me aware of the issues I ran into. Don’t expect to reasonably be able to return anything. If you’re fine with accepting what you get, then have fun! If you want to know for sure that what you’re ordering will fit you, then this store isn’t for you.",3
336,"One more chance: I’ve been a customer with thredup for years. On my last order, only one out of my four items were shipped. And it shipped from a completely different warehouse which I thought was weird, because I know I didn’t select that shipping option and the items didn’t ship from my home warehouse. I waited a week to see if my other items would arrive. They didn’t. So I contacted customer service via chat, was told they had no answer and they would have to discuss this with their team. I waited several more days for a response, and somehow, miraculously, after asking for my money back via email, did my items somehow suddenly ship. I was not thrilled with this experience, and I was tempted to delete my account and information and delete the app entirely. Giving y’all one more chance. Not thrilled either that prices have skyrocketed on USED clothing either. $50 for a pair of jeans. I can buy NEW jeans for that much. Do better.",2
337,"App cost me $75 on return-screwed up application of a reward: I applied the use of my reward for “No restocking fees” on a return order. I intentionally used this reward for this return order because I returned multiple items. When I received the receipt for the amount refunded, it was nearly $75 less than it should have been. I did the math and all restocking fees were deducted from the return amount. Yet AGAIN, the app did not apply the reward I definitely chose to apply. 
You cant even use the “Chat” with customer service feature on the app OR website during the posted business hours AND there is NO phone number posted anywhere- i.e., no way to contact customer service except via email, & it takes about a week to receive a reply. 
I am an avid ThredUp user, but between the shipping & restocking fees, continued screwing up of rewards applications, & poor customer service, I am seriously considering no longer using or recommending using ThredUp.",2
338,"Hooray for affordability 😭: I love thred up, theres so many brands on here even brands you might not think would be on here like dollskill or current mood! It’s so worth it to look through the items here and if you’re a thrifting vet theres way more than just designer items here theres items for coveted brands that sell for insane prices on depop and instagram that I have found here. My favorite part about thred up so far though, I have always wanted a piece from the brand Céline but its so incredibly expensive I never believed I would be able to buy something from them until now. I have found a few pieces I am able to save up for with my current job, and I am looking forward to getting one of them soon! Thank you thred up for making a childhood hope come true!",5
339,"I love this app but....: After having 3 kids I am no longer as small as I once was. This isn’t the fault of thred up, although what woman doesn’t wish she could blame her weight gain on someone or something outside herself, aging, or having kids. Anyways! I love LOVE the finds here! My only issue is the sizing. Ahh, yes I have to look in the xl sizes, and as I ooh and ahh over dresses and pants and tops, I’ve come to learn (the hard way) that a LOT of the clothing listed as XL ends up being much smaller. Like multiple of sizes smaller. Which bums me out! I’m already insecure enough being bigger than I’ve ever been, but finding an outfit I can’t wait to wear, only to find out after ordering it, and waiting for it to arrive, that it doesn’t fit?!?! And then I have to mail it back! Which takes time, and I’m already juggling three kids. Sigh. 

I’m just saying. Can y’all get a little more accurate with your sizing? I don’t know a single woman that is an XL that can fit a 28” top. Ok? Thanks!",3
340,"Game changer for my wardrobe: I’m obsessed with ThredUP. The app is really easy to navigate, use and browse. The selection of clothes is amazing and it makes so much sense to purchase these fabulous brands at significantly reduced prices. I wear some of my clothes only a handful of times which makes me wonder why I’d spend so much money on these brands. I send in my clothes and I get to switch out with someone else’s hardly worn beautiful clothes. Most of the clothes feel and look like brand new and not something you’re buying at a thrift store. I’ve had so many compliments on the clothing I’ve purchased and nobody would ever know they’re second hand. 
The quality is high, the return policies excellent. Only minus is I’m just waiting for them to allow me to send my clothes to do my clean out.",5
341,"Like a very cool online consignment shop!: Love the site overall, some things end up way overpriced but sometimes items end up being underpriced as well, check back frequently to find the best deals. I set up alerts for brands I like but if you have FOMO like I do (esp when it comes to shopping) you might want to avoid this because the pressure to buy before someone else does has caused me to spend more than I would by browsing normally. Set alerts at your own risk! App has great user interface, really easy to sort and filter by size or brand. Wish the item descriptions were a little more detailed or measurements were provided but I can usually do a little online detective work and find out that info on my own. All in all, a little addictive for us constant shoppers, but really fun and easy to use!",5
342,Needs major improvement: I recently found out about the Thred up app through social media and thought that the idea was quite stellar. After downloading the app however I found that I actually am leaning towards deleting it. The feature that I think needs the most improvement is the fact that people can have items  in their cart for up to 24 hours. This has annoyed me for the past two days as I have been watching two items that I really want go back and forth between peoples carts (I somehow keep missing the notification that it has become available) and since none one has bought the items they are just sitting in people’s carts. If thredUP  didn’t have this option of “holiding” the item I would have bought the two items already. I think to accommodate younger people as well the app needs to focus on having a better percentage of money they give to their sellers- you can’t have the app without them so why should they not be paid a fair amount.,2
343,"S L O W. and not altogether fair: So- I thought hey- I’ll do this. I can’t really physically haul all this to my regular consignment and this looks easy. And it was. 

Problem is- a brand new $300 pair of boots fetches $20? And a $150 blouse fetches $4? I mean who makes this crap up? At least be reasonable. And why oh why must I wait a flipping month for my funds to be available to cash out? 

Pluses:
Easy
Brings “found” money

Negatives:
The amounts given to consignor are low. Like sad low. 
Slow. I mean count the birthdays and pack a lunch- this is not a quick turnaround to get your money. 
Takes forever for them to process your bag. 
Takes 2 weeks to ship a new bag to you-so order a few at a time. 
Don’t call them—- good luck getting anyone to actually call if you have an issue. And the customer service agents get a little snide or are just obtuse when it comes to listening to the issues. I’ve waited 4 months for a funds that got “lost” in an electronic transfer. When they finally understood after 4 calls, it took over a month for the funds to be sent. HEADSMACK

GET IT TOGETHER THREDUP, you’ve got something good here but altogether frustrating and insulting to sellers. 

As a buyer- super cool. Somethings take awhile to ship—- like weeks. But the prices are cool and some of the finds are amazing.",5
344,"Love thredUp!!: Love this app and getting quality items for less! I have been slowly adding nicer name brand items to my closet monthly and love that I can do that affordably with thredup! I love that you can hold things in your cart for 24 hrs before it expires and is then up for grabs again. Also, it’s fun to have the option of possibility snagging something in someone else’s cart as well when the time is up. I’m also encouraged to shop when they offer coupons through the app and free shipping as a VIP member. 

I’ve done the closet clean out kit which is nice if you want to just get rid of items you don’t wear anymore in your closet, but don’t expect to make money off of them as the payout isn’t much. 

Overall a great experience and love the fun mail I receive whenever I get a polka dotted package!",5
345,Rate of processing delivering: I’m used to the longer waits on both new items and return items and it’s very worth the waits! I’ve restocked my wardrobe thru thredUP. Lost 40 pounds plus I live in the far away reaches of consignment stores which I have used for decades. I end up returning very few but when I do I do it for store credit free return shipping and ALWAYS find something else. I do wonder how a 26-32 bust ever makes it in to Large and extra large and just don’t order because there is so much to choose from over a little time. I see they have switched to just stating if it’s large extra large or medium etc and according to the size charts there would never be such bust sizes so I’m hoping they are conforming to the size charts with this change. We all know tags for size are soooo variable! That’s the main hassle .....sizing.,5
346,"Terrible communication methods: This is a great app/site. However, I’ve been sleuthing and I’m pretty technologically advanced and still cannot find a way to communicate with thredup.  There is no message center where you can email them and they email you back through your account.  All i wanted to do was adjust the price of an item that they accepted and I emailed them through my personal email and never got a response.  Then i recd a notification that my item sold about 10–14 days later.  Too late to adjust the price.  I opened the app and a popup said i had messages but then went to find the message and there is literally no place to retrieve them!  They need to fix this!!!!! Ridiculous that I had no control over my item once i sent it to them and now it’s gone.  Additionally, i can’t figure out how to get paid for my item. They want me to use the credit to buy more stuff but I don’t want to do that.  Until they fix this problem and make it far more intuitive, I don’t trust them.",2
347,"Serious Privacy Concern: I have been a loyal shopper (VIT status) and seller on this platform for over three years. My account was banned without warning or notification. After enquiring, I was informed that, because the address I live at/ship things to (which is a university, identifiable by a simple Google search) is utilized by other users aka fellow students, my account was banned as they have a one account per household policy. I sincerely doubt a human employee is responsible, as the first line of the address is the school name. Do humans still work here? 
I was then offered the option to “merge” accounts and given a list of all the other emails that belong to these fellow students. This is insane. If I said I wanted to merge accounts, would I have access to other people’s payment information? In addition to, perhaps, their home address? I certainly have my permanent addresses saved. This is an incredible breach of privacy and once I am able to cash out my earnings, I will be using Depop, Vinted, and Vestaire Collection.",1
348,I used to love thred up but not so much anymore: I’ve been using thredUP for a few years now and loved them until recently. Over the past several months they have made changes to their policies that are not favorable to their customers. They’ve practically gutted their rewards program with the biggest change being that you only get reward points for the very first clean out bag you send in for sale. I used to send in at least two bags a year for resale. Next they drastically reduced the clothing brands they will allow for resale with reimbursement to the seller. And just last week they increased their shipping costs. And don’t let them fool you- once your time is up and your clothing is supposedly taken off of their site to be “donated” it is still out there for sale for several months so they are still getting money out of it when it sells. You’re just not getting your percentage. It’s a nice concept but has run its course.,2
349,"Poor policies, and prices, look for other sites!: I used to really enjoy thred up. They have changed their policy on selling so now you have roughly 2 months to have your item sold and only receive payouts 15 days after an item is sold, if it is not returned by the buyer. They essentially have shifted the selling to your responsibility rather than them. Sites like Poshmark would be a better place to sell if it is “your job” to manage listings. Payouts are irregularly and are unbelievably low. Prices for buying clothing is the same as if you were to buy at a store, and a majority of the time do not reflect consignment pricing. I sent in a coach purse that was in excellent shape that they did not list because it had a small stain on an inside pocket. Customer service is poor, like many of the other reviews suggest. I hate writing bad reviews but I genuinely wish someone would have told me about how this company has changed and how their quality has greatly diminished. I would think twice before using them for buying or selling. I will not be using again.",1
350,"Good product, decent app but still some features missing: For a company that I would guess is majority app based there are still some key features missing from the app that you can only get on the desktop version.  Customer support is not great but returns and shopping are easy.  Selling is not great and they payout is sub optimal.  I would only sell on thredUP if you don’t really care how much you get for an item and your main goal is just to get it out of your house.  Always get return assurance if you think you may want more $$ or are on the fence!!!

Warehouse workers are undoubtedly metric’d on speed not accuracy so inaccurate or incomplete listings are not uncommon.  I would be very cautious when buying anything listed as ‘final sale’.  

That said I made a resolution in 2019 to convert to 100% used clothing (excepting thing like undergarments) and thredUP has been a big win for me in meeting my goals.",4
351,"Not a great experience: I bought 3 times from Thred up and had a good experience. Then I ordered a goody box. I had questions about it, and attempted to contact customer service via the app. A week later I received a response that did not answer my question fully. I tried to contact them again, this time it was even longer before I received a reply, and once again my original issue was not addressed. The goody box I received contained many wrong sizes and damaged items. One dress was clearly ripped and 1 pair of earrings were completely bent. I know what they sell is used, but Thred up makes a big deal about how they are supposedly “picky” about what they accept to sell. I don’t think I will buy from them again. At least a week to hear back from customer service is unacceptable to me, and I can buy damaged merchandise from my local thrift store for much less if that is what I want. I bought from Thred up because they claim to only accept high quality items in good to perfect shape.",2
352,"Opinion: Thread up is a great platform for secondary clothing sales. And much more convenient then doing the physical digging in person. However, in my opinion you shouldn’t have stipulations about your rewards program. If your customers earned the points by shopping with you then let us use them how we want. They shouldn’t expire and there shouldn’t be minimums and sale or no sale. More then likely your gonna get more spending if the discount is substantial. I noticed the re rack pricing has gone up….so like give us a break in the other departments. Secondary gripe, the 2 measurements you provide is not enough. It would be really helpful to know if a brand runs small or large. And lastly maybe it’s time to think about using a reusable bag for the clothing inside. Last drop off the box and partial clothing was soaked, really glad the wasn’t and clothing bleed out, cause that could be disastrous. Anyways overall pretty happy, but y’all could do better.",2
353,"Great for buying, have not had luck selling: I love that thredUP is helping to disrupt the environmental destruction that the fashion industry can bring. From a shopping standpoint, the online retailer carries a wonderful selection of (straight) sizes for those looking to reduce their carbon footprint when it comes to clothing. The buyers side is a wonderful place where I’ve gotten some staples of my wardrobe. The goody boxes are curated expertly and the clothing is of good quality. 

Selling has been a slightly different story for me. I’ve sold a number of items with thredUP and have encountered more than once that something I sent in to sell has been listed on the site despite the team “rejecting” it, meaning I would get no percentage of a sale. I sent an email identifying the pieces and asking what was happening but never received a response from the team. Thus, I would rate the otherwise exceptional app/site 4 stars.",4
354,"Saving my clothes budget: It’s tough to keep your kids closets full when you’re on a budget! My oldest jumped 2 sizes right before school started. She needed a new wardrobe. Thanks to ThredUp, I can get my kiddos clothes with the money I earn from selling on ThredUp…it’s the circle of life for clothes! I always look forward to their AMAZING sales. And the outlet area is great too! I’ve also been known to dip into my sizes…way more than I’d like to admit. But since I can order a sell bag and fill it up, it makes cleaning out our closets way easier, and filling them up way less guilty. I’m also a big fan of the fact that they donate whatever doesn’t get sold. It would kill me to throw away perfectly good clothes and have them end up in a landfill. Overall, I’m a huge fan. Totally recommend.",5
355,"Search function changed and is useless now: I have been shopping on Thredup and using the app since 2016. I have bought tons of items and thoroughly enjoyed searching for bargains. Recently, though, the search function has been useless. I have saved searches for brands like “Commando” and they worked great. Now the search for Commando shows camo print clothing. I have a search set up for “Irregular Choice” shoes, as well, and it is showing a variety of brands of shoes, none of which are Irregular Choice. This has been frustrating to say the least. I also do not sell to them anymore because the amount of money you get is practically zero. I’d rather donate to a nonprofit. I would like to keep shopping with Thredup because I have found lots of gems. But if the search function and save search function are not fixed, I won’t be able to find any gems to buy.",3
356,"Used to Love but not so much any longer: When I first starting using ThredUP I absolutely loved getting clothes from them.  Over all I haven’t had a bad experience receiving clothes although I did receive a wrong item once and have had to send other items back that were way too small and didn’t seem to be correctly sized.  
I have also sent clothes to be sold.  My first bag that I sent was almost all put on site to be sold.  The last 2 bags have barely had items put on the site.  They do not give an option to have the clothes that they did not put on the site sent back to you.  I have nice things that I would like to have the option for them to be sent back to me.  I will no longer be sending clothes to be sold to ThredUP as they don’t send what they don’t want back or even give that option.  Also, it takes months to process the bag.",3
357,"Lying, grifting,and greenwashing.: You can make all the excuses you want about how “iT’s A CuRAteD sTOre” when trying to justify charging in store prices for second hand clothes, but at the end of the day, you’re taking advantage of people who can’t afford good clothes. You’re not using the money to pay your workers OR your sellers well either, you’re just lining the pockets of big wigs. 

Then there’s the green washing. The storage facilities and the delivery are NOT actually helping the environment as much as you say it will. The shipping still creates an obnoxious amount of greenhouse gasses anyway, so it’s better to just go to your local thrift store. 

Lastly, I’ve recently found out they’ve been lying to people about certain clothing brands’ brands. I used to have an old navy dress that I recently gave to a friend (that I purchased at local thrift store 3 YEARS ago for 3 dollars) that was old navy. I saw that same dress in a different size on thredup that was labeled as torrid (which it was most definitely NOT) and they were charging over 30 DOLLARS for a dress that was manufactured 3 YEARS ago AND isn’t even the brand they say it is! While thankfully I personally haven’t gotten a different brand than what it said it was selling me, I can’t imagine the disappointment when someone buys their overpriced second hand clothes only to realize they were lied to and ripped off. 

Overall, you’re better buying on eBay and Poshmark (or your local thrift store)",1
358,"Buy don’t donate: I’ve been shopping ThredUP for a while.  Personally I think it’s especially helpful during Covid.  
But we already have local thrift stores where one can buy any item for 50% of its Cost on thredUP (or even less).  I’m concerned to primarily support those brick and mortar thrift stores—and use ThredUp as a backup for especially bad Covid months.
I would also advise to never send in good designer clothing to this company.  I did the bag clean out, and sent in a bunch of designer clothes worth good money.  Whoever was on the receiving end of that was either high, or corrupt.  For instance, I was awarded like $15 for a business suit that cost me like $400.  You’d do better donating high end clothes to a local thrift store near you, where underprivileged people could actually benefit from the gift.",5
359,"Good deals found here: I have purchased several articles of clothing. I like Thredup where they provide measurements  of the article so you know if it will fit or not. Never had a problem if I needed to return an item and it’s easy to print out their postage paid label and send back the item, to get either store credit or refunded on your credit card. I also sent in clothing that I had that I didn’t love anymore and got one of their cleanout kits. It’s fun to ship off 14 pounds of unwanted clothing , have someone else process it, photographed and sell it for you. the pay out is lower than some places but it is worth it if you don’t have the time to do this on your own. The clothing that they don’t accept is responsibly donated and recycled  to other places- win win keeping stuff out of our landfill waste stream.",5
360,"The best way to shop.: I started using ThredUp last year when I started a new job that required me to wear business formal every day. Coming from a completely wfh environment in which meetings were confined to two days per week, I was overwhelmed with the upfront cost of work-appropriate pants, tops, dresses, and shoes. On a whim, I looked for a pair of pants I had tried on at Loft on ThredUp and was shocked by how many options there were for exactly what I wanted. AND I didn’t have to spend full price for any of it - even items that still had tags.

Now ThredUp is my go-to shopping platform. I also send all of my closet clean-out to them and in a few months I have credit to spend on a refresh. It’s a great, and sustainable way, of keeping my closet interesting and tailored to what I need.",5
361,"Addicted: I do love thredUP. There are some great deals when you take the time to look.
The item descriptions are often wrong; they’ll say inseam 29” and it’s actually 34”. Or like new but it actually has holes or pills.
I wish the descriptions were a little more inclusive, like maybe say it’s a stretchy knit or velvet, instead of just listing the fabric content. I know the warehouse is a busy place, but I feel they should check for holes and snags etc. and list them.
But returns are simple if you live in the lower 48. (I’d just rather not fly all those packages around the country.) I live in Alaska so the return options are not available, other than pay your own shipping, which is expensive, so a more complete listing would help. 
But I’ve built myself a beautiful wardrobe the past few years, and somehow I just want to keep shopping.",4
362,"Lately: I have always been a big fan of Thred Up and have shopped there almost exclusively. I am starting to see some negative changes: decrease in quality and carelessness in screening items that are sent in to sell. My last 2 bags took more than 5 months to process. 1 bag had only 1 item posted for sale and I dont think it was even mine ( I did address this with customer service with ZERO explanation) and the 2 nd bag they took NOTHING. In the many bags that I have submitted over the past few years they have taken 80% of my items for resale and commented that this was above average. I have not sent any junk, yet they posted 0% of my items- when I asked about this- they were unable to provide any explanation and the only response I got was “ you should have asked for your items back”. This was not the point- I KNOW that I sent quality items but NONE were usable?? In 2 different VERY full bags?? Sadly, This damages my trust and makes me less enthusiastic about dealing with this company",1
363,"Gone downhill: It was always my go to, for years and years. But the last year almost, the description and measurements have been so inaccurate, I’ve had to send back at least one thing every order. I know the restocking fee is waived, but you can only get the refund as thred up dollars and the inconvenience to go and print the label and everything would be avoided if the descriptions and measurements were just .. somewhat accurate?! Also, many times the item on the mannequin is a completely different fit than in person (ie fitted due to pinning on mannequin but is actually a baggy item in person). 

I’m also pretty disappointed on pricing lately - Forever 21 items around $20 .. there’s hardly anything in that store brand new for $20 lol. Just one example. 

This never used to happen. I unfortunately may be throwing in the towel on thred up after ~4-5 years with y’all.",3
364,"Getting worse and worse: Like many thrifting sites (eBay, ETSY), ThredUp started out as a complete treasure trove: an exciting, even fun way to find unique items on the cheap. But, as the company has become greedier and greedier, the buyers and sellers have come to feel  more and more exploited. The thrill is gone, and so is the fun. Many items are up near retail price. ThredUp keeps 90 percent of the sale price on most items. You have to pay $2/item for returns. Shipping costs keep rising. And some customers’ carts are deleted after four hours, while other customers, for some mysterious reason, can keep their carts for triple-to-quadruple that time. It’s now more lucrative to sell on Kidizen and cheaper to shop on Poshmark, ironically, where sellers set all of their own prices. ThredUp is on the path to Tradesy irrelevance. Time to move to a new upstart.",5
365,"Disappointed: I love thrifting for clothes! You can find some amazing items for awesome prices! But please be aware this sites descriptions are misleading and should be more honest about condition. When an item description is listed as “excellent condition, you might mistake it as brand new” and then comes with a bright pink stain on a light grey top I was so disappointed! Another listed in the same condition was a sweater that has a huge snag on the arm. It’s very noticeable in person but wasn’t shown in pictures or listed in the description. If I saw in a thrift store I would have put it back on the rack. The site is very misleading and over values it’s items because you can’t see flaws in the listings pictures. Lastly they advertise free returns but charge a restocking fee of $1.99 per item and they won’t return money only offer store credit. You may have better luck but I was very disappointed and I will not make the mistake of buying from here again.",2
366,"Worthless - DO NOT USE!: I have been using ThredUP for about a year and have placed over 20 orders. I have sent in multiple clean out kits of items to sell. I put up with the low payouts because it’s just so easy- no listing anything, no pictures to take, etc.

I sent in my most recent clean out kit in May and it’s yet to be processed despite multiple inquiries. I have been more than understanding about delays- it’s 2020 after all, but it’s been over 4 months, this is ridiculous! I sent in summer items which will of course fail to sell since they’re so far out of season. Customer service has been no help- no proactive communication about how long it’s taking/why, no offer of store credit or a plan to send backlogged items to another warehouse for processing. At this point I just want my items back so I can donate them. 

DO NOT USE THREDUP! I can’t wait to get my items back/sold so I can delete this app once and for all. I used to tell all my friends to use it, and now I tell everyone to avoid it.",1
367,Slow start but now a frequent user: It took me awhile to understand how to best use ThredUP but now that I’ve started to figure out best ways to find desirable items I really love it. It’s so helpful to use the filters and the most recent update has been great! Shipping takes awhile but overall shopping through ThredUP is my new favorite way to shop. It’s is socially responsible and I’ve found some awesome deals on designer items that I would not typically purchase for full price. I even purchased a brand new pair of FRYE leather boots normally $300 for $80! Loving this shopping experience after several months of use I now am addicted. I recently sent items of my own to sell and am looking forward to seeing how that process goes.  Thank you ThredUP! Can’t wait to see what other improvements you are able to make!,5
368,"Huge Fan of Buying on Thred Up - Not So Much on the Selling Side: I’m a huge fan of buying on Thred Up - Not so much on the selling side though.  I’ve had great luck in finding some brand new pieces (with the tags) at very reasonable prices.  I’ve had to return one or two things, and everything went very smoothly.  On the selling side, I have been extremely disappointed though.  I’ve sent in 3 boxes of clothes to sell through Thred Up and quite a few items they claim we’re not in sellable condition, when in fact they were some that even had the tags still on them.  When I questioned Customer Service, they claimed they were stained, etc and I have photos (taken the morning I send the boxes) showing that the items were in perfect condition.  By the time I questioned them and they responded, I couldn’t even get my items back, I found this all very disappointing.",4
369,"It’s like a sale 24/7!!: I absolutely love Thred-Up! I’m a plus sized woman and it’s crazy how expensive clothes have become. I don’t know about anyone else in smaller sizes but I’d imagine it’s the same for us all. I’ve just recently sent in another thread up bag and I know I’ll have some money to spend. I’m very particular about my clothes.  I rarely put my clothes in the dryer and most of my clothes last a very long time because I’m not beating them up in the dryer.  I also love cotton and I find a lot of my sizes that would fit but because it’s been in the dryer,they shrink up. Remember ladies, if something is too big for you the only thing that the dryer will do is shrink it up!!! It never shrinks it sideways…. Never! Looking forward to seeing some new items and happy thrifting!",5
370,"Isn’t what it used to be.: I used to like selling with ThredUp, but in the last several months, they’ve started to charge for processing clean out kits, they leave a very large return window so it takes a while to either get paid out on something or have the item relisted (I say this as one of my items sold almost a month ago and it still says sold, but I’m told the customer requested to return the item and as of today, ThredUp has still not received it.) I got a notification that all my items were listed and live, but I had to contact support three times before that was accurate, which actually took about two weeks. From these reviews, it appears buyers have another set of challenges they’ve faced with ThredUp. It takes 4-6 months for some of the clean out kits to be processed so this also seems to delay things. This is a bummer, because I used to really like selling on ThredUp. After my last bag is sold, I’m deleting the app and won’t be using ThredUp anymore.",1
371,"It was okay/ stop the WRINKLES 😭: It was okay I guess for a teen. I look through it and I kept thinking why are the clothes to wrinkly? Like I feel like if your gonna model clothes for people to wear to iron it, or try to make it look less wrinkly. Like it’s not a one time thing like almost all the cloths are wrinkly. 😭and it’s looks like it’s more for old people. I only found like 5 things I actually like. I might buy them but hint it sure. And I feel like it would be better to see the cloths modeled on people so I can see what it looks like on a person to see if it might fit my figure but with our that I might buy something and it would look good on my figure. So better to see it on a person before I buy. The prices are good it’s just the quality and the showing of the clothes needs to be better. I’m just so confused that like almost all the clothes have WRINKLES on them 😭😭😭😭",3
372,"Items I’ve bought have been in better shape then described: I love the great finds on here! It’s the first place I go to shop. I do feel it’s a bit deceiving when it comes to selling your items. For example it’s says there is no payouts on”bargaining brands” like old navy, Maurice’s and Target brands. I took this to mean they accept the items and do not sell them just donate them. This is not the case. They do sell them they just don’t give the person whose  items they are any payout when the items sell. I think this is a little shady as it’s pure profit for Threadup. If you’re going to sell an item the person who donated it should get some portion of the sale like the items deemed not “ bargain brands”. That being said the items I’ve bought have been in better shape then the listing described.  I’d recommend them to anyone.",4
373,"Cashmere and wool sweaters: I love shopping on ThredUP.  I’m a clothes horse and it’s just plain fun to browse and buy!  Most of my purchases have been as described.  I have purchased many cashmere and wool sweaters over the past 2 years.  I always select like new and new with tags as my option under condition.  Several times I have received sweaters with moth holes, which should not be under like new and new with tags.  It’s a disappointment, but I repair them instead of returning them. When your team is inspecting wool garments please have them take more time, to insure they are free from moth damage.  I enjoy the app, it’s wonderful using all the filters and that saves me time.  Your variety of brands is fantastic!  Keep up the good work.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review.",5
374,"How to Save the Planet: There’s so much waste in the world of clothing—especially women’s clothing—and we spend way too much trying to “look good.” ThredUP is the way to address both of those problems. I’m better dressed, richer, and having more fun with my clothes since I found ThredUP. I don’t shop anywhere else, as a matter of fact (except, you know, for underwear and socks). Family members beg me to buy them gifts from “That place” because they know I can get 10x the value there than anyplace else. Personally, I think there’s a learning curve—figuring out what filters you need in order to get the best options to consider. Save up a lot of “Favorites” before you actually shop, review thoughtfully, fill your cart...then wait 12 hours to make sure no impulse buys are happening, and you’ll be a very happy camper indeed.",5
375,"favorite secondhand app: I’m a big thrifter and love using Thredup! I primarily shop secondhand and this has been a huge way to build my wardrobe and tailor it to what I need. I mostly use it to buy items from my favorite brands that aren’t nearby at cheaper prices. I always enjoy shopping on Thredup and have never received a poor quality item. Love being able to sort items my size, color, brand, etc. The prices are sometimes pricey(more than goodwill) but usually fair, especially when there is a sale. Love the ability to bundle my items and “save” them in my cart for a bit. I like the points but wish it didn’t deduct so much if I return an item. The bingo sales were kind of fun but wish there were smaller prizes too and we could see if anyone actually won anything. A close up shot of the material or detailing would be helpful for many items.",4
376,"Love it! But could be a little better: I have loved thred up so far since my favorite YouTuber Rachel Maksy introduces it to me but there are things I would improve on 
Like the measurements on skirts they only give you the length measurement not the waist but on pants and jeans and such they give waist and length as well. It makes skirt shopping a hit or miss most of the time and a little disappointing when you find something so cute but end up having to return because it doesn’t fit. I also wish the tops category had a option for more details sleeve searches, as in not just have long or 3/4 sleeve etc searches but having the style of sleeve as well like bishop, puffed and lantern, etc. It would make finding what you need/want a lot faster but I know that’s a tedious detail to add so I understand why it’s not in. Other than these small inconveniences I love thred up overall

377,"Super Sweet Threads: I have been blown away by the quality and condition of the clothes I have bought on OfferUp. I am a thrift store nerd and never by brand new clothes—luckily, OfferUp takes second-hand clothes shopping to a whole new level with the quality and plethora of designer digs. It is so fun to shop on! I love that I can favorite items and get notified when the price drops on stuff I’m considering. Sometimes I impulse buy at thrift stores, knowing that if I like it and don’t buy it then it will likely sell or never be found again. On OfferUp I can save something and come back to it without feeling a need to purchase right away. I often shop and wait for sales and buy items I have already saved. This is a great concept and a really well designed app.",5
378,"Pay Attention, Thred Up!: I sent these guys some nice dress shoes to sell on my behalf. They posted the wrong photo with the description of my shoes (the photo was of some canvas tennis shoes). I tried to contact them on three different occasions and the only response I got was the auto-reply that they had gotten my communication and would get back to me. That never happened. In the meantime, my shoes weren’t selling because the photo didn’t match the description. Finally, a week before the listing expired, they put the correct photo with it. I’m really irritated because I’m sure they would have sold were it not for their mistake. Now, the listing has expired and I have two options: pay $6 to get my shoes back or donate them to Thred Up. They should send them back for free since they messed up the listing or relist them. I will NEVER send anything to these guys again. They have unresponsive customer service and they’re not paying attention to make sure their listings are correct which causes items not to sell...and the customer gets hosed.",1
379,"Honestly I’d give 2.5 stars: I love this idea in concept. Especially for jeans, t shirts, etc. But I don’t understand why you think that someone in their right mind would pay more than $40 for something that there is only two photos of, taken from a distance. If there is minor wear on a designer handbag that you have marked at $200, I’d like to see what you think “minor wear” looks like to make sure we are on the same page. If you can’t show photos of the wear/damage then stick to low end stuff. It feels like this is a bit of a garage sale tumble but they also list high end products and expect you to buy them blind. The prices on the designer stuff isn’t any better than Poshmark and they show close ups in that site. My review is this is great for cheap stuff if you don’t mind gambling on an $8 t-shirt but go to Poshmark if you’re spending more than $40 on an item.",3
380,"Favorite online secondhand shop!!!: It can be so difficult to buy anything secondhand online and trust what you’re getting is what was described. ThredUP makes it clear if the product has any flaws and what the flaw is. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because 1. It would be great if there was a closeup photo of the flaw, 2. Prices of items are often reasonable but sometimes way off for a secondhand item, 3. There is now a restocking fee when for about 4 years there wasn’t which can really add up at $1.99 per item, and 4. (Specifically about the app) It is easier to search for something very specific on ThredUP’s website compared to the app such as “boots” with a “slouch” or “lace up” style. These four are really my only complains. Everything else about this app and ThredUP itself I love and recommend!",5
381,"Love this app: I've sold a lot of items on Thred Up, and bought a lot of great items as well. Great app; overall I'm a fan. I definitely think this is a fun and convenient app for thrifting. I really appreciate the new filters that Thred Up has added to make navigating the many items easier. The petites filter they added is *everything.* I am leaving one star off because the filtering options do still need some love, though. I would like to be able to filter by ""short"" length at some point. And the search bar is mostly to search for a specific brand. It would be helpful if at some point, Thred Up could use more keywords (i.e. you could search for ""black turtleneck"" and get a bunch of results). Also, I've noticed you can't filter by type of shoe. Like, you can't filter just for ""sneakers."" I hope to see the filtering options get better with time.",4
382,"My new obsession: I love this app. It scratches the “mindless scroll” itch, but also facilitates low-pressure shopping; shopping in stores is overwhelming for me! I would like to suggest an update though:

I’m not naturally a big shopper. I really wish ThredUp allowed shopping by occasion (work/party/formal/casual). It can be hard to just window shop the endless selection, when I KNOW I only need to find clothes for the office or for a single event. I get halfway there by narrowing in on a few brands, but I know I’m missing out on the brands I don’t know yet!

I would also eventually love to see the option of “personal preferences” on individual accounts. If I could just say “I hate peplums/A-lines/plaid, never show them”, it would really speed up my buying process (and therefore frequency).",5
383,"What she said CHAMPAGNE TAST but BEER BUDGET!: This is an overwhelming and addicting shop! OMG I’m still in the beginning stage ya know when your jaw drops and whoa! Comes out of your mouth! I seriously want everything I see which is why I’m completely overwhelmed! Great brands that I could never afford elsewhere for sure! What a relief you are. My only concern is that I’m afraid since each brand fits differently that I’m afraid I’ll get them and they’ll be too tight. A lot of high end designer brands are smaller than others. But I just have to take the plunge and have some fun because the prices are outstanding and it’s super fun to shop and see what just came in next. Great concept though! Keep it up and try to solicit more handbags, totes, shoulder bags and satchels etc...I’m a bag freak!! Love what you’re doing!! Keep it up and ty for the bargain prices!! Erin 💕",5
384,"Could benefit from a couple improvements: I love the idea and how many ways you can filter and search for what you are looking for. One complaint I have is the vague description of the kids clothing. On more than one occasion, I have purchased off season items because of a misleading and/or vague description of the item. For example, I ordered jeans for my toddler for the Spring/Summer. When they arrived they had a flannel lining that was not part of the description. The fabric said 100% cotton. Another time, I received “skinny” jeans. The description said straight leg/cut and of course they did not fit. I would have never ordered otherwise. This is HIGHLY frustrating. Returns are a hassle, costly, and include restocking fees so I don’t bother and I waste my money also because my kid/s can’t fit the item when the season does come around. This will be a deal breaker if it happens again.",3
385,"The Only Way I’ll Shop: ThredUP has completely transformed my wardrobe. It allows me to purchase high-end designer clothing at a small fraction of the retail price. I receive so many compliments on my clothes and people are always shocked to hear they are used. 
The shopping process is so easy. I love that my options are automatically narrowed down to my sizes not to mention I can continue to filter from there to find what I’m looking for. Nearly everything I’ve purchased has fit perfectly and is exactly as described. When an item hasn’t worked out the return process has been so simple. 
I’ve become an unofficial thredUP spokesperson because I truly believe there isn’t a better way to shop. They have altered the way women can buy and have access to incredible clothing at game-changing prices.",5
386,"Good, not great.: I have a couple complaints about ThredUP. 
1. The shipping time is usually about 2 weeks, rather than the 3-8 days that standard shipping claims. Packages arrive in several installment. This is alright, but it staggers when you’ll receive your order. 
2. Sizing is atrocious on the app. Inconsistent and inaccurate. I will put in a specific waist measurement for pants and browse. Unfortunately, the actual size that’s listed in the description rarely matches what it’s advertised as. Very frustrating to find clothes that fit. 
Otherwise, there are plenty of great things about ThredUP. I enjoy online thrifting because the app makes it easy. The pictures model the clothing well, there are great brands. Prices are reasonable for higher end items and you can often score good quality items for cheap. Thank you ThredUP for the great outfits! -A college student on a budget.",4
387,"Fun shopping experience: Two suggestions for improvement: I wish for is a way to ask a question about items and, even more importantly, people shouldn’t be able to perpetually save items in their carts. You can save your cart for 24 hours - then it expires. But you can immediately put it back in your cart and never actually buy it, which keeps others from buying! Totally unfair. I have been following a 4T dress I want to buy for my daughter for three weeks. Every day after 24 hours and 1 second it is immediately back in someone else’s cart. I have an alert set. At the same time every day it becomes available. Barely a second later, it’s back in the cart. Ugh!!! This is bad for me and bad for ThredUP because they are missing out on an actual paying customer.",5
388,"If you are sending your cloths in to sell...: So i loved this business for buying cloths and they even sent me a bag to send my cloths in. 
So I sent lots of cloths, the entire bag was full with about 5 brand new items all worth over $100. 
I got an email giving me only 12 hrs to respond (forget it if you have any kind of life and can’t respond to emails immediately) to somehow contest the $37 they valued my giant bag of nice stuff. 
THIS IS AN UPDATE TO MY OLD REVIEW: I didn’t understand the selling process initially. You ARE able to get back the items that don’t sell and you do have control over the price. I didn’t see the “selling” tab that held all my items! So yeah.. it is a great app and although my cloths didn’t sell, i can still buy amazing cloths for really cheap. The point/reward system is also fantastic and fun.",5
389,"They definitely have to some issues to fix: I love how great the prices are, and the clothes are in great condition, but some of the estimated retail prices are way too high. I was looking at a forever 21 top and it said the estimated retail price was $18. This seemed incorrect, so I tried to do some digging. The top was brand new and still had the tags on it, so in the picture you could clearly see the price and it was $9.90. I get that some of there estimations are wrong, but this just ridiculous. 
I also dislike how little they give the seller. For example, you could pay $25 for an American eagle top, wear it only a couple of times, and have it be in excellent condition, but only make around 40 CENTS for it. I think it's quite unfair considering they sell the top for at least $10. These are just my opinions and I hope thread up will make some changes to their process.",4
390,"Good Finds. Returns not so much.: Good finds, yes. But you just might spend the same amount to try the clothes on and send them back. 

If you want to return anything, there is a restocking fee for every item and return shipping is deducted from your money back. You can send back every item because they didn’t fit or didn’t match the description, and you can still be out $30. And this adds up the more you use the site.

On top of that, the return shipping is so slow that it will take weeks to get back to the company. Once it’s there, you still won’t see your return processed for several days, and then days more until it hits your bank account. An entire credit card cycle can go by without you seeing your money returned, and what you get back is only partially of the amount you put out just to try on someone else’s clothes.",3
391,"Item disappearance: After sending 2 full clean out kits I noted several items did not get listed. I contacted support with this info: 
Hello, there are several items that did not get listed that I want to inquire about. All are name brand items. 1) shawled fringed belted black and white sweater made in Italy 2) black sweater with distressed holes in it 3) a Joe fresh black dress with white threading going vertically down the dress 4) a white brand new pair of button down cuffed 501’s 4) a white pair of cuffed vanilla star jeans. Wondering where these items are. No reason why these items weren’t listed. All in excellent condition!!!

I was told they weren’t listed as the were duplicates items? Really? I should have read the reviews! One customer even went as far as contacting the Better Business Bureau!! We send items on good faith only to discover our clothing stolen!!! READ REVIEWS! DONNOT SEND THEM YOUR CLOTHING!  Donate to local organizations or sell on poshmark! I will be searching for my missing items!! This company is DISHONEST.",1
392,"ok: it’s just ok compared to other online thrift stores/apps. the problem is that clothes still feel kinda pricey even thought they are below retail so I don’t usually buy things as often as I do other thrift places. also the amount of trendy or item pertain to specific aesthetics is still limited and any actually cute piece gets bought up quickly, only leaving grandma clothes. I appreciate the environmental impact thred up has, but it still holds the main con of thrifting which is finding fashionable clothes sustainable for a suited price. I get the bland, granny clothes have to end up somewhere that’s not the landfill, but I wish more effort was made into upcycling them into something wearable. also the search had to be updated cause certain keys words don’t work and thousands of unrelated items come up making what you’re searching for harder to find.",3
393,"Room for improvement, but a must-have regardless: This app offers a fantastic service with unbeatable prices and selection. The app itself functions as intended 98% of the time, but some minor tweaks would enhance the experience:

1) Customizing sizing according to the type of item would really help in finding items my size. I typically wear a size 4 dress but a size 8 in pants, so I end up with listings for size 4 pants and size 8 dresses that won’t fit. The ability to search under a specific type of clothing (pants only for example) would be helpful as well.

2) When selecting an item, it would be nice if I could click on the brand that made the item and shop other items on ThredUP from that brand. The only way to shop by brand as far as I know is by searching for it.

3) There should be a button that allows you to shop for similar items when you click on a listing. As far as I know, that option is only available when an item is sold out or in someone else’s cart.

I would recommend ThredUP to anyone. Great customer service and the app devs seem willing to keep improving their service. Hopefully they will find an opportunity to make some of these adjustments and make the app even better!",5
394,"No way to reach customer service: Half my order was never sent, and customer service took over two days to respond. Their response was to thank me for my patience, and close the complaint. No refund was issued and no explanation was given. I shopped there for years, but lately every order has an issue. For example: they advertised a child's size small top that ended up being a women's size small instead. There is no way to reach someone by the phone. 
You can get reasonable deals buying, but selling is not a good deal unless you consider it a donation. It used to be worth it for the convenience, but the ineptitude of the customer service borders on fraud in my book. Not worth it anymore!!!
Update: A month later I haven't received my clothes, customer service closed every online conversation without resolving the issue, but I was able to contact my bank and have them open an investigation. I got my money back through the bank's fraud department and am deleting the app. Way too much trouble for used clothes! Sheesh!",1
395,"Very impressed with Buying: Fantastic way to save on new and very gently loved items.  I’ve purchased several pieces and am continually impressed with the condition of both shoes and clothing.  Although it’s slightly pricier than some things I’ve purchased through other apps, I prefer the peace of mind knowing everything was vetted first.  My only suggestion would be to be for potential sellers- be prepared to part ways with an item you assume will have value but doesn’t pass their strict screening.  I sent in a pair of basically new, recently produced lululemon shorts (literally worn once) and they, among some Rag and Bone jeans, and Frye classic flats apparently didn’t make the cut.  Not sure what happened there (still following up), but I will definitely continue to purchase!",5
396,"Poor Quality Control: Once upon a time, I loved ThredUp, however, that is no longer the case. Time after time I have had to return my orders. Which I understand to be frustrating from a business standpoint. However, to make matters worse, they have doubled the restocking fee to $3.99 per item. It is my personal belief that if they upped their quality standards, there would inherently be fewer returns. However, they cannot get measurements correct, they cannot get material wear and tear correct, they cannot get sizing correct i.e. the difference between international, plus nor US standard sizing. I have had a standing credit with this company for some time that I do not feel the need to ever use. I don’t want to take the risk of getting something that is substandard quality only to be charged $4 to return it. This is truly unfortunate. I had come to rely on this company to find unique pieces that are not at my local retailers. I live in small town USA and there’s nothing here. Just sad.",1
397,"Will the real size plz stand up?!: I love the ease of browsing, customizing my searches, and the variety of clothes to choose from INCLUDING luxury brands like Armani, with the price points to match. Not to mention the discounts on top of great prices for selling your own clothes! When I received my first order, I was amazed at the packing detail and quality of care that went into sending my order out.  The ONLY reason I’m giving this 4 out of 5 stars is b/c of discrepancies in sizing. I’ll see a pair of pants listed as XL but the measurements will say 26” waist - clearly either not correct OR not an XL. It’s confusing to understand which sizing information is correct. And since you can’t try it on until you’ve purchased it, it becomes redundant.  I really wish that would be corrected b/c I’ve put back many great items simply because there were conflicting measurements/sizes.",4
398,"Buy but don’t sell: I have several purchases and have been very impressed with what I got. It came wrapped in tissue paper and shipped nicely. The box having polka dots on it is exciting to open. 
I sent a bag stuffed with great items, clothing and shoes. Some of my items were new and in style but were not bought.  I wonder the process in determining what is bought. I sent two pair of never worn Dansko clogs that were not bought. Odd to me. I recently sent another bag with lesser items and am waiting to see the buy. I most likely will go back to donating everything to Wings as they are truly 100 percent non profit. The small amount I get back really does not benefit me. 
So, I say buy but only sell if you can accept the value you have is not what they will have. I understand that items not bought are still gone to good use so there is some satisfaction there.",4
399,"I don’t even know where to start...: I was excited when I first found out about ThredUP. I liked the concept and process of putting your items in the polka dot bag and sending it back;however, it went downhill after that. I knew the consignment payout would be lower than the price ThredUP lists items as, but I did not know the payout would be SIGNIFICANTLY lower. I received an email from ThredUP wanting to hear my feedback and if I had any questions, so I expressed my concern and confusion nicely, and asked my questions only to never hear back from them. Also, recently I noticed that the little amount I had in my payout has disappeared. Only a little bit of my payout remains, and I do not know where it went. I never cashed out or got store credit, so I have no clue what happened. I like the concept of ThredUP, but I feel it’s not reached its full potential and is still in development. My advice to new users is to just be wary of what could potentially happen when participating.",2
400,"I Love ThredUP: I have found some very nice pieces from ThredUP. Anytime I have not liked an item, or if it didn’t fit as expected, they have been great about my returning things without any hassle. I have recommended the app to several of my friends and family members. I could not be happier with my experience with this company. I am committed to creating less waste and recycling and reusing in my life in general and buying clothing secondhand fits into my plan perfectly. I usually donate my unwanted clothes and footwear to local thrift shops but I have sold a few things on ThredUP. You get store credit towards your next purchase. You also earn points towards free shipping, waived restocking fees, percentages off handbags, and $$$ off your next purchase. Great online shop!",5
401,"Poor delivery services: Thread up has a very poor tracking set up. It’s hit and miss and mostly miss. With tracking so commonly used by most delivery services these days there is no excuse for such inefficient tracking especially when it sometimes takes weeks for an order to come it is all the more important for the customer to be able to see where it is. Often I check the tracking link and nothing happens or it says pending or something vague. And when you order something for an event you really need to know if it is coming in time or do I need to go out shopping for something tangible. That’s just one area that is flawed big time with thread up. I can find some good things on thread up but it certainly is hit and miss.
PS be sure and check out how much data they have access to about you. Including your medical and financial credit report and so much more. Basically everything.",2
402,"LOVE ThredUP!: I have sent 8 Clean Out bags to ThredUP and received credit for the majority of the items. I then bought myself clothes, my kiddos school uniform khakis, etc. I always bundle for shipping and get a refund for the $5.99 shipping cost. In a total of 14 orders to date, I have had very minor issues- which were fixed by customer service within 48 hours. I love being able to favorite items and receiving an email when the price drops. Also, I like being able to adjust the price of items I send in. This is a great way to get money for what you don’t wear or what children outgrow- then turn around and up cycle other like new items. I have ordered two Goody Boxes and was pleasantly surprised with items in both, I didn’t keep it all but had free return shipping, so it’s a win/win.",5
403,"So far, so good: I have received about 5 orders from this site/app, and it has completely changed the way I shop. I actually really do enjoy shopping in person and being able to try things on. Sizes aren’t really standardized for women and every body type is different (but that’s a whole rant on it’s own). However, you can directly pop in your measurements and search your size. Although, I am still weary about buying bottoms online. Another thing I look at when I shop in person is the fabric quality, and again, thredUP has a search filter for fabric type. They make it as similar as you can to shopping in real life. I am trying to be more conscious about buying new items or aware of fast fashion, and buying used items seems to get rid of the buyers remorse.",5
404,"Absolutely love it: I first learned about thredup through their partnerships with madewell and gap (send your clothes in for credit at these stores). One day I was looking high and low for a top that was sold out everywhere, and found it there. Since then, I’ve been able to find many gems at great prices. I love browsing and checking what’s new. I’ve purchased many pieces that are still sold by brands at  a fraction of the cost. I’ve never had any issues with clothes being in a bad shape, just a few episodes where measurements don’t match. Some people will say prices are higher than a regular thrift shop, but hey, you are paying for the convenience of browsing online and all other costs associated with running the operation!",5
405,"Curating with love for the environment is fun: A great sustainable alternative to buying new! I went extremely minimalist after having the typical problem of “my wardrobe is so extensive I have nothing to wear.” I didn’t know about ThredUP back when I was doing my cleanup otherwise I would’ve loved to use them then. Now I’m slowly building my wardrobe back to a bit smaller than before; using ThredUP to find pieces that I love has been so much fun. Everything I’ve ordered has fit as expected and the quality has mostly matched. I did get a pair of leggings that were listed at “Excellent condition/like-new” that had a hole on the back side on the inside seam - an easy thing to overlook, and to fix, but that’s the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. That won’t deter me from continuing to curate through ThredUP. I think this is a great system overall and am so glad it exists!",4
406,"Might not be for all sizes: The app itself is fine, in that the design is lovely and the interface is easy to figure out. My issue is with how things are sized. As someone with a disproportionate body, I couldn’t find anything for myself. I normally wear between medium and large dresses/shorts/blouses because my bust is very large, but my hips are very slim, and I’m really short. So, choosing “medium” as a size would come up with lovely things that would never fit my bust, and “large” would bring things up that would swamp me. I wish there would be an option to choose sizes by measurement.

And speaking of the selection for large women, I don’t think there’s much variety. I know it’s not the fault of the app itself, because it’s people who ultimately sell their own things, but I was dissatisfied with what I was seeing. 

So I think this app is good for a certain demographic. But as for me, I probably won’t be using the app again.",3
407,"Garbage: No way this has 4.7 reviews! Been using the site for over 3 years and you know what remains the same? They charge you almost 12$ to ship “faster” and still don’t get your items for almost 2 weeks! I get stuff faster from TEMU having to be air lifted from another country so not only are they robbing people of their resale but they’re making a fortune on shipping. Total rip off! Last order was 3/9 expected delivery 3/18 and I specifically paid extra shipping to avoid the whole “consolidation”. 3+ items in the past have been damaged and dry rotted also multiple items have been petite but not listed that way, thankfully I have a daughter in law that is petite because you sure can return anything without paying another small fortune to return it if it’s even a returnable item which most isn’t. I’m deleting it as soon as my last order comes and NEVER using it again and I’m going to sit back and watch these scammers go down in a blaze of fire.",1
408,"Love it.: I love ThredUp. I’m giving 5 stars because I’m very happy with all of my experiences with them. I have bought MAAaaany items, and sold a few, with them. I’ve found the returns process to be easy, when necessary. I think the app is fantastic. I’m not sure I’ll EVER stop using ThredUp. 
I would also suggest two things: 1. I am desperate for ThredUp to carry men’s clothing.... please please please is this something you can start?!? My husband would be as well-dressed as I am!  2. Is it possible to see when an item will time out?  Sometimes things disappear from the possibilities and I’m sure it’s because they haven’t sold. I respect, you can’t keep things up forever; maybe a countdown timer would be something to convince people to “buy before it’s gone?” Still love it. Thank you for being!",5
409,"Just okay: Customer service is a real pain; it being that you have to use text to communicate on pst. At first the customer service agent that I was using one didn't wanna give me any refund on the shorts that were missed labeled. They were supposed to be Tory Burch and said they were torrid plus size shorts, which is a big difference in price and then she didn't wanna give me anything off on the shirt either because the shirt was not listed as sheer, but it was completely sheer, so I have to buy a tank top for underneath it. Then I talked to a second agent and at least this person was willing to work with me on the shorts and the shirt and then I got a package in the mail and the dress didn't fit, and the shoes are kind of awkward and I have to pay 399 restocking fee plus whatever they're charging me for shipping to ship the dress back. It's a real hassle on this website.",3
410,"Great App! One Small Suggestion: I am a huge fan of thredUP, and tell my friends about it as often as I can. The app is very easy to use and I love their rewards program. The amount of listings available is incredible, and I realize how much effort is involved with continuously posting new items. My one suggestion to make the app even better is to include photos of the item’s tags, if they exist, within the listing. Sizing varies from brand to brand, so for those familiar with a specific brand’s sizing, seeing the tag would be very helpful. A lot of times the size is more of a sure thing for me as a consumer than the measurements to really understand if the item would fit me. It could also help as the thredUP team is posting descriptions of a particular item. I hope this suggestion was helpful!",4
411,"My Most Favorite Shopping Experience: I have loved ThredUp since I started seeing it advertised a few years ago. In that time I have probably purchased close to 100 items (all thought out and curated things thanks to the option to heart items) and have only had to return a few things. 

I have always been a fan of consignment shopping and the thrill of the hunt which admittedly probably makes the process easier- if you know what you’re looking for it’s easier to find. Everything has arrived in fantastic condition and never lesser condition than advertised. I always look forward to my next polka dot package arrival :). 

My only gripe is from a selling standpoint; I am much more selective about what I send in now and always request/pay for the return assurance as the company is selective about what they take and imo don’t pay out a ton, however in turn offer a well cared for and rightly priced product for resale, so as a consumer I can’t complain. 

It can be frustrating that they don’t have a phone contact/call center, but if you can get past that and ok with a livechat set up, the company is incredibly responsive and helpful. 

All in all- five stars for ThredUp, my closet and I appreciate you!",5
412,"Love this app: I love this website and the app is a breeze. I have done all my children’s back to school shopping here this year and have been using ThredUp for years. I have saved hundreds of dollars compared to shopping at retail stores and I’ve saved so much time not having to go anywhere to shop. My items always come as described and are always in fabulous condition. My only gripe is with shipping. If you order a lot of items it takes awhile to process and get all your items in gear for shipping. Placing an order on the 5th and still not having tracking info by the 10th is a little aggravating. I also realize I am spoiled with 1 day shipping anymore from other sites, so all in all the shipping I’m sure is fair.",5
413,"Don’t send your high-end items to these thieves!: I sent a packed clean out bag, could hardly close it, which was 75% hardly worn, perfect condition, quality designer names. Out of, at the least, 60 items they accepted 10 items!!! I wasn’t expecting them to accept the majority, but I could not believe that they did not list more of the beautiful items I sent. I clean out my closet every month. I do not keep old out of style clothes. Yet, when you shop on thredUP that’s the majority of what you see! Makes you wonder where your quality garments are really ending up once they receive them! I’m not happy with this experience, and once I receive the payout from the 10 items they accepted, I’m deleting the thredUP app and telling everyone I know about this rip-off experience! 

BY THE WAY, in reading the reviews I found thredUP’s responses to not even address the complaints the women had. IN OTHER WORDS, they send the same response whether it fits the complaint or not! Unbelievable!! THEY DONT CARE, GIRLS! You’re being ripped off!!!",1
414,"Never again: I was initially impressed how easy, efficient and well documented the items I am selling. Simply put everything in the bag and they take picture of every single items. But it stops there. Their payout for each items is so minimal and they don’t show records of returned items. They promote free shipping for purchases over $75. But they charged me shipping even after purchasing over $ 90 and there is no way to dispute it. It’s win win for them but not for the sellers. It won’t take too long until customer to continue to feel used. Their business will diminished. I recommended family members and I did not get their promotional incentive either. When there is no accountability on their part, I am not staying around to continue to be taken advantage.",5
415,"ThreadUP will steal your most expensive items and then sell them months later: ThreadUP has a history of taking my and others most expensive items, often new with tag or like new, and not listing them for reasons they won’t explain! Only for the exact item to show up “for sale” a few weeks later. At the same time, they list items that should have been trashed: items with period stains, holes and rips, literal trash. The “quality control” is a complete joke. They will steal your stuff to make a profit of it and then sell you trash and ask for you to pay a fee to returned the trashed items they sold you. I’ve had multiple items where the tag is still clearly on still in the listing photo not listed as “new with tag” but they will sell something listed as “very good” condition when it has another person’s blood on it. Their customer service is non responsive. Don’t put yourself at risk, plenty of other places for thrifting!",1
416,"Selling is a joke.: This place is okay to buy from but you’re going to pay for overpriced items that may or may not pan out. When you recycle your items with Thred Up, they take about 4 months to process your items and then they pay you about $1-2 per item IF it sells. After that they own the item and I’m sure they continue trying to sell it for their own profit before they recycle it. If they take 4 months to process, they owe the seller that amount of time to sell the item before they claim ownership. If you want an item back because you think it’s being undervalued, you have to “buy it back” for a portion and I’m sure you pay the full price of shipping. I don’t recommend this app for selling clothing. They’re only willing to pay you a decent amount for higher priced items and those are less likely to sell.",3
417,"More filters please: When I have 6 filters in place and there's still 11,249 results, it's time for more filters. For example, I'm looking for sleeveless but not spaghetti straps. Also I can't tolerate 100% wool but maybe a wool blend?  Also I really want to see the details on dark/black items better. When I do purchase dark items, it's often a surprise what arrives because I can't see much in the photo. Other desirable filters: Dry clean=yes or No. Heel size =0 or heel size <1 inch. Water resistant or proof or ""not available"" for items like shoes and jackets. And in the description for skirts and dresses, it'd be lovely to know if they are lined or not. For an item like a wallet, would be excellent to have a pic of the inside. Oh! And for the goodie boxes, body shape (eg pear) and skin tone (eg pale, olive, honey) could improve item selection...? Thanks",4
418,"Fix your shipping issues guys!: I love the app. Love the concept. I have found some great stuff.  But for the love of god the shipping and subsequent tracking is enough to make a person abandon the whole thing. At this point in time with the technology available to us all, there’s no reason for 1. A box to take 5 business days to even make it into the mail. 2. Tracking to not be kept up to date and more accurate (my packages are all and have all been sitting in commerce ca for 4 days now, with one of them scheduled to have arrived at my house yesterday) If the company you are using to ship has received this many complaints, pick another company. Shipping doesn’t have to be expensive nor does it need to take this long and be this frustrating. Please please please get this worked out. I would do so much more shopping with you guys if I could count on accurate and timely shipping times.",3
419,"Debating if clean out bag worth it: I sent one clean out bag with some not-worn items with tags & those items being rather expensive.  Supposedly 75% of my bag was accepted.  Most of my items sold immediately.  My payout:  $3.00. Probably the cost of my gas to take the clean out bag to Fed Ex.   ThreadUp got a very good sized chunk of money from my items that sold.  I realize ThredUP has expenses in order to sell, but my payout is ridiculous.  I think I’ll stick to taking my used items to Salvation Army or GoodWill. I’ll feel better doing that.   My plan was to make a little $ in order to buy off of ThredUP but the $3.00 won’t even cover the shipping cost of a purchased item & there are no items listed for $3.00. The prices are sometimes more than what the item would cost brand new from a department store.  I also noticed that ThredUP sells on EBay .  I believe the ThredUP eBay items are listed with free shipping while the cost of shipping on ThredUP site is pretty hefty.  I prefer eBay.",2
420,Only place I get my clothes now: I love the big sales they have all the time! Lots of good clothes many still with tags. I’d say the clothes I get are 8/10 hit or miss. With miss being the arms are too small or something. They have high standards for the clothes they do accept so you won’t get something with rips and tears (unless that’s the style) they also have designer items!! Highly recommend to save some money and the environment! The clothing industry and fast fashion is the worst when It comes to the health of the environment! I’ve had this app for over two years now and at first the clothing was a little bit cheaper but I suppose they upped their standards and have to cover inflation costs and whatnot. Still my favorite place to shop!,5
421,"Shipping, selling and organizing need work: Firstly - lower these freaking prices these clothes always have an odor and are used so why are they more expensive than higher quality, brand new pieces???
I sent thredup a bundle and barely had noticed that they finally processed it and my brand new $400 dress from mirae Paris that I had sent them was listed as assorted brands casual dress for twenty dollars, I got $3 from them and cried about it because that was sad. I can’t select a price range in the app and it would be nice if shipping didn’t take ages my stuff always is just in GA for days on end, and a lot of the sizing is inaccurate. Also, you can’t sort through favorites with any filters which takes forever to find things. Still so upset about my beautiful dress that didn’t fit me that I gave up seriously $3 probably never doing a clean out again.",3
422,"Good business concept but item description needs improvement: I love the idea of thread up so I gave it a shot. Overall, it’s alright. I would’ve given it 5 starts if the teams could do better with customer support and item description. I’m petit woman (XXS) so I often wear big girls (14-16) items. A lot of the girl sized items I sent were tagged as adult women size 14-16, which is incorrect. I’ve reached out to their CS and requested to update incorrect description. Multiple times. They said they passed it on to the team in charge but even after weeks they never got updated. I wouldn’t say it’s entirely because of item description, but most of my items didn’t sell. Disappointing, since the business concept is great and I would’ve loved someone else to reuse my items which would help reduce waste. To achieve that and for higher customer satisfaction, they need to ensure accuracy in every item description. Hope they see it as growth opportunity and work to improve it quick.",1
423,"Very hard to place the order: Just trying to place this order yesterday. It did not went through. Many of the items were removed from the cart because I was long hours in the site trying to checkout without success. “Try again”was the message displayed. I went to the chat and the representative recommended to check my card with the bank. I knew that there were any problem because I haven’t have-never ever-a problem with the bank because I know how to manage my credit. I told her that, but she insisted that It was the step recommended. So I left the site. Today I entered again, found a couple of pieces and make the checkout in minutes. What happened yesterday?  Don’t know.",5
424,"Great concept!: Who would have thought an online used clothing store would work??  ThredUP did it though!  I love that I can get name brand clothing, purses, and shoes for a fraction of the retail price.  Just about everything is in great condition too, sometimes it’s brand new!  (Of note, I did receive a pair of pants that had a lot of pilling between the thighs but you can return most items. They tell you if an item is returnable so be sure you check that!) The payout for selling items isn’t so great, but my other alternatives are to go through the hassle of selling it myself, or giving it away.  🤷🏻‍♀️ I also love the feature on the app where you can swipe to see the pictures of an item without actually opening the item.",5
425,"Not a good experience.: I love the idea and convenience of thredUP and their system. However, I do NOT like how they don’t tell you up front about the flip side on the goody boxes. For the $10 goody boxes they charge you $10 before they ship out your box, they then send a return label for the items you don’t want to keep in the goody box. They tell you on the receipt paper you will be charged the items you keep and the items are regular retail price. I have a huge feeling this is why they stopped the goody box subscription because they don't release this information up front and received too many complaints or request to cancel or return their items, most people would not be interested in a subscription knowing they would pay full price for the items they wanted. The items I decided to keep were in great condition but i would never pay full price for. Customer service is not responsive and vague. And most listing prices are retail priced.",1
426,"Love the entire concept but the app has looots of serious issues: So I have been loooving thredUP because it is a super easy process to get second hand clothes and to send (for free) your clothes so you can sell them on there. Love all of that but! The entire app seems to have some flaws as of October 26th 2021. I have sold a bunch of clothes but still haven’t received the money on my account balance (after a month) and then the system seems to have a problem keeping up with the changing in your balance. I made a return and instead of adding on to the small amount of money I had on there, it just gave me only the money I was refunded. Now it looks like I lost the money I made while selling my items… so kinda poopy on that side. That’s why I am giving a three star to the app and not to the actual concept. The concept is great though.",3
427,"I’ve spent too much $$$ 😁: I adore thredUP!  Over the last two years I’ve lost a significant amount of weight and thredUP made it possible to keep my closet full while I lost weight. Now I’m totally into it and may just need an intervention or 12 Step program because it’s getting out of hand!  But, I am one of the best dressed women in my office. I love I can get high end clothing and shoes at low end prices. 

For the most part, everything I’ve purchased has been great. A couple pair of shoes had sizing/wear issues and a couple handbags were more “worn” than expected. Once I receive a top that was brand mislabeled but it worked out, as I liked the mistake better than the one I initially ordered. 

I do wish there were more angles in the photos. I just received a great dress that has embellishments down the side and they were not visible in the photo and not mentioned in the description. It turned out great because it adds to the dress. I would recommend taking photos of any noted “damage” to items.  I also wish there was a way to sort/filter what I have in my favorites. 

Only once did I need to contact customer service and they were extremely helpful. 

I highly recommend thredUp!",5
428,"WORST Company Ever: I am honestly beyond irritated with this company. Terrible customer service, horrible response time, and they employ people who clearly have no clue what they’re doing or talking about. I have bought several items from them that state they are in brand new condition that have stains and marks that you would have to be blind not to see. They show you two photos of the items and do not show up close pictures of them, so it’s easier to get scammed by them. They have misbranded several items, even as far as advertising a Vera Wang sweater as a Free People one! Some of their prices are just outrageous for things that they purchase for literally 25-75 cents! This company is taking advantage of people and probably just hoping that their mistakes will be overlooked. It’s disgusting and I’m sick and tired of this happening. Please don’t support this greedy company—support your local thrift stores that either give back to the community or help people in need.",1
429,"Terrible Service: DO NOT USE: DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! SCAM!! 

I brought clothes from Thredup and upon seeing that my secondhand clothes can be sold too through a clean out bag, I ordered one and send my secondhand clothes there thinking that the ones which aren’t accepted will be send back. I was totally wrong and after reaching out to customer service, they said that you need a “return assurance” in order for your clothes to be send back. There is no information about this “return assurance” when I ordered the kit, nor when I read through the kit and the payout. So basically out of 15 or so of clothes that I send in, only 6 were listed and the rest of my good clothes were thrown away. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied. 
This app is scam. I know that all my clothes were in good condition but this app just want to keep all the good clothes to make the profit for themselves rather than list them to sell. I regret using it and I will not recommend it to anyone!",1
430,"Lack of care for customers: If you want to shop but don’t have the newest phone or programming available to you, the company doesn’t care about your business.  I was just told I’d have to wait until I upgraded to shop here.  To me that means it’s not going to happen any time soon as my phone and computer work fine and I won’t spend $600 on a new phone just so I can shop here to save a few dollars especially when there are so many other places to shop that care enough not to just dismiss me saying I’d have to wait until I have the newer software (as per customer service chat person).  I will also be posting about this on every social media platform I am on so others know not to waste their time.  It’s a shame they let me spend over $200 on the first of 2 orders I was placing but I saved over $200 by not being able to place the second half of my order. Not to mention the money I could have spent in the future.",1
431,"Extremely slow to process kits-I'm done.: I've been using Thred Up for a few years to consign clothing. The Clean Out Kit processing has gotten significantly slower. The last 2 bags I sent in were about 3 months to process and the 2 current kits I have there are in excess of 3 months and still not processed. I honestly don't even remember what was sent in at this point! I will be thinking twice about using Thred Up again for futures closet clean outs. Just too slow.

Edit: kits finally processed in January-most items placed in ""Final Sale"" and unlike my previous kits a very low acceptance. Items had a very short window for sale before they were either offered to be reclaimed or sent to their thrift section.  Only 2 pictures added very minimal descriptions and not a lot of useable details. 

These are the last kits I will send.  ThredUP has lost their direction and really needs to relook at their business model.",2
432,"ThredUP has fake rack prices!!!: I am very tall and VERY thin, so buying clothes has always been hard. But ThredUP allows me to look for the clothes that I know already fit and buy them in every style for a good price. The prices are only GOOD, the prices they have listed as the original garment price are just lies! I love Tommy Hilfiger and frequently buy things from their store for full price. My favorite dress was not 130$ it was only WAY less! I did not buy it on sale either! The store prices are so fake so that they can make you feel like you are paying a good price, when reality the thrift store prices are only as good as TJMaxx. The only reason I keep shopping at ThredUP is because I can buy up the alternate colors of the clothes I already have. They have good discounts frequently though!",4
433,"Great place to shop with a few minor hiccups: I really like that it’s easy to get amazing clothes for cheap and that it helps the environment. I like that returns are super easy so the clothes don’t go to waste. In that way it’s much better than sites like Poshmark. 

However, there are a couple of critiques that I have.

My biggest one is that their measurements for bust in dresses and tops are not always accurate. For example, I’m a plus size girl with a 44 DD, and with dresses and tops, because there’s no indication of whether the top stretches or not, I sometimes have to gamble on whether a top will be big enough for me. I’ve bought tops that say it has a 35” bust that fit me perfectly, and others that have a 40” bust that were too tight. There needs to be a description of how stretchy it is and what the top stretches to.",4
434,"Used to love ThredUP: I used to love shopping through ThredUP until I started receiving wrongly listed items as a start. Then the prices started getting jacked up on items that you can go to the store and buy brand new on the clearance rack for less money. They state gently used clothes, you receive them and the clothes look like the previous owner and all their sisters wore it but it’s a non-returnable item so you end up discarding it. Oh let’s not forget to mention you send items in to sell and when it does you don’t get paid for it! Or you order something they tell you if you haven’t received it within 14 days of your purchase to contact them and they give you a different timeframe and a nonsense excuse but you can clearly see that the item is in your state of residence and has been for some time. ThredUP has become a joke! I used to advocate for them and now I wouldn’t even refer someone down on their luck to them, I’d just take them shopping.",1
435,"A thrifters dream!: Do you love thrifting but hate spending hours searching through ugly clothes only to end up not finding anything you were looking for or your size? Thred Up fixes that problem. As much as I love the thrill of the hunt when thrifting IRL, Thred Up opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Thred up is great when you are looking for something specific and don’t want to support the fast fashion industry. You can find luxury, high quality clothing for a fraction of it’s cost brand new. I absolutely love Thred Up and love that each item has it’s exact measurements so you can avoid an ill fitting piece. I have yet to purchase an item that didn’t end up fitting me or wasn’t as described. Thred Up is my go to for all my online shopping.",5
436,"Has good options but needs to work on customer service and satisfaction: I love the options and the idea behind thread up but the customer service is hard to contact and it takes them a long time to reply. I ordered a goody box from them and it is taking so long to get put together and ship I am not sure if I will ever get it.

Update: I got my box about a month after ordering it. The clothes I got were awful. I had told the styles that I was a new mother and I unboxed my clothes when my mom was visiting. I picked up one shirt and my mom said “hey your grandma had that shirt.” The other clothes were old styles from Kohl’s, VS and Maurices. All in good shape but older. New styles of the same clothes are on the clearance rack at Kohl’s for half the price for half the price. I contacted (or attempted to again...) customer service to see if they would credit to my $10 account to buy some clothes that don’t assume that becoming a  a mother means you need to dress like a grandma.",2
437,"Don’t thrift here: I had been using the app mostly for shopping and other than a few items that were wrongly advertised, I had a good experience. 
However, I had the worst experience thrifting. The app fails to show thrifters that they will be charged $5.99 per item they reclaim at the end of the sale period. It seems like the website is much more out front with this information. However, the app will only show this once you “reclaim your item”. I contacted their customer service and I got a quite rude response from agents stating that I should have searched through their FAQs for this information. When I questioned why other fees are clearly stated to sellers but not this per item fee, I received no response.
I am not sure what is worse, the lack of information or their dismissive customer service. 
I used to put in a order about once every two months, I have now deleted the application and will never shop with them again.",1
438,Clean Out Bag: My clean Out  Bag was received at the beginning of July it still have not been processed. I should’ve known better I work for thredUP warehouse located in Phoenix on Buckeye Road. I was a merchandiser I would process bags that have been sent in seven months prior they never ever keep enough help because they don’t pay enough but they have enough money to go public trading….. and the way that they reward their workers for doing a good job is with sandwiches bags of candy…And forget about a raise in pay … The people who have been there 5+ years make the same amount as a new hire….Be careful buying those expensive bags because they are not processed correctly what you think it’s a Gucci could actually be a Poochie….How can a 30 minute long class prepare you for authenticating expensive bags….smh,4
439,"Potentially fun but overpriced: I’ve noticed the prices on clothing become much higher over the years. I just purchased $300 worth of clothes and shoes and I was disappointed with the state that they were in. Shoes were well worn and odorous despite being categorized as barely used. Items are returnable but the fees and hassle of shipping within 14 days of obtaining the items make it very inconvenient for the customer. At this point I would recommend being absolutely certain of your purchase before buying, because the return process is not convenient and you lose more money on the fees, whereas if you were to walk in to a store and try on and buy new, it might be a better option and you might save money and time in the end.

 I like the eco friendly aspect but please vet the clothes more, don’t accept items with smells…",3
440,"ThredUP just keeps slipping: This company used to be fantastic! Unfortunately, it seems like everyone in present management is coasting on the company’s past success, and not paying attention to  how slack ThredUP has become. 
Orders are being shipped with missing items, descriptions of clothing are frequently inaccurate, and reaching someone in customer service is all but impossible. I have been a devoted customer for ten years, and am so saddened to see a beloved institution fall apart. It is quite obvious that the original management practices are no longer being followed. What the heck happened? You once had a fabulous business model that created legions of happy customers. I’m certain that most of those customers are now long gone.",5
441,"Fun and sustainable: Thread up is built on the premise of reducing landfill waste which I love...but I also love clothes and fashion.  It so cool that you can sift through by brand, size, and condition.  I have found some of my FAVORITE  PIECES on the app.  Unique and rare mint condition finds from seasons past, current buys, and brands that are so hard to find in brick and mortar locations at awesome pricing. Returns are a Snap.  So easy, I do it all the time and have never had a problem.  The closet clean out option has been great for me bc I hate the idea of whatever I donate making its way into the garbage.  You just fill the bag up and ship it out! Do you get a ton of $$ back for your stuff? Depends.  But that’s true w all consignment.  The ease and reliable quality that thread up offers is something I’ve come to trust.",5
442,"So sad: I have used this app for nearly 4 years. I loved it!! Even during the pandemic things slowed down but it was understandable. I have ordered two packages in the last two months and they have taken weeks (over 3 weeks) to receive. I ordered two items in one package and three or four in another. When I sent a bag in they used to issue a credit based on what they thought they would sell it for, ie American Eagle jeans I got $7-10. This last time it did not credit my account for 6 months and I received $2!! The pandemic excuse is over and now it’s just poor customer service through the chat, poor turnaround time, poor shipping/processing. It’s been 17 days since my order and I am still waiting with no resolution. When my two items come I will be deleting this app, not promoting how much I loved it and how easy it was to use as a buyer and a seller. What a headache!! I would rather drive to 10 goodwills and search there for clothes!!",1
443,"Shop Other 2nd Hand Sites Not ThredUP: Don’t waste your time or money with ThredUP. They will sell you second hand items and state they are in good condition. Upon arrival if items are not in the condition stated, perhaps ripped up or stained, not only will ThredUp ignore your request for a resolution, but they will also charge you to send back the damaged items to return if they are returnable as not all items are. And they don’t offer any contact other than email so you will never speak to an actual person if you have a need. Your emails will just go unanswered. This is not a company I recommend to anyone to shop with. There are plenty of other reputable second hand sites to shop from that have much better customer service! I wish I would have just remained with those instead of wasting my money with ThredUP. PS: Clean out kits DONT send them in!!!!! You will wait for ever for processing and selling to get paid for them. Months and months!!!!!!",1
444,"Bundle & GREED: It appeared the only way to finish my transaction was to tap the text with the word BUNDLE but now it appears the item I paid for will be held for 7 days before it ships! Additionally, after the 7 days, I won’t be getting the free shipping as it falsely noted in my cart. This BUNDLE information is NOT prominently shown or explained in a way the busy shopper will see or understand until it’s too late. 

I am NOT happy they immediately received my money but now I won’t get my item for a couple weeks and I’ll lose the FREE shipping (from what I understand, they will add an extra charge to my card without my permission) which was an exciting selling point for me. This BUNDLE  thing is misrepresented and added in areas of the sales process to hook people into buying and then they tell you the whole truth about ‘BUNDLE’. 

I will not shop THREDUP again because they skate the edge of false advertising in their quest to make sales!",2
445,"Lost their touch and they sell fakes: I used to sell with them often, but they don’t have the same touch that they used to. 

Of my last two orders, I received a tank top with deodorant stains all over. It was impossible that several employees went through the the process of going through the bag bag, photographing the item, storing it, and then packing it up to be shipped without anyone having seen how disgusting this top was. I figured, “I guess mistakes happen?” They comped the item, and I ordered again. 

In the next order, I got a FAKE Lululemon tank! It was so obviously fake all I had to do was put my hands on it to know. When I contacted customer support and provided photo evidence, she said “I don’t know anything about that” and then proceeded to tell me that they have rigorous standards and employees are highly trained. That’s obviously not true if 2/2 orders I had issues. I worked at a consignment store and have training in authentication and she talked down to me like I was brain dead. They still made me go through the process of returning the item, waiting for my refund, and took my rewards points away. I didn’t even get a “hey! We’re so sorry this happened! Thanks for pointing it out to us!” And I’m pretty sure the top went back on the floor. 

Such a scam. They obviously have no idea what they’re doing. If they can’t spot fake Lululemon, I have no faith that they can spot fake luxury.",1
446,"I am IN LOVE with ThredUP: I can’t stop thrifting. I started shopping with ThredUP online in 2015 and have recently been using the app to shop lately. I’m addicted to the high of finding an item that is just right and getting polka dot presents from myself at my door. The bundling option is also amazing because I’m always finding something else that I want after I had already placed an order. I LOVE that I can use ApplePay with the app (get that cash back!). The only thing that I would change in the app is that I can’t access the ThredUP Outlet. Sometimes that is the best place to find some last minute amazing items or basics, and I’m bummed that I can only access Outlet through the website. 
Otherwise, 10/10 recommend ThredUP. I’m always striving to wear 100% thrifted items.",5
447,"Got my first order today!!!: Got my first order today. And I’m THRILLED! I got some heels I wore today, which I haven’t even worn heels in awhile and LOVE them. Got 4 things for my 10 yr old and I am so pleased the things were better in person! One top in particular has a unique part on the back of it that I wasn’t even aware of and it’s precious! I can’t wait for my second order to come! And all the things I got today (plus a cute black n red skirt for me) besides the heels those were actually ordered with the other things I’m waiting on were all like 2.99! And my other order was insanely affordable as well. I found my new go-to place!! I definitely recommend buying from ThredUP! I’m also going to send some things in to see about selling- so we’ll see how that goes! 😊💕👍🏼",5
448,"I have not shopped in a retail store for over a year: Ok- I did buy underwear and bras new, and a pair of jeans,  but otherwise pretty much every piece of clothing I bought in the last year has been from thredup. I love it because it’s great quality stuff at a great price, fun way to discover new brands, more convenient than fighting for parking in the mall and paying full price. I also like the lower impact on the environment - it feels to give like-new clothes a second life. We throw away so many clothes and shoes that are perfectly good. It’s like shopping a fashionable friend’s closet, endlessly. They do charge low return fees but the savings overall are still well worth it. Good customer service when something goes wrong.  I’m a fan for life.",5
449,"DO NOT SELL CLOTHES ON THIS APP: I used to be a satisfied customer when I bought things from this app, despite the few inconveniences with sizing issues etc. I have never given a one star review, but my experience with selling on thred up warrants it. To sell on thred up, they send enormous bag (~ 3 x 2 ft) to fill with  as many clothes as you’d like. I had a lot to give away, so mine was packed. I had about 20 to 30 articles of clothing, and some were designer (Ralph Lauren etc.) If I had sold it anywhere else, I probably would have gotten at least 10 or 15 dollars - modestly. After you mail it, thred up is supposed to take care of everything, take a commission, and give you money or credit. For EVERYTHING I sent in, I got 39 cents. That’s it. I wouldn’t give a one star review over a lost ~10 dollars, but the company made it seem as if I would receive at least a fair price for my 20/30 clothes, and I’m no expert, but 30 cents for everything (a literal penny per piece of clothing) seems like a rip-off. Never sell with thred up.",1
450,"ThredUp is my one stop shop: Nearly everything I have in my closet is from this site. As a mom, I have a hard time spending money on clothes for myself, but they have such great deals, I can buy a whole new wardrobe without feeling guilty. Now I buy my daughter’s clothes from here too! She’s entering those years where labels matter, and fashion is extremely important. We window shop together for her clothes, but because of the wide variety of options, she gets to pick out what she actually likes. I just save her sizes and let her shop. She feels independent, I know what she’s getting, win/win. Also really love that they work with Affirm!!! So I can easily finance a new wardrobe in monthly payments! Thank you ThredUp for everything!",5
451,Awesome concept!: The ONLY reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because an order was cancelled without my permission. Upon further investigation with the company they let me know upon their final inspection of the item I purchased had a flaw they were made aware of and because of their high standards they didn’t want to ship it to me and I be dissatisfied (which I do appreciate) however I wish they could’ve let me know what the flaw was before canceling my order because it may have been something that I could’ve fixed myself or overlooked. Because of that cancellation I was charged a minor return fee from my billing company. But THRED UP gave my money off my next purchase because of that incident (thanks again THRED UP!) So I most certainly WILL continue thrifting with them! GREAT COMPANY!!!,4
452,"Sadly Downhill, no way to contact, do not send them anything!: I have used ThredUP for years and used to love them. It was a great way to get unique clothing at a great price. The last couple times I ordered though, things were not in “like new” condition as stated, but the worst is I sent them a clean out bag full of like new and new with tags items which they say they received in February and it is now June and they still haven’t processed it. Either they lost it or intend to sell my items without paying me. Either way it’s not only horrible service but there is absolutely no way to contact them on their site. They say they will return emails in 6-7 days, which aside from being entirely too long, they don’t actually do. I emailed over a month ago. Nothing. Then I see scores of complaints on the internet from other people in the same predicament. Maddening. It’s basically thievery. If this place isn’t shut down within the year I will be shocked.",1
453,"Used clothes: I’ve never thought I would like buying used clothes. When I first found Thred Up, I was skeptical, and I COULDN'T believe when my first  beautiful poka dot box was delivered AND every single piece of clothing I ordered, I LOVED! I get compliments every time I wear anything from Thred up!! I am completely satisfied. I have to put this, the dresses I bought, look just like I bought them from the store, not one item I have purchased looks used. Give it a try, no one can be more skeptical than I was, & they have won me over! Do your work, put your size in for tops, pants, shoe size. I actually have two sizes marked for tops, that way they show more of both sizes. I have never sent one piece of clothing back, because I love them all.",5
454,"Trust worthy: I like Thread Up, because I can rest assured, when I receive my item, the quality will be EXACTLY as what they described.  I’ve NEVER had a problem with ANY purchase. The customer service, so far has been great. I tried Poshmark, & paid good money & received  2 juicy couture KNOCK OFFS. It was HELL getting my refund.  After MULTIPLE E-mails to them, NO REPLY. I finally called my credit card company & got the money back.  Went on line & found NUMEROUS bad reviews from multiple sites.  HAVEN’T run into any regarding THREAD UP. What was interesting, when I was disputing that purchase, before I could say the company, they said, “Is it Poshmark?’  I was surprised, & said “yes”.  He said, “We get tons of complaints about them.” I asked if they get any disputes regarding THREAD UP. He said, “No, I don’t recall any disputes regarding them.”",5
455,"Not much of a bargain: I’ve used ThredUP a few a times now, and my experience has been OK at best. I always end up needing to return something, which may just be the way it goes when you shop second-hand and can’t see the item in person. But if you’re looking for a way to save money, this isn’t really it. The clothing is pricey for second hand, you pay a lot for shipping, and returns are a royal pain (plus you pay a restocking fee for most items). My most recent experience was quite disappointing: I ordered a maternity dress that was labeled “new with tags.” When it arrived, it was clear the original tag had been tied back on, and not well. And the dress itself was covered in food stains. Well—I hope it was food. There was a lot, and it was disgusting. I like the concept of ThredUP, but in the end you don’t get much of a bargain, especially if you need to make a return. I have to be honest: I won’t be using this site again.",2
456,"Very disappointed: I’m very disappointed in ThredUP. So far I have successfully ordered a few things but after the third time they messed up. I had ordered a crossbody bag from fossil which was coming from their store house in Arizona. Well in my orders it said it was delivered but it never was. After emailing someone from ThredUP, she had told me that it was packaged and delivered and that as a “one-time courtesy” she will give me a refund; which tells you they don’t give refunds for THEIR mistakes. They may think second hand shopping is the future but maybe in their future they should fix keeping track of their packaging and making sure EVERYTHING IS IN THE BOX/BAG! They definitely didn’t package it like they were suppose too cause there were no signs of the package opened or even big enough for the purse. I was really looking forward to shopping with ThredUP, but if this more than “rare” you are sadly mistaken. 

Side Note: You need a customer service phone number. It kinda pathetic fixing things over email.",1
457,"Needs more thorough inspection: I know this review should be about the APP itself, but I also have a few helpful comments about the service. First off the app is pretty great, the only problem I’ve ever had is that sometimes when you use the search function, it pulls up zero listings or if you refresh a page it goes to zero. I think this has been fixed though, I haven’t noticed it for a while. 

So as for the service, I give it about 2 stars. The main problem I have besides the high prices is that items are not thoroughly inspected. I’ve made over 10 orders and probably about 40% of the time I buy something that is marked new or like new, it has major flaws. Some of the items had holes, stains, or were visibly dirty (jewelry, bags) without being noted. Please consider scrutinizing your items more, especially if you’re going to resell them for unheard of prices.",3
458,"Faithful Customer no longer: Unfortunately, ThredUP seems to have gotten too big. I used to sell things regularly and received fair prices for my gently used clothing. The past few years, I have made pennies off of what I have given them. As in, maybe 30 cents per item that they have taken (not to mention the things that they haven’t accepted- including several designer items). I never took cash- I always used my buyout to spend purchasing clothing from their website. In fact, I still have $17 to use, but have been reluctant to use them because their prices have gone up, their shipping is extremely high and they don’t offer free shipping unless it’s over $75, and the new restocking fee. I have been a loyal customer for at least 6 years and over the past year I have refused to buy from them. Often times I can get things cheaper brand new from the same stores they are offering. Unfortunately, ThredUP has lost a faithful customer.",1
459,"Online thrift store: I placed two orders today, and even though I cannot review on receiving the items just yet, I will say that this business has SO much stuff. Its like walking through a mall sized thrift store except through your phone. It requires the same patience as actual thrifting and has so many quality items for such a small price. They also have coupons and sales which make it even cheaper and more addictive! I will finish my review after I receive my items but as of right now this is my new favorite clothing app❤️ 
Update: This app is legit, shipping took a bit over a week but less than two weeks. Everything arrived in as stated condition and I could not be more satisfied!",5
460,"I’m Loving ThredUp!: Every since I have heard about this site, I have been searching, shopping and receiving Wonderful clothing, purses, sweaters and outerwear. I’ve found EXACTLY what I have been looking for to upcoming events. 
Even though, we are dealing with Covid a woman still wants to feel her best! 
I’ve been reassessing my entire clothing apparel. You can place an “Order for a Free Kit” to both Donate and Sell gently used/new clothes, to which just doesn’t fit with your personal style, anymore. 
I just done Both. To ensure I can make room for all of the new/used clothes I have purchased from ThredUp! 
ThredUp has taken the hassle of trying to find the “ONE” perfect outfit we’re all trying to find... out of the equation. 
Instead, replaced On-line shopping more consumer friendly. 
I’ve had nothing but, Great Experiences with ThredUp! 
Easy to find great ideas, Fast delivery, easy rewards, great prices on Top Name Brands, Variety of choices and Very addicting! Even my husband loves ThredUp! 
My husband encourages me to buy every single item to which I’ve purchased. 
I have encouraged my friends and family to join ThredUp too.

Thank You ThredUp 
Happy Shopping!",5
461,Amazing but a bit clunky: The quality and detail of each thrift is AMAZING. I have a kind of tricky aesthetic so finding pieces that are key to my wardrobe is amazing and I LOVE how many options and range the website has! Big names to small for a reasonable price— and CONSTANT markdowns and promo codes/ discounts—a DREAM. My only two problems are the filtration process is a bit clunky. I added my sizes (I’m a plus size woman) and I’m still shown petite clothing all the way down to a size zero. It can be VERY disheartening to find a piece you love only to realize the filter wasn’t working. The second issue is that you can’t have two different people order from the same household. I recommend ThreadUP to my mom and she ordered around $100 in stuff and was really excited about it only to get her order canceled because I have an account already.,3
462,"Love the concept, however...: I love shopping resale! I used to work at a resale shop that is the same concept as this. 

 I’ve run across several issues: 1) the sizing is questionable. I purchased a tutu that was indicated as XS for my daughter. XS is like a girls 4-5 or at least that is what some stores classify that as. When item arrived, it said 3-6 months! Uh? That should’ve been stated on the description not XS. Also, I have received something that was sized for a girl not a woman. They should have an option where you can look for clothes based on measurements (esp the bust and waist/hips) 2) when searching under a certain gender, I’ll see an obvious girls shirt in the boys section and an obvious boys shirt in the girls. Not sure if this was meant to happen. 

Other than that, I’ve really enjoyed shopping on the app.",4
463,"Love it:): I’ve had good experiences with thredup the few times I have shopped with them. They have a large selection of clothes and their whole app is simple and easy to navigate. Speaking on their large selection of clothing, I think it would be nice if they provided a feature where customers can drag and drop clothing items they have favorited to a blank “canvas” page to put together outfits! Since there is such a huge selection of clothing, this would be an awesome feature and add an interesting element to the app, especially for the people who shop this way! Then once you put together your outfit then you can just move the whole outfit to checkout. I know this won’t ever happen but imagining it is soo fun!",5
464,"Happy Designing Woman: I’ve been buying from ThredUP for 3+ years and I’m quite happy with the descriptions and quality of the clothes. I buy New with Tags or Like New. I have several favorite classic designers I can’t afford new that I buy here and no one is ever the wiser. I’ve gotten a few pieces that weren’t in as good of shape as promised and I didn’t have any trouble returning them. Shoes can sometimes be an issue; I once got a pair that looked great but turned out to have been dyed and the dye ran. On the other hand, I’ve got 3 pairs of Ferragamo's that I love. I wish on purses they’d post more photos including the interior; I haven’t purchased those. I’ve sold a few things with them mostly out of curiosity, but I decided to start using the donate program since I can deduct that from taxes.",5
465,"Love thredUP!: I absolutely love buying clothes from thredUP! Sometimes you have to hunt a bit, but it pays off immensely in the end. I’ve gotten tons of great pieces for my daily wardrobe, as well as a few fancy dresses and clutches. I’ve also ordered some things I ended up not liking, but the returns are incredibly easy: I just package everything up, print the return label and stick it on the outside, and then have USPS pick it up directly from my doorstep. I sold some items to thredUP, mostly because I know they responsibly recycle the clothes they reject and I just wanted to get rid of them (without throwing them away). The payout was low, but it was actually more than I was expecting. And I managed to get a few really nice items for the money, so definitely a win-win in my book!",5
466,"Buyer beware: I sent them 12 pairs of brand new sustainably made shoes that were worth retail at around $600. They were very exclusive shoes made by a small factory in Chicago called Mohop. You could wear them many ways. I filled out the form saying I wanted them returned if they did not want them. So fast forward months and I see online that they received them. So I tried over and over again to contact them regarding payment or return over a period of 3 months. They never responded till about 3 months had passed and it was an email telling me they had not accepted any of the shoes to sell and did not hear from me so they got rid of them. I was livid that they kept shoes that were supposed to be returned to me and who knows what they did with them. This site is a scam on two levels. If you sell you will get peanuts for your items  if anything, and if you buy what you see is not always what you get. I have read tons of bad reviews so buyer or seller beware. Do not know how they stay in business.",1
467,"Going Down Hill: I have purchased a lot of clothes from ThredUP and in the past have never had any issues. With that being said my last 4 orders were wrong. Whoever is posting the clothes online is not reading the sizes correctly I ordered a pair of 8 jeans they came 8 long, ordered a shirt it was not the correct brand, ordered another pair of jeans (because I could only get store credit back for the item since I didn’t want to pay to ship it back) they came 8 short and they were supposed to just be 8 regular. Ordered a shirt because once again I had to use my store credit and they sent me the wrong size. Sometimes the customer service is very helpful this past time they told me to keep the item they sent me and they would refund all my money. But whoever is posting the clothing online really needs to make sure they are putting the correct sizes!!",3
468,"Expensive!: USED items are being sold on this app for just a few dollars off retail value. These are not thrift store prices. I wouldn’t buy a sweater NEW for over twenty dollars. Support your local charity stores or church thrift shops if you want to make a difference for your community and to the earth. I assure you the prices will be much more reasonable and the proceeds will likely go to people who are in need. ThredUP doesn’t seem to have a particular charity besides advocating for recycling clothing and greener practices, which leads me to believe that they are making a profit off donations. Furthermore, it seemed a little strange to me that they encourage customers to buy used clothing whenever they can, but half of the advertising on the website is dedicated to selling new “I wear used clothing” T-Shirts and other merch probably made by underpaid factory workers in some developing country. I don’t shop at thrift shops for the sake of earning brownie points. I was extremely disappointed and I deleted the app minutes after downloading it.",1
469,"Get your measurements correct!!: I have been using thredUP for a few years now. Initially, they did not always have measurements, so I was happy when they began including them. While they still don’t include them on every item it’s a big improvement from before however… Now there’s seem to be a lot of in accurate measurements. This makes buying online nearly impossible. The only thing I have to depend on, given the wide range that any given size can cover, his correct measurements. I just received my third quarter in a row where an item listed specific measurements, but the actual item’s measurements were not consistent with the description. This makes me very reticent to buy from thredUP.",5
470,"Horrible: I had multiple items from my clean outs that were “missing” when my items were listed. I wasn’t able to change any of the prices. I logged into my account the other day and those items magically appeared and now show as sold. They weren’t listed when my other items went “live” to list. I don’t know how much those actually sold for and what my cut was. I’ll NEVER use this company again and also encourage others not to use it. Of course when I tried to contact customer service, I wasn’t able to on the app. It kept taking me back to the main page to try to contact them. When I went to the website, the link worked but a representative want available. Just a horrible experience overall. When I’ve used them before in the past, I’ve never had a problem like this before. There’s still a dress that I sent in new with tags that still isn’t accounted for. This is a rip off company.",1
471,"Rescue Box - Bulk Mixed Clothing: My first two rescue boxes were amazing. A good mix of designer and mall brands. I especially liked that they had included designer because you don’t find some of those brands where I live (I believe those boxes came from the Arizona and Georgia warehouses). I was so pleased with my first two orders I placed a third order.  What a mistake. There was not one item I could resell, or even give away. I believe this box came from the PA warehouse. A complete waste of money. I was so upset with that order I haven’t ordered anymore since. Which is unfortunate, because I was going to start ordering one a month to save time from driving around to different local thrift stores. I just can’t afford a $60 gamble every month.",5
472,"Terrible: If I could give them no stars I would. They were great before the pandemic but now they try to sell even your new clothes with price tags on them for $1.00. What a scam I will sell my clothes myself and get a better deal. And I will be be closing out the account! Now they send me apology for keeping my clothes and not paying me really? They keep your earnings if you want them to mail your clothes back if they don’t sell what a crock. Talking about donating them if not mailed back to you. I can donate to Goodwill myself I’m trying to sell them not donate them. I’m sure they still end up selling your things that doesn’t sell that’s what they say. I don’t believe nothing they say because they sold some of my things with price tags on them and I have not received a cent! I closed this account and will never used this scam site again! Better off using Marketplace, Offer Up or Next Door at least you get your money on what you sell smh!",1
473,"So Much Good!!: First, I have been using ThredUp for years. My wardrobe is mostly ThredUp clothes. 

Thanks to this app, I’ve been able to find the brands that fit me best, which is important for a 5’ 1” 110 pound shrimp such as myself. 

I love how I can narrow down my searches to find special sizing (petites!), and I can actually find cute clothes that fit me! I can choose to search for something as simple as a white tee shirt but specify the style — crew neck, scoop neck, boat neck, v-neck, off the shoulder, ruched, sleeveless, short-sleeved, 3/4 sleeved, long-sleeved, polka-dotted, graphic, striped... well, you get it! 

They also have great accessories and an amazing selection of designer clothes!

I can’t even imagine how tedious it is for the people who work there to describe each and every garment in such detail, but I appreciate it so very much! It takes thrifting to a whole new level and makes it so worthwhile!! Addicting, even!!

And then there are the bonus points that you can earn for stuff like free shipping or $10 off or waiving the (already reasonable — $1.99) restocking fees! Shipping is free for purchases over $79, If I don’t love my purchase I can return it for free if I choose store credit (worth it!)

ThredUp is the BEST!!",5
474,"Love It so much except for a few little things: I love being able purchase second hand clothing and accessories so easily! I’m definitely getting addicted to this app because it’s easy to use, the prices and shipping are great and I can find things I can’t find anywhere else. My only issues thus far: some items like skirts don’t have waist/hip measurements so it’s almost impossible to know if something will fit. I also find it frustrating that it doesn’t list if something is stretchy or not. You can sorta tell from what it’s made of but it’s not always clear. I’d love to see a description that lists some stretch, no stretch etc. it would help a lot with knowing if something will fit. Also would love to zoom up on pics a little better too to see fabric details. Otherwise, I’m totally loving this app!",4
475,"Missed opportunities to improve search functions: I like ThredUp. I love the overall concept and Goody boxes are fun. But there are several ways the search functions could be improved. I wish you could search purely on measurements rather than numbered/lettered sizes. There is so much variation between brands, plus variation from wash/wear... it just seems obvious to me that searching by measurements would be so much more practical. I understand that some customers may not know their measurements or want to search this way, but you could make the search flexible to allow either method. Also, the search setup currently allows you to search for the criteria selected. However, often I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for, I just know that I DON’T want xyz... It would be great if the search function allowed reverse selections. I.e. show me all women’s tops EXCEPT anything marked orange or with sequins.",3
476,"First Time Using thredUP, would recommend!: I heard about thredUp a couple years ago, but every time I browsed the app, I never saw anything I absolutely needed to have.

Last week I realized I needed to get a couple of new pairs of pants for work so I checked to see if there was anything on thredUp and I found TWO pairs of pants in my size, both exactly what I was looking for: flared leg, high rise, size 16.  

The first pair I ordered was a brown pair of Lauren Ralph Lauren corduroy flare pants, and the other was listed under the Lee brand, but the picture was of a pair of Levi’s denim pants. As both Lee and Levi’s size 16 fit me fine I ordered it anyway.  I read reviews about the listing info being incorrect, but I was hoping whatever I ordered would fit.

Packages did ship separately, the pants listed under Lee’s turned out to be a pair of Levi’s, but they were exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly so no complaints here.  The brown corduroy pants arrived second and they also were just as described and fit great.

I would use thredUp again if I found something I really liked, but it wouldn’t be my go-to spot for buying second hand fashion.  With that said, I would still recommend as it was simple and convenient and I didn’t have any problems with my first order.",4
477,"TERRIBLE Customer Service and Overall Experience!!!: I use to love this app and never had an issue with shipping or anything. I hadn’t used it since 2018 and man, has it gone to sh**! In my first order, I only received two of four packages. The other two still say pending. I got refunded for the items in one of those for some reason so, I assume those aren’t coming. I’m still waiting for the other package. Then, *dummy me* decided to submit another order. That was split into three separate packages. One has been delivered. The other two say they’ve been delivered and they’re NOT here!! I have tried reaching out via the app to have this handled. No one reaches out in response. Instead, I got routed to FAQ page to help answer my concerns. This has been an awful experience and I have lost so much money. Shame on me for wasting my time, energy, and money twice!! I have definitely learned and will NOT shop from this app anymore!!!! ThredUP, I hope you read this and others’ concerns and make them right!",1
478,"Great idea but no follow through: I sent items during the summer and every few months, after I wrote multiple times, they might reply to say my bag still hadn’t been processed. There  is no way to call them to discuss the lack of correspondence. After a negative review today they wrote me that a skirt retailing for over 150, gave me a credit for a dollar and change. I’m supposed to receive a check from my sold items since last summer. Donating items would have been far less aggravating and a donation slip would have made more sense. I tried ordering a few items and I gave a few away. I knew it wouldn’t be worth the hassle of the return. It’s a great concept but customer service doesn’t support what’s needed. Highly disappointed .",4
479,"Used to love but now it’s a hassle: I have spent over $300 shopping this site/app, they have good deals on gently used items and most of the time they are pretty spot on with details. This is why I’ve spent so much! But lately things have been such a hassle. I’ve noticed the last few purchases I’ve made included items that didn’t match the description (being a lot more wear than described) and now I’ve received an order that I never even placed! I was excited thinking I got something in the mail only to find out it is completely not ally all anything I ever ordered, and there isn’t even a mailing slip included like there usually is... I have received two partial orders this morning: one with the correct items and one with incorrect items, both packages missing their slips. And customer service is unavailable. Will I ever even get my items?? Will whoever wanted these dresses I got ever get her items??? Really frustrating knowing there isn’t anyone to talk to for two more days!",1
480,"Lots of fun: I really enjoy scrolling through all the photos of items.  You can save your favorites so you don’t have to go back through everything to find them. And, if they go on sale you get an email letting you know the price has dropped.  It is fun to get a package of things to try on and know that, on average, I’m only spending around $10 per item. Everything has come in great shape.  And, the returns are easy to complete. 
I have looked at purses, but haven’t purchased any yet. I like that you have them on a mannequin so that you can see how it hangs, but could you let us know what the inside looks like?  That helps me decide a lot when I’m buying in a store.  Thanks for happy shopping!",5
481,"Fashion Forward: Innovative company helping you get your fashion on, save money and save the planet from fashion waste! Total win! So impressed with their creative  deals from denim by the pound for crafters to designer picked fashion boxes. Customer service is good, shipping is a little slow but worth it. We’ve saved a ton on our wardrobes for kids and ourselves. Try it, love it or return it. Caution on final sale items, I was able to return a final sale gown that had a hidden tear upon receipt but you’re getting the deal because it’s a clearance item. It was the only time an item had damage, they inspect well before selling. Read the descriptions (especially sellers notes & sizes) and zoom in on photos. Go Pop Some Tags-Happy thrifting!",5
482,"The polka dot addiction: I have been shopping on thredUP for a little over 5 years now and let’s just be honest, ain’t going anywhere. My work wardrobe is a mix of J. Crew, banana republic and LOFT and I generally spend less for an entire outfit on thredUP than I would for 1 item at regular retail. Polished on a budget. 
The other thing I love about thredUP is the idea of recycling clothes. I buy mine at a fraction of the cost, gently wear them, donate them and turn around and get more stuff. I can have new outfits more often because it’s not draining the bank account. 

Oh and the app is crazy easy to use. The thing I would love to see is men’s stuff. The BF loves the concept and constantly asks me “if they have guys stuff now” Love everything about thredUP.",5
483,"Customer service is terrible: I have written them multiple times about problems, questions and what not. All I get is a robotic response. I’ve spend thousands of dollars on their site within the past 2 years. The first purse I bought was a joke. It was a “designer” bag with scuffs and marks all over the place. $60 for nothing. Yes. It was in their “basement” but now they’ve completely changed their polices where you can’t return any bag or wallet. 
They take the pics using small (child) models to make the bags appear larger.  This last one I got had a hole completely thru it and the lining was all frayed. 
I’ve been happy for the most part. But when an issue comes up that a REAL PERSON wants an answer to. Have some class and decency to reach out sincerely and try to rectify the problem.  
I had 2 businesses and it yours client base that pays your salary. Obviously they don’t care about about  that. 
All I wanted was a sincere attempt to make things right. 
I won’t support them anymore.  Which is a shame. 
But not shame on me. Shame on you. Even the biggest of companies can’t take the time to reach out to their customers and try to resolve issues. 
You just don’t care.",5
484,"ThredUp used to be perfect!: I generally love shopping on ThredUp. If you know all of the tricks, you can find amazing deals on the clothes you love but may not be able to afford. Recently, I’ve had problems with the items I favorite not showing up in the favorites tab. I spent a significant amount of time finding sweaters I want for the fall and I can’t find them unless I go back to the original search where I found them where it shows that I had favorited the item.  Currently, the only items in my favorites tab are from around 2-3 weeks ago and it does not allow me to unfavorite an item. If I try, it will keep the item in my favorites. I don’t think this is just an app issue but also a website issue because it does the same thing. I really love using this website but if this problem is not fixed, I don’t think I can continue using it.",3
485,"Overall very good: I’ve just discovered ThredUP recently and have really enjoyed it, using it to find great deals for several members of my family. It’s all the fun of thrift shopping without the hassle of having to actually go to the store! I find myself browsing the site quite often, just for fun. My only complaint is that the filters on the app don’t seem to work as well as they do on the actual website. Things seem to be poorly classified when using app filters (for example, I selected leggings but was seeing mostly dress pants in my results), and the app doesn’t like it when I apply multiple filters for condition (when I selected both “new with tags” and “like new,” I only saw results from one of those categories instead of both). Despite these hiccups, I’ll definitely keep using ThredUP.",4
486,"Best place to shop!: I recently moved from Alaska to Tennessee. Needless to say, I had to buy an entire new wardrobe. Thank goodness I found ThreadUp! I have been able to buy beautiful designer clothes and shoes for unbelievable prices! Most of the pieces were brand new with tags, or barely worn. I absolutely love the ability to narrow down exactly what I am looking for including my sizes and the materials I want my clothes made of. I feel good about making a positive environmental impact choosing to buy used. I discover new brands and see pieces I wouldn’t find marketed in the area I live in. I know I can pick unique and beautiful pieces that I love, and not be limited to choosing from what everyone else is wearing. I highly recommend this app!",5
487,"Shopaholic: I was one that loved to be in-store when shopping. I’m a shorter thin person and have always had a hard time finding clothes that fit me. 
Now I shop daily on the ThredUP app. I can’t seem to ever finish scrolling and finding items I love. 
I never would have thought that I would thrift shop online, I’m here daily though. I never even thought I would check out this app, so glad that I did. Now my friends and I shop here. We actually have to tell each other to stay off the app until a certain date or we will overload ourselves with too many clothes. 
Thank you for making a place to shop and hang out with friends at the same time from the comfort of our own homes.",5
488,"As a customer, Yay! As a consigner, Meh.: As a ThredUP customer, I seldom have reason to buy new clothing. I can purchase all the brands I love, and afford higher end brands that, at full price, are outside my budget (hello $495 Monique Lhuillier gown for $85!).

As a consigner, however, it’s gotten less worthwhile as the payouts have gone from modest to minuscule (even for the premium brands in excellent condition). My first Clean Out kit in 2018 netted a fair return; my recent kits have been worth pennies and now you have to wait through the 30-day return window for a payout. If I want to earn anything, I consign through Poshmark—but that has its downsides. 

So, as a customer, it’s a Yay! Love ThredUP. As a consigner, if I have the time and patience, I’d prefer to work sell with Poshmark.",5
489,"Love the website, app is buggy: I love shopping on ThredUP! It makes thrifting from home incredibly accessible. 

The shopping itself can be frustrating when using filters. I have “My Sizes” set and the sizes show across items., for example, if I’m a size 8 in a dress and size 4 in pants, I’ll get both types of clothing for both sizes if filtered by “My Size.” I have to specifically refine the filters every time I search in order to not see things that won’t fit me. This makes it more work when trying to comb through brands as a whole because I can’t remove any of my sizes at all otherwise I won’t see them for the categories of clothing they actually apply to. 

The app also hasn’t been consistent with clicking through for viewing brands. If I find an item I like and click to see the brand as a whole through that individual item, it will kick me to a view of that entire item category. So in order to look at brands I have to go back and use the search function. 

Please improve the functions of you filters! It’s hard enough to comb through all the individual items as is to find potential purchases. Having to constantly start over or get hyper specific with the selections of the filters is more laborious than it probably needs to be.",3
490,"Worst company ever!: I sent a bag in with 42 items! They received it and processed it and said they would only take 24 items witch was fine. I was expecting a payout immediately! After reading through everything it turns out that you have to wait till one of your items is sold and and even then you have to wait for the person to get it and wait 14 freaking days until their return policy is up to get some money!... So apparently the money isn’t even all at once! So I reached out to customer service (worst experience ever) to tell them to just send my bag back because it’s just not even worth it and they still haven’t replied to me! Also they sent me a list of all the items they accepted and there were links to each item on their website and for all the 24 items, they were going to give me around $30 and I looked at one of the items I sent them and they are trying to sell it for $22!! Unbelievable! This company is the worst! Such a rip off!!",1
491,"Favorite Brands at Fantastic Prices: Thrifting had been aspirational until I found ThreadUp. I don’t have hours to spend in my local secondhand store. I’m 6’1”, and it’s difficult enough to find full-priced clothes that fit. I know which brands work for my body, and ThreadUp makes it easy to locate my favorites, at year-round “black Friday” prices. Everything I’ve received thus far looks practically new. This is my new favorite clothing retailer. 

The unboxing experience is equal to my online luxury brand purchases. Your items come wrapped in cute (recyclable paper), preciously closed with a sweet little sticker, and placed lovingly into a classy box or bag. 

ThreadUp makes you feel good gifting yourself, while taking care of the environment.",5
492,"Great deals if you have patience.: I use the app quite often, but you’ve got to know what you’re looking for and maybe do a little digging on other sites as ThredUP measurement listings are often inaccurate. I often have to lookup the brands website to see what their sizing is supposed to be. Also ThredUP doesn’t show you a side view of the item or list decorative details in the descriptions (I once got a top that I had no idea had a zipper detail running down both sides). Also,  PLEASE LIST IF AN ITEM HAS POCKETS!!
I scrolled looking for black work pants trying to zoom in on every listing to see if there were pockets or not (photos of black items are so dark you can’t see details) until I finally gave up.
I shop ThredUP because I know that there are diamonds to be mined, but the app experience leaves a lot to be desired.",3
493,"Broken: The website is far better than their app. For example they don’t have a very detailed shoe category in the app they don’t have sandals as an option in the category in the app but they do on the website , in the app you can select your shoe size and or clothes size and it will still show you other sizes outside of yours. They also have different condition options on the app compared to the site - the site offers excellent condition the app offers like new and new with tags so which is it Thredup? Also when searching their sandals because I had to type it in in the search bar, compared to the website even tho on the app you can select new with tags the shoes I was showed on the app were ugly and the results from website were varied in different gorgeous styles hard to pick from. Don’t use the app trust me use the website the app needs so many updates to it that they’re just not doing..",1
494,"Started strong, now mediocre: I’ve been using this site for years- I believe in recycling clothing and reducing carbon footprints. I loved it for years- clothing arrived pretty fast, excellent condition & the return process was seamless.  Then it changed— instituting a $3.99 return fee for every piece of clothing.  I have gotten clothing listed as “like new” that have holes, a really strong cleansing smell that they use, clothes that clearly do not match the measurements that were listed (much too small) and yet there’s no one you can reach out to to get an exception made on that fee.
Then comes the delivery.  Man, they have dropped the ball big time.  My last 5 orders were a nightmare.  Says UPS, absolutely no tracking links work, takes 10+ days for delivery (I live 1 state away from their DC).  You cannot get a timely response from their “contact support”.  I email every time and it takes 3 business days to get a canned non response.  The service is awful.",1
495,"Feeds my second hand addiction during the  pandemic: ... but I’ll most likely keep shopping on thredUP forever. I have a few brands I really love and you can save a search and get a notification when a new item gets added. That’s awesome!
Two things I’m missing though when shopping second hand online: it’s hard to find a real bargain if you can’t touch the fabric and see the article. And  the prices can be way too high because the brand and the original purchase price are always known and stated.  In a charity store a sweater is a sweater, on thredUP the Brand dictates the price.
Also, I don’t love the idea of shipping items  back and forth. It’s not entirely in line with environmentally conscious buying behavior. But- nothing’s perfect. Love the app! Love thredUP!",5
496,"Horrible app and worse web site!!!: Ridiculous response from the developer, that completely ignores my complaint!!! The entire app/program/platform is abusive to the user by insisting that the user share their email and/or social media account passwords rather than creating an account using a different password unique to the platform 
Developers response is also nonsensical, really if they thought that they had so many wonderful items for sale, they would not n ed to be parasites and obtain your personal data to set up an account before letting you browse or even scroll to the area that would allow you to contact them or read their privacy policy and TOS. Will not let you even browse without signing up for an account, and worse will only let you create an account ising your email account or a social media account’s password!!! Horrible!!! There are so many more customer friendly places to shop!!!",1
497,"Honestly there’s no other way to buy clothes except for this app!: I don’t think there’s a reason not to get this app. It’s free and you can filter through things by specifics like brands, categories, and accents. It’s just a good app. Also you can save the sizes that you want and it will pop up the same sizes every time you search. You can save searches I saved forever 21 and I also have just anything that has bows on them saved and I can just click my saved searches and see what I’ve saved. There’s also a heart section that has all the products you’ve liked. There’s just so much to this app and it helps the environment by selling second hand clothes and it will tell you if there is anything wrong with it! You need this app.",5
498,"“Thrift store” ??: I originally downloaded so I could sell some items. After looking into the whole process, I discovered that many people that gave this company their items were getting completely ripped off on the prices. Perfectly good clothes people give this company are sold for as little as 30 cents per item. If you are looking to sell, look elsewhere because you can make MUCH more money on other apps. (Im talking people trying to sell a lot of 20 pieces of clothing to this company and only receiving 5 bucks). 

Anyway, I decided this wasn’t the place to sell. But later on I decided to browse and see if there was anything interesting to buy. This app is marketed as an online “thrift store” so I was expecting reasonably cheap prices. Nope. Honestly, what a waste. If you are going to rip off all of your sellers, the least you could do is make the prices cheap to reflect what’s going on. Smart idea for an app tho y’all must be rich af",1
499,"Kind of a scam: This app is good if you’re shopping, but if you’re planning to clean out don’t bother. It takes forever for the bags to get there, much much longer than the processing and shipping time listed on their websites. I’ve had cleanout kits take upwards of a month and a half to even say they’ve arrived at the facility let alone be processed. One bag I sent in May still says it’s “in transit”. It is now August. 

The payouts you get for items are super low, which would be fine if they’ve accepted several items! Except that in order to cash out, you have to use a third party where thredup takes .25 cents and the third party takes another 1.5%, given how small the payouts are it isn’t even worth it to transfer fifty cents into my account. 

I like using it, and it’s great for finding cheaper clothes in great condition, but as far as selling? Don’t waste your time",3
500,"My experience: I have used thredUP up for about a year an a half. Buying things here is a hit or miss. Sometimes the size charts maybe a bit off. I am a small which ranges from designer to designer. I bought a shirt once that the size was advertised as my measurement, but it was too big. I returned the item( easy to return system) and got my money back. My first package got lost in the mail. Which was my mistake for misspelling the address. Customer service handled it correctly and returned my money. 

An item that was sold, I wanted to find something similar, but Recommendations for finding similar items are a bit off. I think their automatic logarithm are based on color and type. Not style.

Overall, I had great experience with using the app.",5
501,"Love it, great customer service: There is a learning curve ordering used clothing online. When possible I double check brand sizing charts for a better fit, but now that I learned what my size looks like on a ThreadUp model it’s much easier to make sure items fit as desired. I have not had a problem doing returns for returnable items and I was also able to return a non-returnable item because it did not match the description. My only complaint is the “help” emails (for returning a non-returnable item) were sorted into my spam, but that’s on my email, not ThreadUp. If you do think your emails are going unanswered check your spam, because in my experience, it is very unlikely a response was not sent.  I have had great customer service.",5
502,"Used to love it more...: For a while, I was a crazy heavy user and advocate for this site! Loved it! I have a very petite frame, and shopping is very difficult and annoying, so this was a great way to “get things done” while not taking too much time away from my regular day. I even did a few of the sell bags!
But lately, I noticed the $2 restocking fee on everything. That used to be such a perk that it was basically commitment free besides the final sale items, and now you are stuck with paying it per item if it doesn’t fit. Also, you can’t even request a clean out kit anymore for months of lead time. 
I used up my final account credits today from selling my items, and don’t plan on returning to the site after this. The product offering has really grown, but it appears so has the pricing *slightly overall, and business practices have decreased. Sad!",3
503,"Not as good of a deal as it used to be: I started buying things from Threadup about five or six months ago. I really loved it at first and felt like I was getting great deals.

 However, in the past month or two, it seems like things are changing a lot- there is suddenly a tax charge (which I don’t believe was charged before), the minimum for free shipping has gone up by $10, there is now a $1.99 restocking fee when an item is returned and the credit takes a lot longer to show up on your account now. Finally, the prices on the items seem to be increasing. I no longer feel like I’m getting a good deal...

I recently purchased a dress for $20. When it arrived, it still had a tag from Goodwill that said $6 on it. I’ve also “donated” items that were accepted and were posted for more than I paid for them when I purchased new from the store.",3
504,"Love ThredUP and the app!!!: I only made one order so far with the app and absolutely LOVE it!!  I've heard not so good things about the reimbursement on clothes and returns but I don't plan on returning much or sending clothes in.  Buying from them though was easy and fast!  I got clothes for my daughter and they all came in the condition I expected, most like new!  Some have bashed it due to the low reimbursement and time for sending clothes in but I really don't think it's too much different than Once Upon a Child, Style Encore, Platos Closet or even Goodwill (which doesn't reimburse at all and isn't really a charity) so I just think it's a more convenient online version of any of those stores.  I will buy again but I'm on a budget but don't want to go too crazy all at once...and they send you discount codes sometimes!",4
505,"My Favorite Way to Shop Secondhand: I absolutely love thredUP. I’ve been a customer since 2020 and it’s become the place where I get the majority of my clothes. I love the option to set super-specific filters based on my sizes, favorite brands, and the condition of the clothes I’m interested in. It makes it really easy whether I’m looking for a particular item or just browsing for fun. It’s by far my favorite way to shop secondhand and do my small part for the planet. My one small suggestion for improvement would be to have additional photos/angles for some items. Items are mainly photographed from the front and back. If there are any details down the sides, they can be hard to see. Other than that, love it and will continue to be a loyal customer!",4
506,"So upset and disappointed: This WAS my favorite place to shop until now. I was so excited waiting for my clothes to come—I checked to see when they’d arrive and saw that supposedly they’d been delivered last Monday. I live in a secured entry building, and there was no package in the mail room. I checked to see the tracking number and who it was with—the ap is really unclear and says some things may be sent with USPS so I left a note for the mailman with the tracking number. He tells me it’s not a usps tracking number. I don’t know where my package is or who delivered it and there’s no immediate way to contact an actual person through the ap. the package is just gone and I can’t get a refund.",5
507,"Overall I like it: Shipping costs, tracking your orders, and returning items aren’t my favorite things about ThredUp but I’ve found lots of cute items at good prices that I love. Shipping costs seem a bit high especially when my items aren’t trackable once they ship so their arrival date is anyone’s guess. Then if you want to return the item, you have to pay the high shipping cost again so by the time you receive it and want to return it because it doesn’t fit, you end up paying more in shipping than for the actual item. I have several items i bought here that will likely just be donated because shipping them back costs way too much. I’ve found some really great items on here though so I keep coming back.",4
508,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!: I have been a happy Thred Up customer for 2 or 3 years now until this weekend when I had a serious problem with my order and discovered to my shock and horror that there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL WITH THIS COMPANY. You can not get thru to anyone in any way!! On the Customer Chat line they refer you to then send a message thru email, then you can not get an answer to an email either! I even went to other social media sites and sent direct messages! This is Wednesday and I have yet to hear from anyone!!!! There is no phone number to reach them even the technical support number is a dead end! I am so frustrated that I will never place another order with this company. You have been warned!",5
509,"Almost perfect: I’ve had great success shopping online with the ThredUP app. I especially love that they include actual waist measurements for pants, since a size 16 in one brand can be significantly smaller in another. That is what gave me the confidence to order online. The only problem: Under the My Sizes section, the waist measurements only go up to 34, and I am not yet there in my weight loss journey. So instead of easily filtering by waist size, I have to filter by conventional size and then check each item’s listing for the actual waist measurement. It’s doable but a frustrating two step process when just having a wider range of waist measurements available to the My Size filter would make it much more efficient. Other than that, this app is fabulous and I will continue to use it as my primary clothes source.",4
510,"GAMECHANGER: I love thrifting and consigning in stores, so when I came across ThredUP I was super excited.  They truly have such a great selection!  This spring, I’ve had a bit of a change in my fashion sense. It’s been great to have an app that allows me to experiment and get good quality, cute clothes at pretty awesome prices.  For example, I found a bralette that Free People is still selling for $40 on ThredUP for $16. It can take a bit of searching to find the good stuff, but once you do, it becomes really easy to find nice clothes on the app. The only things I cannot speak to are the returning and selling experiences, as I have not tried either of those things. Overall, I think ThredUP is a wonderful app for people looking for beautiful and good quality clothing at great prices.",5
511,"Good for shopping but....: Since I discovered Thredup I am enjoying shopping on there. I found really good items so far but I don't think they have a reasonable prices on everything for selling used clothes. Yes there are items that tag has still attached or in great shape but still expensive. For example like Old Navy products, H&M or even Forever21 products ( or many other ) I know in their stores they go on a sale like prices are so low. I can find those cheaper in their actual stores than the Thredup. Kids clothes are same as well. Just compare before you shop on Thredup even for the High end stuff. You can find those high end brand brand new purses or shoes etc. in Tjmaxx or some other stores cheaper. Just shop smart on thredup.",5
512,"I like the concept: I love scrolling through the clothes and also love the idea of an easy way to buy and sell used clothes. The app saves your sizes and you can build and save advanced searches, which is great. The in-app customer service is fine. I haven’t had any problems with it. The annoying things about the app are: 
1. It’s impossible to tell whether a return has been received 
2. You can’t apply discount codes until the absolute last second of a transaction, so you really can’t tell what your final total will be. For me, this is a huge deal and has consistently prevented me from completing transactions.

In general, I like ThredUP, but it is slooooowwww. Be prepared to wait. I mailed in a return weeks ago and still have no idea what is going on with it. The clean-out kit took over a month to receive. If you are in a hurry, this is not for you.",3
513,"No integrity. Poor customer service.: This app works fine, but I will not be using ThredUP anymore. The first problem I had with them was when I sent in a cleanup bag. I sent a barely used pair of Vans and I got NO credit for them. I don’t know if people are keeping things for themselves or what reason they have for not acknowledging all the items I donated. Know that if you send something in, there’s no guarantee that you will be paid for it. And you’re donating so you can’t get those things back. 

The second problem I’ve now had is when I did a return they didn’t refund me for everything I sent. They claim they are missing items and I sent everything in one box just like they instructed. So I gave them $60 and now have nothing to show for it. I’ve asked them how they’re missing these items and they won’t respond to me.

I will not be using this company again. At least with Poshmark, if the item doesn’t work out for you, you can personally resell it.",1
514,"Fun and easy to use online consignment store!: ThredUp is my favorite place to shop, everything is easy to use, the filters are awesome, and there are so many clothing options for tall girls. With the amount of coupon codes that work with ThredUp, and how many sales occur regularly, you can save so much money (even on designer items). The closet clean out feature is also amazing because it gives you credit hi can use on the website or app!!! ThredUp gives clothes a second life; shopping just became cheaper, guilt free, and more fun!

My critiques include how you cannot save your inseam when looking for pants, as you can many of your other measurements. And there are no sleeve length filters in inches.",5
515,"Waste of time: I submitted a full bag of clothes to ThredUP and it took almost 2 months to process, about 2 weeks over the already long process they quote you. Once I got my total for my full bag of clothes it was a joke. $9 for a clothes plus 2 designer purses. After their fee to use their company I made a total of $4. I looked at how they priced my items and understand a lot of the pricing, they're used items you're not going to get much, but one of the designer purses I gave them they didn't even spell correctly in name so they under priced it (JPK purse they spelled JRK) retail was around $180 for that tote and they had the retail total at $30...selling it for $11. After they give me my total from processing everything, someone from ThredUP contacted me with a generic email asking how my experience was. So I was honest and told them about how I wasn't pleased, that was a week ago and I have yet to get any sort of an email back from them and don't expect I will. ThredUP is a complete ripoff.",1
516,"I have shopped Thred Up for a couple of years: I love this company! I’ve been a regular shopper now for two years at least several times a month. I’ve only ever had one issue that was promptly taken care of by Thred Up customer service. Some boots I ordered were mismarked on the size. The return was simple and they credited my card. I have also sold my own things on the app a few times. The prices vary depending on many factors. You won’t make a fortune unless you are selling designer clothing. But you will make enough credit to take some dollars off your next order. As a regular shopper I’m happy about that. It’s a win win! You get some cute clothing at a deep discount and keep used clothing out of the landfill. Save some money, save the planet.",5
517,"l love thredup, but the app literally destroyed my phone!: I used to frequently shop on the thredup app, until my phone randomly started acting up. The battery would only last 3-4 hours, my phone would get overheated frequently and kept glitching. This was a brand new iphone. Come to find out the thredup app was causing this and destroyed my phones battery health. I tried turning off background app refresh and it didn’t solve anything. 
Their team seriously needs to look into this and fix it because so many others have reviewed the same thing. As soon as a i deleted the app my phone went back to normal, although my battery health is messed up permanently. I will continue to use thredup on the website, but i’m really disappointed this happened and i’m hoping they fix this asap.",3
518,"Great clothing source!: I love ThredUp!  I started using ThredUP to save moolah when I took two years to lose one pound every week or so, and each outfit was only the right size for a few months as I got gradually lighter.  I have only purchased clothes in “Excellent Condition,”  and they look and feel new, are flattering and fun. ThredUP also is really nice about refunds and has friendly helpful customer service.

     After an 85 pound weight loss, my body plateau’d in size 8 months ago, but even though my clothes are no longer changing in size I continued to shop ThredUP for quality and value.  My all time most exciting rare  “find” was a Dianne von Furstenberg purple sun dress in perfect condition for $4 and free shipping!",5
519,"Do not do a clean out!: I wish I could give zero stars. I sent in 2 practically new excellent higher end handbags (only used once. Kate Spade and a coach bag), a beautiful Anne Kline suit and a few cute tops. It took FOREVER to process my clean out kit, and when they processed it, the handbags didn’t even show as received. I have to wonder if someone took them as their own. I was told the bags were not acceptable and had been donated! I could have sold them at my local consignment store for quite a bit of money. The suit and shirts where listed off season and for a fraction of what they were worth. The total projected pay out was less than $10. I ended up getting zero.  When I complained I was told I should have paid $10 for the option to have unwanted items mailed back to me. So basically they wanted me to pay $10 to donate nice items that they MAY return to me. What a joke. I will never do business with them again.",1
520,"Can’t recommend enough.: Seriously. My family is tired of me raving about how much I love this store. I’ve shopped exclusively at ThredUP for almost two years now and I don’t see that changing any time soon! I usually hate shopping because it is SO wasteful and SO expensive, but online thrifting minimizes both of those problems. I got a lovely fall jacket for $4!!! Amazing dresses for under $10! (I swear they’re not paying me to write this review.) The app is great and love how it automatically filters to my sizes. Only thing I would suggest would be improving the search function so I could search, say, “sun dresses” instead of searching through the filtered dress category. But, small complaints— LOVE. Love.",5
521,"Needs an easier way to search: When I first started ordering, the sizes were correct.  Now hardly ever.  Whoever is doing measurements for jeans needs to be fired.  When I choose my size and look at the measurements, it should be correct.  The last 5 pairs of jeans I bought 4 of them were completely wrong.  A 27 inch waist should be 27 inches. Not 12.  I had to give them all to my 5th grade niece and I’m not sure they’ll even fit her.   
If I’m looking for a specific design I’m out of luck unless I know the brand. Example I’m looking for a shirt with a beach scene. Nothing comes up in the search. I will randomly find a beach shirt if I scroll through thousands of shirts but who has time for that? Same with teams. I was looking for a Seahawks shirt. No luck unless I search Nike or Adidas, etc and then scroll through the thousands of results and hope I just happen to find one.",2
522,"Need a lot of work: 1. Return is extremely difficult
2. Always missing critical pictures and descriptions to figure out details. You have to guess for the most part. -> there’s no customer service to answer any of your questions about items. 
3. Sorting is a joke. If you like something, make them your favorite first. Otherwise you will take hours to just go back to it. If you mark them as your favorite, they will be sorted into your ‘likes’ and then you can easily find them. 
4. The best way to navigate: First, search your brand. From there, use filter to sort categories or colors. Then start browsing which usually take a long time. Great killing time app.",5
523,"Horrible Customer Support: To start out, go to your local thrift store, you’re likely to find better items for a lot cheaper. Prices are near retail, the only thing you’re actually saving, you’ll be basically wasting while you are waiting for your items to be delivered. When the app first came out the sales were nearly every week/weekend, and items could be purchased and received in less than a week. Payouts have never been decent, and if you buy box store items and then send them in to be resold, you’re basically donating them. You will not receive payouts on most brands. And to make matters worse, now, you are waiting 2-3 weeks for your purchases to be delivered. Customer service can never give you any idea when you will be receiving your items because it’s like pulling teeth to actually get an answer from anyone to begin with. Don’t waste your time, shop local thrift shops.",1
524,"Disappointed: I’ve always gotten my clothes here and it’s been a mixed bag on the quality of the items but since I’m all for second hand items, I haven’t minded. Beyond that, they really have done a great job updating the app and getting their shipments out in time. One incident which has probably lost their business from me forever is related to their extremely inflexible refund policies. Once you choose a method of refund if you refund an order, they refuse to amend even if you reach out to adjust the method you want to be reimbursed by. The three options for their reimbursement options are confusing and when I accidentally chose free shipping for my return, it made my return to be ineligible for reimbursement to my original form of payment. Customer service was helpful in explaining, but unfortunately is not helpful in regard to helping customers reach a compromise or middle ground for something I needed to be fixed.",1
525,"Saving green by being green: Shopping thrift is already so much better for the planet than buying new, but ThreadUp’s “bundle” shipping for multiple items and amazing discounts on reliably great wardrobe items really makes good choices easy and obvious. I’ve made three large orders since I started shopping ThreadUp about 2 years ago, always love getting my big box of earth-friendly joy! No matter the season, it’s always time to save the world (in a slick new pantsuit!)

I would like to see the additional feature of being able to filter by inseam as well as waist, and to have hip measurements disclosed as well, especially for garments where the hips aren’t “free.” Also, sorting Favorites by different metrics!",5
526,"Please fix my sizes: Thred up is a great app but since the last update “my sizes” are no longer persistent after closing the app. Please fix this!! Every time I open the app I have to re-add my sizes. Also the bug reporting setup is terrible and practically nonexistent. There are links all over the place to report a technical issue but they all lead nowhere. Which is why I resorted to leaving a review.

*Edit: I received a prompt response from the developers that this is being taken care of. Thred up really is a great app when it’s working as intended. I’ve found so many cute clothing items from brands I love for half their original cost. Scrolling through the app trying to find something cute can be a very relaxing and rewarding experience.",5
527,"Great selection: I’ve committed to only buying second hand and haven’t purchased a single new piece of clothing in 2020, but I have the cutest wardrobe now thanks to ThredUP. It takes some shopping and sorting but I gave been able to find great quality, even new, pieces that fit perfectly. All under my budget of $25 per piece. The only thing I wish is for better photos and descriptions. Yes, it’s fun getting surprised when something is even better than anticipated, but kind of a pain having to return or sell something that is just not as pictured. Photos of the inside of the article would be nice.
The bundle and save option is a great option so you don’t risk losing a favorite item if you want to save on shipping. 

I have not tried selling anything so I can’t say how that service is.",4
528,I absolutely LOVE ThredUP and Buying or Selling/donating: I have bought four times now from ThredUP and the first three times went very smooth.  I just made the fourth order so I’m excited to see my items and ty them on.  I love the variety that I don’t see at other stores especially since I live in a smaller town.  I am probably going to order a kit to send in items since I like the fact they donate items they don’t accept and you can decide to donate it all if you want. If you want top dollar for your items then you’ll have to sell them yourself but it’s a great way to clean out your closet. It’s hard selling clothes so it’s definitely a better option than even Goodwill since they don’t specifically donate their items.,5
529,"Need More Information: I love ThredUP. I’ve been using it for years, however, my biggest complaint is the way pieces are advertised. I’ve ordered something on three separate occasions where I received an item that had a detail that would have kept me from buying it. Examples: I bought a pair of brown slacks, when I got them they had a black stripe all the way down the side, this was NOT in the description. I also bought a black and white striped shirt, the sleeves had pearls all down them, again not advertised. I just got a dress today, but it’s a wrap dress (I have a wide rib cage so I don’t care for those) and it was not in the description. 
Again, I just wish they would describe the pieces in more detail. Even when it comes to purses. There are two pictures... I’d be more inclined to order something if I saw or read more about what I was interested in.",3
530,"Love it for the most part: I absolutely love this app EXCEPT for the shipping. It literally is a hit and miss. A lot of my packages lately, within the last two months, have been taking an entire month to get to me. One had been lost. ThredUP did reimburse me for it but the disappointment is not being able to get another shipped out to me. I was so excited to get to wear that blazer but never did. 

They ship through FedEx and I think we should have an option for expedited shipping or an alternative shipper through USPS/ UPS. Anything. When the packages do arrive, the clothes are amazing. A few of them say ‘like new’ but I have received some with small holes in them. I wouldn’t suggest selling through them. I have sent in some brand new clothes with tags just for them to not list them. I would like the option to have them shipped back to me at my expense.",3
531,"Budget and Earth Friendly: I’ve made several purchases for myself and my mom on this app and have been so satisfied. I always check the “new or like new” and everything has arrived as if brand new. There’s great deals/sales and the size/fit descriptions have helped make sure the items will fit. The packaging is cute and the shipping is quick. 

I plan to sell items in the future, but for now as a buyer, I’ve been completely satisfied with my experience. When a package was lost in the mail, I was fully reimbursed, so I’ve continued to shop here. Feels better knowing it’s not contributing to fast fashion, and that someone out there is benefitting from my purchase. 

Highly recommend, it’s been such a great resource for me.",5
532,"Suggestions: I love the fact we are recycling and taking away products and chemicals that hurt our environment. But I think it would be good if you let your customers use two perks at once. For instance you give us free shipping, but then we can’t use the discount. Or you give us $10 credit, but then we can’t use the discount or we have to pay the shipping. You would move more product if you were a little bit more generous with your customers, especially the Vits. They are your customers who order the most volume.  They need better rewards than they have so far.
And PS: why have you upped the shipping,, and why did VIT customers  now have to spend $39 instead of $29 to get free shipping.

I thought the companies’  objective is to save the environment , which is commendable. But if that is your real goal, make it more enticing to your customers.
And I forgot to mention $899 or $1099 shipping? That’s excessive, plus you added two dollars to returns.
In an era of free shipping and free returns you are kind of missing the boat. After all you are dealing with secondhand clothes.
Provide incentives for those people who are willing to shop secondhand.",4
533,"Love Concept - App & Photos Need Work: Love second-hand scores and upsetting the environmentally damaging impact of ready-to-wear fashion but this apps search and sorting functions need work. It’s also difficult to take a chance on trying items due to the return and restocking fees. One really has to know what they are looking for, the fabrics or brands they trust and then also know all their sizing measurements in said brand to score. I’ll keep shopping here and again, love the idea, but it can be a hard sale because sometimes it is a literal needle-in-a-haystack mission in terms of shopping. I think making more details available could help with search narrowing and defining and when items are dark colors it is sometimes hard to see details in the photos. All in all tho I’ll totally keep using",3
534,"Almost great: I really like this shop. It has a variety of items and I love how they always a good sale going or perks to get free shipping. I also like how they have quality name brands for really reasonable prices. My only problem with ThredUP is the filters. The filters are not vet effective, especially in finding clothes that are best suited for juniors. It is so hard to find what I want without having to sor through hundreds of outfits that are not my style. When I do find things I like they are rally nice. But it takes so long to find a decent amount of favorites. For this reason I am not able to buy multiple items I love. I would much appreciate if they improved the filters for finding clothes and also made it easier to find similar items after tapping to view one item.",3
535,"They used to be great but things have changed: I only order items listed as “minor wear if any, you might mistake or brand new” but lately several items in each order have had holes, excessive wear and many are covered in a black greasy substance that does not come out. There seems to be something in their packing facility that is getting all over the clothes because it has happened with several orders, and is getting worse with each shipment. Also most items are marked as final sale so you have to spend hours on hold with customer support to have someone override this, on the MANY items that arrive with stains, pilling, snags, etc. when the items were listed as “ like new”. It just feels like quality control has gone out the window as they have grown.",3
536,"Crappy experience: I wouldn’t recommend this app I’d suggest Poshmark for selling your things you have full control and make more money off your things I also had a bad experience I sent two bags full of clothes took about a month and they were only showing one bag of stuff I mailed on my account that they had posted for sale I waited for my second bag to be received and posted it’s now been about 6 months and still hasn’t shown up I also ordered another bag to fill shortly after the first one got received and never got that in the mail either and another issue I sent good name brand products such as MK, Victoria’s Secret,Nike, etc. And out of the 17 nice products in the one bag that they were showing as received I got paid $6 it’s honestly a waste of time and effort on my opinion I used more than that $6 in gas driving to and from the post office to Mail the bags would give negative stars if I could",1
537,"sellers beware!!: I sent clothes over to be sold as I needed to get rid of my old clothes. It took weeks to get processed, and when it finally was they immediately put some of the items up for sale. I had sent all good condition things, no tears, stains, markings, or anything! Yet, only about five of my items were actually put up. Then, the items that were up for sale only had 30 or so days until they would be taken down. The items that did sell (tags and all) I only received a tiny portion of the sale. I don’t remember exact numbers however it was in the single digits (think 7$) for a 40$ sale!! and I couldn’t even get the money out, it was in my threadUP account to be used on the app/site. I’m only a teen trying to make some money & this was a horrible way to do it. Never again! (Yes I’m aware I sound like a  Karen, but I’m upset! I would’ve made a lot more money selling ice water on a hot summer day!)",1
538,"Love that it’s second hand: I like that it is second hand and the prices for a lot of the clothes are reasonable. What I don’t like is if your clothes don’t fit you not only have to pay $1.99 per item as a restocking fee and unless you do a store credit you have to pay for shipping on your returns and sadly they won’t let you return them all in the same bag. So if you’re unlucky enough to have two or more bags you lose out on $10 per bag plus the restocking fee. So, more than likely you’ll do a store credit and it’s for less than you spent. So now I’m really cautious about buying because of the returns and they sometimes photograph the clothes to look different than they actually are and I’ve lost money due to that.",4
539,"Beware of incorrect sizing, measurements, and categories: UPDATE: I’ve purchased 13 items and 6 of these items had the wrong sizes listed, when the size was clearly marked on the tag 🤬 THATS ALMOST HALF. I’m done with this company. 

In all I’ve purchased 11 items from ThredUP. 4 of these items arrived and were completely different sizes than what was advertised and the measurements were WAY off. Also, there’s a specific brand that I like, and was excited to find them through ThredUP at first, but as I started exploring the brand and different categories like “dresses” or “tops” I found that they were all mixed up. Some shirts are labeled as dresses and some dresses labeled as shirts, but not all the time. It’s like they hired 8 yr olds to measure, describe, and categorize this stuff. It’s all wrong and there’s no conformity. The prices are pretty unreasonable also, they’re  getting this stuff for pennies and saying they’re like new when they’re definitely not. RIP OFF!!!! Also, returns aren’t free.",1
540,"Changes: This company was wonderful in the beginning. Great customer service, fair prices, honest staff. Unfortunately the company has lost its way among the rest of the corporations. What was once a beneficial service for everyone is now price gouging, providing poor customer service and several times outright thievery by staff receiving thred-up bags. How do new coach sandals magically disappear? A credit after multiple complaints through the app only to learn the app isn’t “monitored”?! You can do better!

After this review was submitted, thred-up no longer acknowledges this problem. As an older adult I believe this is symptomatic to the larger problem of the lack of responsibility. The credo appears to be “if you cannot fix the problem, fix the blame”.",5
541,"Like new is sometimes quite used: I love Thredup for the concept and some of the deals I’ve gotten on brands I’d never look at or enjoy at actual sticker prices.
What I don’t understand is the reluctance of the co to label some clothes as ‘worn’ or ‘gently worn’ rather than ‘like new’. I don’t want to bother with a sweater that’s been long loved and is well worn. None of this would be a big deal if it were not for the restocking fee. I support it for things that arrive as advertised but I am disgruntled by things that arrive looking quite used and require for me to pay a restocking fee because of misrepresentation. The co is large enough and successful that it can be conservative about which items to describe as “like new.” You can do better ThredUP. Do better.",5
542,"Sold a few, bought a lot: I’ve been using ThredUP for quite some time now and love looking on the app while relaxing on the couch. Twice now, I have bought my Mother’s dresses on ThredUP. I could afford a better quality dress and knew it would have to be altered anyway. I’ve also purchased used children’s clothing. Why pay full price for clothes the child grows out of in a few months? Better than wasting time at garage sales and thrift stores! You save on gas, exposure to viruses, and your helping the eco-system by re-using!

Two suggestions: process the returns faster and get more accuracy on types of material and detailed descriptions. It might take longer but you’d reduce returns.",5
543,"Customer service is HORRIBLE!: They sent part of my order to another person! Thankfully the recipient was nice enough to email me and let me know or else I would be left wondering where my stuff was. I messaged customer support multiple times and have yet to hear back... 9 days later!!! Customer service is completely worthless so far and it’s completely unacceptable for a company to not respond, especially when they were the ones to mess up.

Edit: they responded after 11 days. They said the package was shipped without a label and USPS should have delivered it and they filed a complaint with them! They didn’t even bother to read what I initially wrote or else they would know it wasn’t USPS’s fault. I did get a refund for the items lost and had to pay the recipient of my item to ship them to me. They closed out the conversation before I could tell them that USPS was not at fault or to request for them to pay my extra shipping. Horrible customer service!",1
544,"I love ThredUp, except for…: Finally using ThredUp has been a revelation! I am actually loving thrift shopping for the first time. As a plus size person, thrift shopping is so frustrating as it’s really difficult to find your sizing. This makes searching designer and luxury clothes in my size not only possible, but also enjoyable. My only issue is that I’m consistently shown two sizes smaller than what I wear. I’ve triple checked the filter and insured that my correct sizes are in my profile. It’s always frustrating and disappointing to see a beautiful item that you then realize you’ll never fit into. I’ve emailed ThredUp about this and I’m hoping for a fix soon. That’s when my four star review will change to an absolute five star.",4
545,"Revolutionary: There are two things I talk to people about constantly: shelter animals and ThredUp. ThredUp created the revolution that, as soon as everyone catches on, will forever change how we buy clothes. I’ve always shopped at secondhand stores but decades ago I was looking for a bargain instead of considering the impact I had buying new textiles versus giving old clothes another life. Who knew? Now, we all should. I love this company so much I’m now an investor. And honestly, if I didn’t work in conservation and have limited fashion sense, I’d probably try to work for them. Do yourself a favor and get on the ThredUP train. We have a climate apocalypse to fight and dang it, we’re all going to look fabulous doing it.",5
546,"Thank Goodness for ThredUP!!: As an older woman who has worked her entire life in an office while raising two children, most of my disposable income was directed towards that effort.  Now that my children are grown, I am able to build my wardrobe with the upscale brands I have always loved, but could not afford.  Thanks to ThredUP I am now able to dress very stylishly without breaking the bank.  I have never enjoyed shopping at brick and mortar shops, so being able to shop online works very well for me.  The return process is easy, and I’ve been able to clean out my old clothing using their Clean Out bags.  I’ve scored many rewards because of my shopping and have used these rewards towards free shipping or further discounts.  A total win-win!",5
547,"Annoyingly difficult to return items: My first order from ThredUp was a casual dress. Since I ordered online, I obviously could not try it on until it arrived. I did not like the way the dress looked on me, so I decided to return it. The return option was not even showing up on the app or the site for 2 days of searching for it (Customer service still has not gotten back to me). When the return option finally appeared on the 3rd or 4th day, the option to print a free label was not working. There was some random error, so I had to choose “print my own label.” This means I have to physically go into the post office and pay for whatever shipping costs, because I have to somehow make my own label (obviously without a barcode). My refund will basically be eaten just by shipping it back (plus a restock fee). I will not use this company again.",2
548,"I love this app!!: So I’ve been using Thredup for a few weeks and it’s one of my favorite apps to shop on. I love buying expensive clothes for cheap!

However, I gave this app a 4 star review because there is one thing I would change. So I have ordered a few things and while they’re great, I find that the photos that are taken and descriptions lack important details. I bought a cardigan that looked like it would be plain black and when I got it in the mail, it was very sparkly. Luckily I don’t mind this and I’m still going to happily wear it, but I told my roommate about this and she said she wouldn’t be happy about that. 

Here’s the thing: I have read that Thredup is understaffed and I’m sure it takes a whole team of people to organize the clothes and take photos every single day. The photos are high quality, but they don’t seem to capture the details that are important for buyers to see. May I suggest taking one detail shot (if needed) or more of a description? That way there will be enough info so buyers can get an accurate assessment of what they want to buy.

Other than that, I do love this app and I know I’m going to use it a lot!",4
549,"Still waiting!: I ordered from this site in 2018 and had no problems . Placed an order November 2020 and even though I checked the address same as billing & had updated my new address on account order was still sent to address from 2 years ago. I contacted thred up before they shipped that it had used my old address. They said sorry if it’s returned we will reship it to the correct address. So I called my post office ( I moved 3 blocks over), contacted the current residents and it was safe I would get it either way. After the tracking updated ( they use a ups mail innovations system that doesn’t update til after) I called my post office they had said they would hold them for me, but thred up had labeled them undeliverable because I left no forwarding address & they were once again sent back. So they made it all the way to my post office, and now dec I’m still waiting for a refund or return or something. Worst customer service ever!! BUYER BEWARE!",1
550,"Shopping for clothes can actually be fun?: This coming from a reclusive paleobotanist who never cared much for the price tags and rushed experience at malls, ThredUP has introduced me to a new world of fun and beautiful consumerism which has quite happily consumed a generous fraction of my time at conservative fraction of my money!  It’s so easy to find some of the prettiest and unique items at extremely affordable costs, and in excellent condition!  Everything is fresh, with new items coming in all the time (leaving juuuust enough of that thrilling time pressure to make the buying fun).  I’ve received so many compliments for the clothes I’ve bought from here!  I never understood why all the ladies around me cared about clothes shopping until now.  Thank you, ThredUP!!!",5
551,"Obsessed: When you have that “eye” you can really find some exceptional pieces on this app! I love that this site is always offering amazing discount codes, and the perks of continuing to shop while having items in your cart for up to three hours before purchasing. If I receive an item that I am not too fond of, I always choose to return my item and receive store credit, because there is always an item on ThredUP to purchase! I am all about building a sustainable wardrobe with timeless pieces and I am so happy that this platform allows me to do so. With time, patience and of course the “eye” you can definitely find exceptional pieces for a ridiculous affordable price! :)",5
552,"Loving the huge selection!: I live in a rural community and have beer budget and caviar dreams! The selection at the second hand and consignment shops here have very limited selection. I am super picky about fabrics and appreciate that I can look at materials and measurements. I have a beautiful wardrobe and was able to send clothes I was holding onto off to sell. When I need something new, I will check here first. I’ve had one problem. I sent in pictures because the item was out of the return window but I had only worn once. I had a customer service person respond in 3 days. Just received 2 very personable emails and the defective item was promptly refunded! Highly recommended!",5
553,"LOVE this app: ThredUP is one of my favorite apps to shop on. I could spend hours upon hours browsing. And I love the Goody Boxes feature! I do have a couple suggestions that I think would make the app better. I think when you click on an item to see the details there should be a more in depth description of the item and also a ""Shop Similar"" option on the item's page. I also think the free shipping threshold should be lowered to $50 as not everyone wants or can afford to spend $79, which is why we are shopping secondhand in the first place! Other than that, I think the app is great and it's definitely one of my go to's when I am looking to buy clothes.",5
554,"Consignment Convenience: Love this app because it offers me a convenient way to go consignment shopping.  Not able to give it 5 stars due to it not registering when I remove an item from my favorites until I completely close out the app. Also, I have to press the ""-"" button again after I attempt to delete an item from my cart. Besides all that, I still enjoy app.

Follow up- Still love the app even though I still have the same problems mentioned above. Also, for some reason unlike all my other apps, it’s app icon is now having trouble registering on my app page unless it's in the bottom task bar. ThredUP is still a great place to get secondhand items.",5
555,No exude: I ordered one of their clean out bags and I got it and I sent them a cream colored coach purse with gold trim and a double zipper wallet off-white also coach funny enough that I actually purchased from them but I sent it back to sell  they got it July 8 it’s still has not been put on the website it says that they didn’t get it until September 24 but even still we’re talking almost 2 months and it still is not on the website I have repeatedly sent emails try to do the live chat there’s no number to call or actually I take that back there is a number to call but it’s only for like a technical support situation I have actually reached a point where I’m about to contact the Better Business Bureau and maybe even action news on your side this is ridiculous this is theft. I have requested several times that my items be returned to me and still no response. I am so frustrated and angry because I really loved buying stuff from threat up.,1
556,"Love this site: I love thredUP. I’ve used it for several years and believe in second hand shopping. Some prices are a little to high, but I understand it’s part of an algorithm. Sometimes it is worth spending a little more knowing you are helping the environment. Nevertheless, I’ve had a lot of great deals and I can proudly say that 90% of my closet is second hand (I also shop at thrift and consignment stores). I get told all the time I should be an ambassador because I’ve gotten so many friends to use the site. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because with the last couple updates the home page does not load for me. I keep getting an error and it’s been very frustrating. My phone and app are completely up-to-date, so can someone look into this please?",4
557,"The BEST clothes!: I’m definitely NOT a huge online shopper, but ThredUP is AMAZING! I’ve bought more from TU then on ANY other online website:) The prices are beyond reasonable and everything that I’ve ordered so far is hands down accurate as far as the way it’s described! I’m an educator and definitely DON’T have the financial freedom to buy pricey high end clothes, but with ThredUP, I’ve found BEAUTIFUL clothes at prices I can afford! ThredUp, you’ve got one loyal customer!😊 And the other really nice thing aside from they’re more than reasonable prices is...things go on sale with price drops and special codes for even LOWER prices!🤭😁 And I also LOVE that they always include the polka dot bag so you can do a clean out to give things to them!😊 Thank you ThredUP!",5
558,"Buyer Beware!: This company has terrible customer service. It is essentially non-existent! They say they will answer emails within 7-8days. I have never heard of a BtoC business being able to successfully run like this! Furthermore I question the honesty of this company. Aside from the fact that you have to pay a re-stocking & shipping fee for your returned items, it seems that they may decide not to give your money back at all! I returned 10items of clothing (worth over $200), and was just notified by PayPal that I received a total of $3 for my returned items. Being unable to get a hold of anyone in their customer service department (either through chat or email), I am left to assume my money has been stolen. I am considering taking legal action if this issue continues to be unresolved.",4
559,"Used to be good - now it’s not worth it!: ThredUP used me be good for selling secondhand but now the costs have outweighed the benefits. They are now charging you to list your items on top of them already taking a majority cost of the sale. I will no longer be using this platform, but if you do, I highly recommend you take pictures of everything you send in (and wish for the best) - they have lost/misplaced items on more than one occasion. If you push hard enough, they’ll rectify the situation but you’ll have to fight/bug them consistently for months (which may not be worth it).
With this new fee, it seems they’ll may be trying to transition into a higher tier reseller like TheRealReal, hoping they’ll receive higher value items. Really bummed about this - I’ve been sending so much stuff in for the last 5 years. 😞😞",2
560,"I love Thred Up!: I enjoy going to thrift stores and finding that one of a kind item or anything vintage. 
When I came across the Thread Up app I couldn’t wait to download it and see what it was about. Holy Cow! I could not believe how many items there were to choose from. It’s endless. Filters make it easy to find what your looking for though from sizes, color, length, brand including designer, and items with tags still on them, items slightly used or in between. 
I just got a really cute pair of sandals for summer and paid next to nothing for them. When they arrived they were exactly as pictured and described.
I just love it! You can also clean out your closet and send things to sell as well. It’s a win win!",5
561,"Great with Sales: I am loving ThreadUp. It’s fun and you can find some great buys.  BUT you really have to wait for sales.  Otherwise you are paying too much for used clothing.  Yes it’s much less than new prices, but these are not new clothes.  ALSO the pictures don’t alway allow you to notice details about the items.  I was very surprised with the look of some of my items.  Not at all how they appeared in the picture.  Black items don’t show details at all. Look carefully at the description of the item.  The “good with some signs of wear” is much more used than I had expected from the pictures.  They aren’t at all worth the price unless you get a great sale. I’d definitely stick with the “excellent” or “new with tags” condition.",4
562,"Better search features needed: I wish there were ways to search a little more specifically for clothing sizes like petite. You can “include petites” but I can’t just look at everything they have that available that’s petite. Additionally I can’t search through dresses by sleeve length, which is huge. Clothing descriptions need to become a little more specific too. I have ordered things only to be super surprised at a detail on the side not visible in just front/back pictures. And I have concerns about the provided measurements being accurate. I have compared identical pieces (same dress in same size) but the measurements for the chest were different. I also wish that they used the data from already favorited clothes to suggest pieces you might like. Better yet, a Stich Fix kind of thing with a selection of clothes sent to me.",3
563,"Love the clothes, app could use work: Great clothes, and I love to buy secondhand, so I keep coming back. But there are at least two improvements they need on the app, and I don’t see any place to give feedback directly (so, I guess that’s a third improvement!). First, some items are clearly labelled incorrectly, like it’s a little boy’s size 6 shirt and it’s categorized as a women’s size 6. Wouldn’t it be helpful if users could flag something like that?? Second, it’s great to be able to save my favorites, but I also want to be able to filter my favorites—I have hundreds, and I’d like to be able to look at, say, just the skirts that I’ve favorited. Otherwise it still takes forever to find what I’m looking for, compare items, etc.",4
564,"AMAZING!!!: OMG!!! thredUP is awesome!!
Last year I had weight loss surgery, so I have been flying through sizes & clothes!  I had some nicer clothes that were in good condition, so I decided to try thredUP. I ordered two bags; 1 for donation & 1 to sell.  It was sooo easy! The bags arrived, I filled them & sent them back.  It was that easy! My clothes sold & I had some money in my account. I decided to go shopping!  So much fun sorting, filtering & choosing favorites.  I placed my order & waited..... My “new to me” clothes arrived this week!  It was like they arrived from a boutique!!! Beautifully packaged and wrapped!! I was so excited!  Every item fit well & was exactly as described!  I am so happy!!  The whole process is simple and fun!  
ThredUP is my new addiction!  
I thoroughly recommend it!!",5
565,"Bring back consistent measurements!: I used to love ThredUP, but now they’ve taken away the one thing that made shopping with them so easy and positive: measurements. It used to be that the majority of clothes had measurements, which meant I was always pretty certain it would fit. I have gotten at least a dozen items and only returned one or two because of fit. Out of hundreds of items I looked at recently, only a couple pairs of pants had measurements. Everything else I had to look up the brand and find their sizing charts. Even so, that isn’t always reliable. Shopping for second-hand clothes is often time-consuming and frustrating. I range from a small to large and 2-6, which makes online shopping scary. Because let's face it, women's sizing is messed up. ThredUP used to be a relief from all that... now it’s just as much a guessing game as shopping online anywhere else.",2
566,"Started out great then like every other business went down hill for me: I have been a customer for about 4 months now I loved thread up when I first started using it free returns great price point and great customer service but now they charge for returns and price went up $5 or more on each item clothing is not something I buy online ever especially used they shrink,fade,damage,fabric type but I could do that risk free not any more I like to save money that’s why I use this site that’s the type of people that will use this site your getting away from your customer with the prices I will just go to my local new to you retailer or buy new I bought more when I had great prices and free returns now I’m very cautious about what I buy I over think it and end up purchasing nothing and the rest of your customers will do the same",3
567,Second hand made easy but needs tweaks: Hi I’ve bought from thred up a few times and usually I’m pretty satisfied. I wish the measurements were a little more accurate but it’s fine enough. My problem is that the heart button to save an item is where I ALWAYS tap to view the item. If I’m in my saved clothes and I accidentally tap the heart it’s so difficult to find that specific item again because it removes the item I wanted to view. I recommend moving the heart button to the upper right part of the preview image or swapping the cart button with the heart button. I’ve lost so many items I would’ve bought otherwise:/ overall though I really enjoy thred up and will continue to buy,4
568,"Literally the worst customer experience I’ve ever had: Wow. I used to absolutely love this company and was a big advocate. I’ve now been totally burned. I found out that they were only partially refunding orders (and sometimes not at all) and would only begrudgingly refund the right amount after a long email exchange. I also sent in two clean out kits a year and a half ago that are still “processing” seriously don’t send these in if you ever want to see payment or your clothes again. The customer service reps told me that this was the normal processing time?? So either they’re lying or the service is absolutely terrible. Seriously have never felt so wronged by a company. Now finally I have most of the return money back but even though they told me they would refund it to my original form of payment, it showed up as store credit. So unbelievable. Seriously watch out, this company is shady.",1
569,"Mixed Feelings: I notice that only positive comment are responded to. Ironic. I have purchased ALOT of items on ThreadUp. Because returning is not easy, I’ve also donated ALOT of the items I’ve purchased. Some items are not worth the amount they are charging. I also feel that the payout on items I’ve sent in to sell is extremely low. They make a lot of money off the items they sell considering they payout so little. I find that many sizes are also wrong. 
I have purchased a lot of very nice things, as well. I watch the site daily so I’m pretty familiar with their inventory in my size. I am being a little more cautious when purchasing now. You really need to check & double check before buying. Customer service rots.",4
570,"Good for the Environment and Your Wallet: I’ve been using ThredUP for around 2 years now and it’s become the sole place I buy clothing from. You can find a great selection if you put a little time into searching and save big on items that might otherwise be out of your price range.

It’s a thrill to hunt for hidden gems and I’ve gotten many compliments on the pieces I’ve picked out. I enjoy it so much that I’ve even been a personal shopper for my friends on the site/app. 

Their Buy & Bundle feature is great as it allows you to have more time to shop and find items to get you to the free delivery point. It is also good for when they have multi-day sales so that you don’t have to spend a shipping fee every day.",5
571,"Why Isn’t Everyone Doing This??: ThredUP is the real deal, and it’s become my newest obsession! Real talk, I can’t stop sending them my clothes. I love that, unlike your traditional “sell your stuff” apps (Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, EBay, etc.), you don’t have to store your own inventory, take photos, or if you’re a seller, interact with any potential buyers (where my introverts at). ThredUP does it all for you on their super professional platform, and you just get paid when something sells. Period. Oh, and did I mention you can set (and adjust) your selling price points any time?Also, there is no fear of getting scammed, whether you’re buying or selling. Everything is verified by their team of experts. I mean...it doesn’t get easier than this!",5
572,"Really nice site: I started a work where I had to be more of business casual kind of thing and not just jeans and t-shirt as I used to. So really have this site a try to explore what kind of style would I like without over expense on trial and errors. I have placed a few orders, have returned clothes that didn’t like or didn’t fit with no hassle. It is much easier to have the returns as credit and is, for me, more like a budget dedicated for the purpose, but I can see some people not being happy for having to pay a commission to have a refund to credit card. The clothes are as described. I tend to search for new with tags and they are in perfect condition. I have even try this with my daughter and they have really good quality at a very reasonable price. I am loving it.",4
573,"Would never recommend: I heard about thredUP through an Instagram influencer. Eager to finally make money off of clothes I’ve been trying to get rid of forever (they were out of season, but newer) I downloaded the app and gave it a go. It took almost a month for the bag to be mailed to me, I then mailed it back within a few days because I just ready to get it over with. I sent the bag back the 22 of February, and the items weren’t finished processed until the 3 of April. Keep in mind, I started all this back in January. I was glad the bag was so big, and it fit the large amount of clothes I was getting rid of. To my surprise, the most I would be making off of all that wasted time is less than $3. I was hoping for Atleast $10, especially seeing that most of my chosen items to be resold are priced higher than that. Extremely disappointing and I would never recommend this method. Good idea but needs leaps and bounds on improvements.",1
574,"Horrible Service and Delivery Experience!: Don’t order something without having a backup because it may take close to a month to receive!!—IF EVER!! I am still waiting for an order that shipped at the beginning of November and sent FedEx. The history shows this package being bounced around between three states every 3 days....in my city every 3rd day and still not delivered! Thred Up customer service did nothing to assist with locating and fixing the delivery issue! They never made one call to FedEx to assist!  The contents cost me approximately $140, so not just an inconsequential thing! Had to keep educating five different CSRs on the history of the package and still no assistance! Terrible service and lack of professional integrity!",5
575,"Love It!: I love using thred up since it gives me a variety of options to choose from and a wide range of styles. It’s super cheap and the team they have working is super sweet. I have had to few problems (with my own personal errors) and the lady I talked to was super helpful and not rude at all. The only thing I dislike is what you get is sometimes a hit or miss. It says good condition, and it may come back to be “meh”. But then again, sometimes it’s better to look a little more close at what your want to purchase. And if not, most of the time you can’t return it. I would recommend this site to anyone, and save your money on top of reducing clothing waste! ♻️❤️",5
576,"Terrible app! Used to love it, but not anymore!: I have used ThredUP for about 1-2 years. I have sent 2 bags and got a pay out for only 1. Although the second one had Jcrew items, which they advertise as items they would like to get. When sending them items, they advertise them on the app as a whole different color and style. Not to mention just like everyone says bellow, they give you NOTHING back for it or maybe just $3. Since this happened, I have been giving my designer clothes to a local consignment store. Then, the settings to mark for the brands you are looking for, doesn’t work at all!! It makes things worse. When looking for brands like, The Odells, Young fabulous and Broke, or other brands, it doesn’t show you all of them. If there’s s style/brand you are looking for, you have to look in the entire pool. It doesn’t matter if you used the filters for the conditions, brand, etc. Super unreliable. 

I’m super disappointed.",1
577,"I truly want to love Thred Up: I have made maybe a handful of purchases from them over the last several years. When I first started buying from them the items I received were true to what they were advertised as. The last few orders more recently have been filled with items that are not advertised truthfully or completely, and the ‘like new’ condition category no longer means it’s in good shape. It could mean that it has holes, pulls or have been visibly washed to death. It would seem that they possibly got to the level of popularity where they don’t really care as much about accuracy and honesty. The return policy is also completely ridiculous. So many items they won’t let you return even if they are the ones who lied about the item. I really do love the idea of Thred up, so all of these things make me sad.",2
578,"Not the bargain it seems: Well, they try to give the measurements on the clothes, but the measurements are never right. So you will receive clothing that is too big or too small. And their return policy is ridiculous. It has a ridiculously short return window and if you want to get money back, you have to pay for your own return shipping at a ridiculous rate. Plus I have received clothing that is not only wrinkled, but has stains, bad odors, and holes They do nothing to clean the clothes. There is no quality control. They just get the clothes straight from other people and then send them straight to you. Gross.

 I understand most thrift stores work this way, but at least in person if something is badly stained or smells, you can avoid buying it. That’s not the case here where stains and holes go unseen even with the zoom in feature. Never purchasing from here again. Not worth it.",1
579,"Unreliable company-do not purchase: I purchased a few items that I needed to have for an important trip where I am leaving Tuesday. These items were purchased in plenty of time and guess what? Late Sunday night and FedEx says a label has been created but the items haven’t been shipped. 
Not only would anyone not assist in canceling this order since I WON’T BE HERE TO ACCEPT IT FOR A WEEK but I had to go out and buy replacements for these items that were promised to have been delivered.
Here’s the kicker: if you need help placing an order? They will be there in a minute to help you! 
If they’ve already received your money-I was on hold for over 20min with absolutely no one helping so I ended the chat (since they don’t provide a number for this either.)
Just stay away from this company. They take your money and then go silent on you. Less than a star, really. Thanks for screwing me over👏🏻",1
580,Love Thread Up! Thanks to my Auntie Pam!: My Auntie Pam(Pamela Gates ) currently uses this company and loves it . She told me about this company and how it works now I am becoming a huge fan. I am currently waiting to see how my items I sent in will sell. I also have been finding lots of Great items for myself . My first order was a cocktail dress and it was beautiful when it arrived  and the fit was great! I have not been disappointed with anything at all or this this company . I would never have tried this if it was not for my Auntie who already has been using this for awhile and had great success!  I just love that it has name brands also and can help you search your size !,5
581,"Good idea, bad execution: The app has basically stopped working, even though I do all the updates and have installed/uninstalled multiple times. My experience is that the listings frequently have inaccurate condition and sizing info. Always verify pricing with other sites because they have an inflated idea of what some stuff is worth. I’ve  found better pricing on places like Nordstrom Rack multiple times (ThredUP doesn’t price match!). Ordered a Goody box, and the three things I liked I was able to buy at other retailers for less than half the ThredUP price. And I don’t get why, if they bother to photograph the clothing in the first place, they don’t take closeups of the fabric and tag. They really should switch to models (and list the height, weight, measurements of the model), because then folks would have a way, way better idea of the real fit.",2
582,"Use to shop here until I started to sell here: I used to shop on this app all the time, but I tried selling one time I sent in three of their closet clean out bags completely full of everything from shoes handbags nice dresses lots of brand new kids clothes with tags still on it. The problem became that after the $15 shipping and handling fee they still wouldn’t give me my money that I was rightfully owed, many times to contact her customer service and after 15 minutes of waiting, you tend to get a little annoyed and give up but regardless, you can’t get a response out of them other than it’s the fees the fees are already covered so now what how come you haven’t given me my payout they have returned because they’re helping the planet and you ain’t gonna get the money for them and you’re not gonna get them back either. Do yourself a favor if you’re selling and sell locally",1
583,"Like it, Love it, Have suggestions: Absolutely love shopping on ThredUP. The search functions are fantastic - having searches show up already sorted by my sizes and with so many other options to filter makes finding what I need so easy. 
I love that my shopping on ThredUP has a more positive impact on the environment- win-win!
So here are my suggestions for improvement: better pictures and identification of the metal color on accessories (esp belts). While descriptions are generally spot-on, a little more visible detail in the pictures would help a TON! And I don’t do gold, and wish like heck the belt listings said what metallic color the buckles are - especially when shopping on my phone it can be so hard to tell/impossible.",4
584,"This place is phenomenal: I live in a place where size 2 is hard to impossible to find. I go to the stores only to come home frustrated and empty handed. Now I can shop from home from the expense variety the place offers. I’ve purchased great quality clothes for a very reasonable price. I’m doing most of
my purchasing here. The pictures and detailed description are fantastic. Returning is a breeze. I get lots of compliments for the clothes I’ve purchased here. I tell all my friends about it. Some people frown at the mention of used clothes. I answer by saying if they can sleep in hotel sheets and dry themselves with hotel towels (ew), they can certainly wear used clothes.",5
585,"Buying excellent - Selling Beware: Love to buy from here, but have to say I’ve received items that were nothing like the measurements listed and items that were supposed to be black that were actually navy blue.

Selling through them is awful and that’s being nice. I sent a massive cleanout bag in that were all high-end name brand and little to none were listed and what was I earned like $1.50. Some items were purchased through them, yet did not show up on my list. I not only requested to have my items they were not listing to be sent back to me, didn’t receive them, then emailed them (Oddly the only way to contact), yet still never received anything back. I even have photos and documented everything that was shipped to them… only heard back once from them, then never again. BE VERY AWARE OF WHAT YOU SEND IN AND DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO RETURN YOUR ITEMS OUT SELL THEM FOR YOU. Ship at your own risk!!",1
586,"EQUALITY? NO MEN! WOMEN & KIDS ONLY!: I think that the fact that you do not allow men to use your website to sell or trade clothes is not only unacceptable but it’s sexist, and it also lowers the amount of users that your company is going to have. I use several apps to sell things and they all include Men and Boys. let me give you an example of why this is limiting to males, and MTF transgender individuals (say there’s a transgender individual who was a male and is now a female and this individual has a lot of name brand Men’s attire that they would like to trade or sell to get women’s attire!? They cannot unless they want to donate it all to charity. Then they can buy from your Women’s only app.) This to me is a violation of equality rights and I will be sure to inform Apple about this women’s only app. And If I am mistaken then please inform me of where the men’s section is. I just don’t think anyone should ever be excluded from anything because of their gender.",1
587,"Best deals!!: I LOVE this site/app. It takes some time to sort through (although I think it’s a lot of fun to browse all the clothes), but they’ve got some amazing items for ridiculously low prices, especially during their big sales. I paid $10 for a Nine West bag and $16 for one of my now-favorite outfits (a nice blouse and some slacks). I also got a very sturdy backpack for work for $25 and a nice button-down shirt for $4. I’m going to a fancy party next month, so I bought a previously-rented designer dress that originally cost $400 for $70. Make sure you look at the measurements for each item, not just the size! Once you know what measurements you need, this site is a goldmine.",5
588,"Convenient!: Great alternative for shopping secondhand. Used this site for about 2 years now and find some nice and diverse pieces for my wardrobe. I like most of what I buy from ThredUP- sometimes clothing photographs nicer than it is but the description tends to be accurate.  I’m obviously satisfied hence the 5 stars.

I like selling back too but my expectation is always this, “I was going to donate this anyway.” I premise this because yes, if you don’t get assurance ($10) they will not return anything they don’t list and you can get .70 cents (- +) for your “once favorite” shirt. Don’t send anything you want a big return on...I would sell those items on eBay. Only send “for fun”- seriously! Otherwise- you- May- be disappointed.",5
589,"Old Improvements Need to Come Back!: I’ve used thredUP for a while now and I have to say I am liking it less and less. Previously, even if your favorited item sold out, they had an option where you could look at similar options. 

My biggest pet peeve is that items are sorted by numerical size, and not by actual inch measurements!!! Women’s clothing sizing is notoriously inconsistent. The fact that ThredUP measures all garments but doesn’t allow you to sort through items by said measurements is so frustrating. I want to see ALL items that are my actual size, not a narrow range where half the items don’t actually fit me when I look at the measurements. I swear they used to allow us to do that and I freaking loved it. Please bring it back or add it on!! 

To add onto that, the fact that skirts only include length measurement and NOT WAIST MEASUREMENT kiiilllsss me. Like come on y’all I can’t buy something if the skirt size doesn’t fit me. 

Overall I really love this app and I’ve shopped plenty of times on it but because it’s hard for me to find items that actually fit me I’m finding myself using it less and less. Please let us sort items by ALL measurements (especially busts!!!).",3
590,"Was really excited but pretty disappointed.: I wanted to return most of my order because the quality of the clothes was not as described. “Like new” came shrunken and pilling. I wouldn’t even be mad if it was priced accordingly, it was priced way too expensive. Then I thought no problem I will just return it, that’s part of online second hand shopping right? You have to pay to return your items!!!! +the restocking fee. This is absolutely ridiculous. I am now stuck with credit because after paying all their return fees I wouldn’t get much back for my refund. I now have to buy from this company again. This is definitely my first and last time shopping second hand online. Im also stuck with two items that are non-refundable, i thought this company was all about saving the planet?  I don’t get it.",2
591,"“You might mistake it for brand new” is a fake statement!: I am new for thredUP. As usual I was thrilled by their collections of clothing in almost any brands and size when I looked up online. I ordered more than 8 apparels. I was very excited to receive my first polka dots package. But after I opened the package, I was totally disappointed with most of the clothing condition. Because they were not giving justice to their description w.r.t price and condition.
Firstly, couple of clothing with tag the price was almost same as the tagged price (foreign currency). Secondly, the description w.r.t condition wasn’t matching at all. It says you will mistake it for brand new and it was totally faded, flat looking and it was priced high for that condition. I don’t think the price and condition of the dress will be a match always. 
I don’t think it’s worth spending time for me in scouting stuff here.
I might not be a regular shopper on this site.",2
592,"Positives and negative but still worth it!: I really enjoy using thredUP. There are the obvious issues (low payouts and quality items not getting accepted) which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. However, to me the positives out weight the negatives. I would rather send my quality clothes to thredUP and get some kind of payout rather than giving them away for nothing. I do a yard sale once a year and anything that doesn’t get sold goes to thredUP. I have also had a really good experience with their customer service. They helped solve my problem and fixed a separate issue without me even having to ask. Overall, I would recommend thredUP to anyone with quality items that wants to make a few bucks rather than giving them away.",4
593,"Room to Improve: I like the concept for all of the reasons that the other positive reviews like it: good selection, high standards for clothing, and secondhand shopping reduces waste. All good. However. I often find items miscategorized or mislabeled and there is no way to notify ThredUP of the discrepancy, which I think is dumb as heck. The clothing categories and styles don’t all make sense. I also find the app to be pretty buggy. The most recent version doesn’t store my favorites and won’t delete them either. 

The UI is great and there is a ton of potential. I think it’s better than the competitors on a lot of fronts. Payouts are pretty crappy, but IMO preferable to the hassle of dealing with posting yourself. It would be 3.5 stars but since half stars aren’t an option I’m rounding up.",4
594,"Best overall resale app on the market: I have been an avid user of loads of resale apps on the App Store and this one is still my favorite. 

For Buying:

-they always have an amazing, clean, and well detailed selection at all times
-they have pretty detailed searches for however you want to narrow down your search
-they can have some serious deals on there and the packaging is always cute and neat! 
-I’ve ordered from here multiple times and every item has been clean, perfectly up to description, and neatly packed

For Selling:
-ThredUP will be the first to tell you that they don’t offer absurd amounts of money for your clothes, but don’t let that deter you
-Try using their payout estimator, it really will give you an idea of what they will pay. 
-Tips: mid-to-upper-tier designer items are pretty much the only items with a decent payouts, they don’t pay much for kids, and make sure triple check for holes and such
-that being said, this is the most reliable and uniform platform to sell your used clothes that I’ve found, counting consignment shops-and it’s super easy! 

Thanks for reading, I highly recommend!",5
595,"Good for buying, not for selling: I really love the app and the shopping experience. I would recommend buying from brands you already know your size in.  You can save SO much.  However, they’ve recently changed how they handle selling.  There’s no automatic payout, so if your items don’t sell in a certain time frame you either pay for them to be returned (lose money), they get donated, OR they will sell them later and you don’t get paid.  Um, what? And the payout is SO low. I will probably no longer sell with them.  Poshmark is better for that, as are local buy/sell sites, but I will continue to buy.  I just don’t know how they will keep up quality inventory with this pattern for consigners.",5
596,"Beware of ThredUP: Beware of buying or selling with this company! First if you plan to sell your items through ThredUP, plan to be scammed. I’ve seen amazing deals for buyers; knowing very well that an item on sale is worth $200 more than what they listed it for. You will not make a dime. The warnings you read are true. Secondly, the customer service is horrible. Plan to spend days waiting on a response...if they ever get back to you. Then let’s talk about shipping. Plan to wait 10-15 days to receive your order. If you pay for expedited shipping, it will still come late. I once paid for rushed shipping, it came so late, I missed the order for my trip & the clothes sat on my porch for 10 days! What a waste. This time they sold an item out from under me. This company is disorganized, inconsistent and has the worst service I’ve ever dealt with. I will not be back...and I plan to take everyone with me. Should have responded to me days ago. Still waiting!!!",1
597,"Mislabeled items, non-existent customer service,: Two out of three items in the last purchase I made were mislabeled. Neither was the brand the site claimed it was. (Showing the label would be helpful, but the site for some reason does not do so.) so I wanted to return the non-returnable items because they were not as advertised.
Tracking down customer support should not be this difficult. ThredUp claims to allow you to email or live chat, but there’s no email address listed on the site. The so-called live chat is a bot that dead-ends if your complaint does not fit a very narrow set of parameters. I was able to kind of trick it into spitting out a prompt for an email help request, but after one customer support person emailed me, she never responded again. Maddening. 
(Also interesting—I am having trouble submitting this review—all 6 names I’ve tried have already been used.)",1
598,"Final sale items are nonreturnable: FYI final sale items cannot be returned. If they don’t fit. If they aren’t as described. If they don’t look like you hoped. 
$1.99 restocking fee for returned items. $8.99 processing fee to receive a refund. These are the most important fees to understand. 
These are also not apparent unless you scroll down and expand the returns menu. 
The fit is described well; very accurately, so +2 stars, but the condition of some items received was not, so -2 stars. One item was described as having minor wear but also had an unmentioned stain. One item was described as having minor wear, but the waist fastener was nearly separated from the material, there are several loose seams all over, and the waist has signs of iron burns. 
But the other 9 items were as described. 
It only seems fair to give 3 stars because of the fees associated with returning these items and receiving a refund. It is basically “at your own risk” that their products arrive as described. 
Just pay attention to whether item is a FINAL SALE description because you won’t be able to return it, and if you can, you’ll lose $2/item, and either receive “store credit” or lose $9 for processing.",3
599,"Ehh....: This is a good idea in theory. The clothes you buy are usually pretty good, but the prices they are charge are almost a joke! Some of the prices are just about as expensive as brand new! And I would NOT send any clothes to them to sell if you want any pay out at all! Just donate to an organization or secondhand store you trust. Recently sent a bag of stuff to them and was notified after the fact that their selling policies had changed and was pure consignment now. Which was advertised as a way to “get more money.” That’s a joke. You only get paid if your stuff sells. I could be wrong- but you would probably have better luck selling on poshmark!! Customers used to complain about their selling and payouts before, and I would argue its much worse now. I think I’m just done with thredup, unfortunately- at least I’ll no longer be sending them any of my own clothes.",2
600,"UGH: Thanks for nothing, ThredUP!! The most annoying- way too many emails-impossible to use on mobile devices- website. All you had to do was recommend using your app. I lost my order COUNTLESS times and your service desk was totally useless. Both the chat and email people. My daughter figured it out.  I KNOW I had credits to use but no credit card worked for my order!! I lost 5 days on this!! Just totally infuriating. Your searches are way too inaccurate and repetitive in the wrong ways. Get a new developer for your website, please! Pay the right people the right amount to fix this mess. Thanks. I finally was able to order, but lost half the things I wanted.  Ugh. Just ugh.",5
601,"Yay for used clothes! Slight changes to favorites & cart features needed: Love this app and all the filters so you can really hone in on what you’re looking for. I am particular about exact fabric percentages/content since they’ll last longer  (I like all natural materials with no spandex or elastane- 100% linen, cotton etc.) so if there could be a way to hone in even further on only 100% natural fabrics that would be incredible. Only suggestion I currently have is add a way to see when looking at favorites whether or not they’ve already been added to my cart so I can see what’s left in my favorites to shop. It can get a little confusing trying to remember what’s already been added to my shopping cart.",5
602,"Be aware!! Buy at your own risk!!: If you are trying to sell something through Thredup, don’t!!!! They give you VERRRY low prices. Hardly not worth your time. Just drop it off at GoodWill or sell them through Ebay or Poshmark.
If you are trying to buy something through Thredup. PLEASE READ!!! Even though they advertise a product as excellent condition, like new, they are not in new condition. It is more like a gamble, because they will charge 8.99 for return shipping fee even when they advertised it wrong. I have purchased products they advertised as NEW CONDITION and have holes from moths, rips, and tears! Even the New with tag had holes. I don’t think their quality control staff looks at their merchandise thoroughly.  When the items are returned, if you want a refund in the original form of payment, shipping of 8.99 was charged. They WILL NOT refund your shipping fee. If you must buy something from them, BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. Your purchases will not be guaranteed.",1
603,"This company is a scam. Would give 0 stars if I could: I've been (for some unknown reason) using ThredUP for years as a buyer and a seller. They give you almost NO money for your clothes. I'm talking maybe .50 per piece. They claim that because they are up front about their horrible payouts that it's totally okay. In addition, their pricing on used clothing is absurd. You can get better prices with sale items in the stores. And lastly, I think they may keep things for themselves. I sent an adorable top from Loft that I wore once. Was still in the season I purchased it and they didn't accept it. I'm sure one of them is running around wearing it. I hate this company. Will never use them again. Wish I could just get my clothes back and donate them to charity. I feel like they are just robbing people. And I'm so mad at myself for how many times I've sent in clothing just wanting to declutter and thinking this time will be different. What a sham.",1
604,"Insane. Absolutely ridiculous.: There is no constant percentage that Thread Up takes. In order to get 80% off the profit (which, on Poshmark, is the constant percentage that you get), you have to sell something for over $800!!!!!! On Poshmark, I can sell a shirt for $25 and get 80%. Terrible customer service. Do. Not. Use. You are better off taking your clothes to a local consignment store or using Poshmark (a buying and selling app where you list items for yourself instead of sending them to some random place in the U.S.). Also, how am I supposed to know that the clothes that they don’t take and sell through my account aren’t being sold through someone else’s? For all I know, the 90% off the bag that I sent that they declined could be being sold through some random server in Asia for over retail and Thread Up could be cheating me out of hundreds of dollars. 
Unless you’re willing to risk your money and send your clothes off, DONT USE THIS APP.",1
605,"WORTH IT!: amazing store. As a person who grew up only being able to shop at thrift stores, I defiantly grew to appreciate them more the more I found i that were of quality and something I actually loved. But there was still this part of me that went to online stores that I defiantly could never afford and make wish lists of stuff I know I’d never be able to buy because I couldn’t bring myself to pay $30 or more for a shirt. To get what you want, from the brands you admire, in the styles you like for half the price is too good to be true! This store and app are a God send! I will defiantly be doing most of my shopping from here.",5
606,"Restocking fee: I have been using thredup for a couple of years now. I really enjoy this service and almost exclusively get my clothes from here. I have left a positive review in the past. However, this new restocking fee bothers me. $1.99 per item? That seems a little steep to me. My biggest issue for returning things is bc of the length. The lengths listed are very often wrong. I am returning pants right now that the inseam is listed incorrectly in the description. There does not seem to be consistency when measuring items. I can buy multiple pairs of pants with allegedly the same inseam and they are all different, dresses and skirts are the same. Im buying things in good faith that the measurements are correct only to be disappointed to find out they are not. Why should I pay $1.99 to restock an item I would have kept if the items lengths were as listed. Other than this I love thredup!",2
607,Not as expected: I purchased here with so excitement and when I opened the box I was like NO WAY!!! The skirt the top did NOT look like the picture. Others were old and worn out. One said it was a top it was a dress!! Description said “minimal wear if any” well I literally threw it in the garbage. There is no refund on most of what is bought because they know once you get it and it looks worn and old you will want to return it and you can’t. I was so disappointed in 5 items of the 8 things I purchased. I will never buy from ThredUp again! I’ve purchased on eBay Posh etc and this was awful. The quality of those 5 items were awful!!! With a description and fake brushed up picture to make them look good. They brighten up the pics so beware you may or may not get what you think you’re buying. So disappointed,2
608,"Excellent way to thrift :): Thrifting irl generally means popping in some earbuds and spending an hour+ sifting through racks organized by type and sometimes color. However, on ThredUp you can organize by color, style, length, size, pattern, etc. I've always had trouble finding shorts but because ThredUp puts the inseam in the description I was able to order 3 that fit!

Something i hope they update: you can sort skirts by ""short"", ""knee length"", ""calf length"", etc. but not by inches. You can sort pants by inseam inches, and the inch lengths are in the description, but you can't filter for them. You have to manually check the inch length, and I hope they fix that.",5
609,"Something’s going on at ThredUP: I’ve been using this company for years. They had a great response rate with clean out bags, customer service was great and so nice, and the prices for shipping and the clothes were perfect for what I was looking for. It was my favorite place to shop…
Unfortunately after the pandemic I think something happened. I don’t want to complain about ThredUP and what I’ve noticed because I really do like them. I’m just not happy about certain changes and it has made me change my mind in purchasing there from time to time. When they have a sale though…. That’s probably best time to shop especially if you have any coupon codes. Otherwise, I think I’m going to wait and see how this all plays out. Something has to be going on.",3
610,"Addicting: I just found thredup last month during quarantine because I missed shopping! Oh my goodness do I love it! They have great products at pretty good prices! They offer a lot of discounts for first time shoppers too and free shipping which has been awesome. I got my first Kate spade purse that I’ve been wanting for years and paid a quarter of the price of what it would have been brand new and it’s in perfect condition. Returns are easy too. I’ve gotten some clothing items and if they don’t fit I can send them back for free and get the credit back in my account. 
Overall I’m very impressed with this company, it’s products, shipping, packaging, and customer service. The app is very easy to navigate as well.",5
611,"Great for sustainable shopping!: I have been shopping on thredup for almost 4 years and I love it! Just downloaded the app and it works great! My one complaint is about searches. Every time I search ‘urban outfitters’, clothing from Anthropologie shows up in the results. I understand that they’re owned by the same man but they have very different and distinct aesthetics! A person who likes UO often doesn’t have the taste for Anthro and it can be slightly annoying to sift through. This happens for American Apparel as well. That search often yields tacky shirts that have the AA tag with a design on the front. Things that weren’t actually sold at an AA store or on the website. This hasn’t kept me from shopping on thredup, it just takes more time for me to find what I’m looking for.",4
612,"Great idea and company: I decided to try Thred up, just because it sounded kind me of cool I had never tried any of these types of services.
When my box arrived honestly I didn’t know what it was I put it aside and just got busy with whatever was going on at that time. Later I really checked out the box and realized what it was so I eagerly opened up the box. When I saw all the cute clothes I kept pulling out I was ecstatic! Just amazing stuff. So I started wearing the new clothes the next day to work, by Thursday so many people had seen my new wardrobe they all asked me what was going on how come I was dressing so amazing? I just told them all to try Thred-up.... hopefully they did!
Very happy I decided to try this service.",5
613,"Prices keep getting higher - they forgot it’s “used” clothes: When I first found this site I was excited by the concept. I have been disappointed with almost every purchase. There is no easy way to make a return if things don’t fit. I purchased 2 pairs of designer shoes and both required new heels and one pair had to have the soles re-glued (completely separated from the shoe while at a party on their first wearing (mortified). I even sent a bag of clothing in for resale. I received a grand total of $3.00 (three whole dollars) for some VERY nice, well maintained items, several of which have simply disappeared. I notice their prices to purchase keep going higher and fewer promo codes apply to items once you “favorite” them. This is RESALE. We are looking for deals, not what we would pay at TJ Maxx for the same item new. Sadly, unless they make adjustments soon, I’m cutting the Thred ✂️",2
614,"Don’t sell or buy here: I’ve tried selling and buying and have always been disappointed. 

On the buying end: Their photos are poor quality, so the items usually look different in person than they do in pictures, especially regarding the color. If you have to do a return, they charge a “restocking fee” that is outrageously high for used clothing. 

On the selling end: The payout is abysmal compared to in-person second-hand stores like Buffalo Exchange, and the rules around what they do and don’t accept are arbitrary. You have to pay $15 to ensure your non-selected items are sent back to you. I’ve sent in high-end designer clothes and handbags in excellent condition, assuming they would be sold, and then had them not selected.. and never seen them again. They say that they “recycle” unused items, but I imagine more likely they end up in employees’ wardrobes. Support your local second-game stores and give ThredUp a pass.",1
615,"Very good luck: I have purchased numerous items of clothing from thredUP over the last few years. I have only received one item in very poor condition. Ever thing else has been exactly as described for condition. Measurements in the description are not always 100% accurate, but for most items looking at the image and reading the listing I can usually guess at what is right and what is wrong. I have received so many items I love that I would never bring myself to pay full price for. Customer service as been great.  They now charge $1.99 to restock which is a bummer and causes me to be a bit more caution, however if you don’t have time to go thrifting locally regularly this site is great!",5
616,"A blast to shop: The app is great. Very user-friendly, I have found after spending some time on it it is easy to search and find what I’m looking for. The pieces I have received have been in good shape, except for one that had a different color than I had anticipated, I think that was my error. I am always able to find great prices, and buy things with promotions. I love I can freshen up my wardrobe with higher quality items I would never buy at retail price, and it’s secondhand! Win win. The one complaint I have is it takes a very long time to get items, like almost 2 weeks sometimes. I’m ok to wait, and it is a present of a box when you finally see it on your porch! Overall I love the concept and will continue to be a customer.",4
617,"Not a fan: I love buying second hand clothing but hate doing it through Thred Up! They have horrible descriptions and don’t provide any kind of measurements. The descriptions are very vague and often misguiding. I was looking at a pair of shoes that said they were Layne Bryant in the description but showed in the pictures that they were Lands End brand. Doesn’t appear that a lot of thought goes into their listings and not to mention the way they display their clothing is terrible, very wrinkled and only two pics are usually shown of the item. Also, if you need to return an item they make you pay for return shipping, which in my opinion isn’t even worth it because once you get your “refund” you’re just going to spend it on your return shipping anyway. I personally have never gone through their customer service for anything but from what I’ve heard that’s a horror story in itself. Won’t be buying from Thred Up anymore.",1
618,"I. Am. Addicted.: I love love L-O-V-E ThredUP! The inventory is all great stylish brand names and at prices that are 90% retail. Thrift store shopping gets annoying since it’s pawing through every rack but with ThredUP you can filter through their inventory by brand, color, price, pattern, length, heel height, etc. And the best part of all is they are constantly updating their inventories with the clothes they receive so you can check multiple times a day for whatever you’re looking for or just to browse. Now that I have spent $150+ this month and I get free shipping all of next month, my wallet is going to suffer. But the fact that by shopping secondhand clothes you are saving the planet, makes every purchase I make through ThredUP so totally worth it.",5
619,"Happy shopper since 2016.: I’m obsessed with Thred up. I tell all my friends, all clients. 
84 orders since 2016 most over 20 items a piece.  I went back and looked at all previous orders. They keep track of it. I love that as well can I can always go back and look at a brand, size, and price. 
I cannot say enough about what a great company this is. I can search by size, color, brand etc. I’m obsessed with a certain dress and I want it in every color it came in. I can search my size every couple of days and I am up to 7 of them. I know obsessed. If I love it I want it in every color. 
Great prices and if there is ever a issue they always fix it.",5
620,"Five ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: I have to say that through my experience with this app, some of the best pieces I have in my collection have come from thredUP that’s why I give it five stars. However, I encourage everyone to look very closely at all of the details in the description of what it is you’re buying because you have to keep in mind that it is a thrift store and some of my purchases have been in disappointing condition. I take the of the blame for that for not paying close attention to the condition of the piece. with that being said, pay close attention to the condition of what you’re buying and you’ll have a wonderful experience with thredUP. ✌🏽",5
621,"Eh: Used to be better, in my opinion. They don’t really pay out very well anymore. Even if you send pretty nice stuff. I’ve sent in some quality items that they never even listed. I don’t have much money and try to be mindful of what I purchase and I don’t think that they’re as fair as they used to be. It seems like they kind of sold out on their own idea. Not too be like super negative or anything, but that’s just what I’ve noticed. Still better to look here than buy brand new..but like.. I’ve bought items that I didn’t love on here too, that I felt weren’t really accurately described and then didn’t want to pay to send them back, just fyi. It’s okay. I still shop on here sometimes, but it used to be better. Just things to think about",3
622,"Great for Thrifting Anytime: There are so many clothing items and options for searching, I have gotten many great finds from Thred-up! The prices are a little bit more than going to your local thrift store, but I have found the quality has been better and the fact you can return items (most local thrift stores don’t allow this) is a benefit as well. Because of thred-up, my closet is about 1/3 thrifted items! 

It does take time to learn how to narrow down options, but once you learn to use all the features to your favor you can find amazing finds (recently I bought $50 dr. Martens from using the saved search option!)",5
623,"Nifty Thrify: I’ve really enjoyed using the ThredUP app! I used to shop on their website but find it’s much easier to examine the photos up close on the app. One thing that ThredUP could do to improve would be to provide more measurements for items. For example, for skirts, only the length measurement is provided. Since sizing is so different across brands, it’s very hard to determine if something will fit in the waist just going by the size. A waist measurement would help greatly. At this time, I mainly stick to brands that I know my size in to avoid purchasing items that don’t fit. With that being said, I still really enjoy using the app to be a thrifty shopper!",5
624,"Ok but promotions are a scam: I love being able to online shop from my phone. However I had an issue with their site and contacted customer support. They reset my password (not sure why since the original issue was a link to download a return label wasn’t working) and after I log in using the new password, all my account information was lost. Including the entire month of promotional points I earned and entered. I usually don’t care about this stuff however I specifically made several purchases this month for those promotional points. 

Once I contacted customer service again I was told they can’t help me and their management will be in contact within 24-48 hours, conveniently after the promotional month has ended. 

Also they mark up their items heavily so I’d always google  search before you purchase because you can find cheaper elsewhere.",1
625,"I’m addicted: So I love this app. I use it for all my outfit planning and buying. The only things  I wish for is a way to tell me how far down the page I am. As in the line that tells you, but with a number so I know how much of the page is left. I often want to go look for something else but am worried that I won’t see exactly what I’m looking for. Another thing is the notifications. I’ve tried to mess with them and make it so I have less, but my whole Notification Center is full of things from threadup. And the shipping price always stops me from ordering a $20 order because $6 is a lot! And to have a hoodies sections would be nice.",5
626,"ThredUp: fun to look at, not to buy: I have bought a number of items from ThredUp over the past 8 months or so. The accuracy of the descriptions on quality vary. Once I received a dress that said was “like new” only to find the hem had come loose in some parts and it had piling and some runs in the material. Also another item that was supposedly “gently used” was missing buttons and even had a strap poorly sewn on. ThredUp policy is not  suppose to allow for these type of altered clothing to be sold. Not much in the grand scheme (I know how to sew), but it’s the principal of the matter, I don’t like being mislead.  I have gotten clothes that I’ve enjoyed and had endless hours of entertainment searching for clothes, the reason I have repeatedly used this app. I would not recommend ThredUp to anyone, ever. It’s an addictive trap.",3
627,"Customer service 👎🏻: I like buying used clothes so I buy here alot so 2 stars would be for your items and fast shipping. Your customer service is on another level tho because of one order that didn’t get to me even if the package says delivered. I tried reaching out to them and said that they’d help me out. It has been 10 days since I last contacted them and no one has replied back to me yet. I also sent alot of emails to get an update but nothing. You can’t even call them. 🤷🏻‍♀️

If the dress i bought was cheap, i would have let it go but i was gonna use it for my wedding. You guys have to respond to me or give me a solution somehow.",5
628,"Return costs are unreasonable: I overall LOVE ThredUP. However their cost return items is too high.  There is normally at $1.99 restocking fee coupled with $8.99 return shipping, the base shipping for ordering is $5.99.  This is secondhand clothing, I’ve bought several items and I’ve only had 1 item costs over $10 so returning isn’t possible it’s more like all sales under a certain $ are final. Which is fine but than state that from the jump. Honesty of the 10 or so items I’ve bought in the 1 month since I’ve been using thredUP only 1 item I’ve wanted to return but it does prevent me from potentially buying more as I don’t want to take a chance.",5
629,"Absolutely love ThredUP: This is the beat thing ever!!! I love thrift shopping for a number of reasons, one because I can find old styles and colors that are not currently being sold. Two, the PRICES, three, it’s already been washed, I don’t have to worry about shrinkage and it has that lived in feel I love. ThredUP makes the thrift buying process so EASY!! Instead of pilfering through aisles and aisles, I just type in what I want and BAM! There it is! That combined with great sales and discount codes all the time, I am basically re-buying my entire wardrobe from ThredUP since losing weight!!! Can’t say enough good things, if you haven’t tried it, do so immediately!! I have an order on expedited shipping for a vacation right now!!!!!",5
630,"A loyal customer!!!: I have been a loyal customer for a few years now(both buying and selling). Very rarely am I disappointed. Give thredUP a try, I have found that they tend to overstate flaws (I have sent in brand new never worn clothes to sell that they have said had minor flaws that I KNOW had none on them) but I guess I would rather buy an item that says it has a minor flaw ONLY to be pleasantly surprised when it arrives in great condition. Customer service via email is VERY slow, so that is my only negative(can be 5 days until they get back to you which is REALLY TOO SLOW- that needs fixed thredUP!!!)
I get about 75% of my wardrobe through thredUP and make it my first “go to site”
Cindy",5
631,"Better options for selling exist.: Don't consign with thred up. It has turned into a total scam. they charge a processing fee that comes out of your sales. They priced my clean out kit at prices so low, with consignment percentage so high, I couldn't reach even the processing fee. This allows them to keep all of the proceeds. A feature that was new to me this go round (I used them years ago and it was way more worth it) is that you have to add the details- going through and categorizing & filling in details for the written description. This is work you'd have to do on a site like mercari or poshmark, with them only taking a few pictures that are mediocre. You are getting charged for doing most of the work anyhow so you might as well do it yourself. Hope this saves at least one person the hassle I just went through. Going to continue selling my items on my own.",1
632,"Very Hit or Miss: I am providing this feedback based solely on the products I have purchased and not about the stellar App, customer service, nice packaging and adequate website. 

I have only purchased a few times. The first time I had a good experience. All the items were as expected and good quality. 

The second time I am a little disappointed. I am a woman’s size 10. Three of the dresses I ordered are size 10 with the manufacturer tag. These dresses are in reality not at all a size 10. They were maybe a size 4-6 or Childs size 10. The cute button up blouse from American Eagle also marked size 10 wouldn’t even go past the breasts for closure. 

The size 10 blouse from Anthropologie, skirt from Banana Republic and chinos from Gap were spot on size 10. 

Not certain what the problem is and I know  sizes very greatly but this was a big disappointment to me. All items were very low priced so not worth it to send back and pay 3.99 per item for re stocking. I shall pay them forward to my daughter and be very deliberate when I shop on ThredUP again. 

This is a great resale store and do recommend it.",4
633,Not really thrift store prices: I liked this app at first. Found a few nice pieces. So far I have gotten 1 defective jacket and 1 item that was supposed to be 100% cotton and it ended up being 93% polyester. Help is basically nonexistent and hard to find. There’s a fee for returning items and there was no way to tell them the item was not as described in both cases. The return fee makes returning the items not worth it. So out of four orders 2 orders contained items that were not as described. Some of the clothing sells on ThredUp for as much as it is new. Not good for buying one or two items at a time as their shipping fees are high unless you order over $80 worth of stuff. Orders take a while to reach you and their tracking is not always up to date. Not recommended.,3
634,"Love this app- so close to perfect!: I absolutely love everything about thredup-   Sustainable, responsible, great working app. The only thing I wish you could do is select multiple types of items/clothing categories for your search (like pants AND jeans). At the moment you can only search for one category and that’s slightly annoying. All other search features are excellent.  I’d also like to request that you can save and label an outlet search.. or have some way to be able to make sure you’ve saved and added the correct amount of outlet items for the desired discount.  Thank you thredup for keeping our wardrobes alive and reducing our effect on the environment! Keep up the awesomeness.",4
635,"Best I’ve found: I love the prices, options, and filtering features. The shipping is affordable. I am waiting what seems like an infinite amount of time to receive my two orders which are being bundled. Which is nice that they’re being bundled and hopefully shipped with reducing emissions in mind. Also, give a mouse a cookie on this one - I would like to be able to sort certain fabric contents out of the results. Fabric content is one of the first things I look for and looking for mostly or only natural fiber content in clothes in this environment is quite time consuming. I think it might be a lot easier to filter out the popular synthetic fibers. I’d love to see this be an option and would gain five stars from me!",4
636,"Love the app, hate the update: Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE shopping here, the clothes are always in good condition and the prices are nice, BUT the update will really hinder me from shopping on here as often. 

I had almost 900 points saved up to spend on my next purchase, unfortunately at the moment I don’t have much money to splurge right now (I just got married and we’ve been going through some financial hardship) but I was really excited to spend them on the next pay check that I got. When I updated and opened the app I found that the update took all of my points away and left me with a measly 81. I’m not joking. I saved up the points to get $10 off my next purchase so I could get something for myself for the new year and everything was gone. 

With the update I can’t earn the points as fast as I could have before. Unfortunately the only way you can earn a lot of points is to buy and I just don’t have the money for it and to be honest, the “perks” you get from each tier aren’t really worth it unless you spend $1000 a year on the app. 

ThredUp: please bring back daily login rewards!!! That was one of the only ways I could afford to buy from here because of the shipping costs!",2
637,"Was absolutely great for buying for low cost but...: I have been using thread up for like a year now and they are amazing . Clothes come on time for the most part ad advertised and reasonable for consignment . 

My issue is with the clean out bags .. the payout is horrible for what they get for the items you send . I had seen reviews on that aspect of the company but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt since everything had gone fine . The reviews were right. I guess I would be better off walking the clothes into a consignment store that’s local for a chance a higher store credit amount . So sad I’ve been recommending the clean out to many of my friends as well as for purchases . 

I’ve also returned things and have not received refunds or alerts or notes on the account in the app .",3
638,"Love the market place and clean out feature: I got into thread up via the Jenna Julien podcast and found a fantastic way to get quality second hand clothes easily. I prefer to buy second hand as much as I can, better to reuse rather than buy new, and have made a few purchases so far. That said, some of their prices are a little high, ex a faded glory T-shirt from Walmart wasn’t worth $12 new and it certainly isn’t worth that used. The clean out feature is awesome though. I’m set to make about $50 for my bag. I did accidentally ship one of my bags with a donate label so make sure you double check before you ship it out. All in all, Thread Up is a fantastic marketplace for quality thrifting.",5
639,"Amazing: I wish I was paid to promote them lol seriously this store is just so great. I love how they include measurements for everything so you know exactly what you’re getting, honestly I get a better fit by shopping here online than at stores and the whole experience is a lot easier (their several filters deliver exactly what I’m looking for and it’s so easy to get brand new pieces!). I’ve been ordering for a couple years I think at this point half of my closet is thredup with brands I couldn’t afford otherwise. Only a few items so far didn’t fit great but mostly because I didn’t check the measurements. Totally recommend!",5
640,"New to the site and loving it!: Serendipity is the word I’d use to describe my discovery of ThredUp. I was searching the web for a new source for women’s clothes and ThredUp appeared. Since that time a few months ago, I’ve already placed 3 bundled orders ( which saves me shipping) and am working on my 4th. 
The site is easy to maneuver and the diversity is amazing. Whether you’re looking for a specific designer or just looking for an item, you’ll find it. If you do search a designer, you’ll receive notifications when items matching your search are added. It’s great!
It’s not often when doing something good for the planet can be so much fun. Using ThredUp is one of those times. Try it , you’ll love it.",5
641,"Inconsistent sizing!: I totally love this app and being able to buy quality goods for a fraction of the price! Everyone should use this site. However one problem I’ve continued to see is in accurate sizing. Under the brand on the item page it lists what size, and then down at the bottom for details it has the measurements. More often than not I’ve gotten things with wrong sizing because I was looking at what it said right under the brand rather than the details further down below. I.E. I just bought a pair of pants labeled size 4, to look into further measurement details further down the page, and it has the waist measurement of 32. That’s a size 14! That is very frustrating and misleading. I shouldn’t have to look twice as a customer. Please fix. I want to continue using your app.",3
642,"Fabulous online consignment: A great discovery!! An online consignment store that can be tailored to your size/wants/needs in the comfort of your home. I am a new fan, but I already get the sense that this company is fun, energetic and focused on the age-old concept of “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure”. I now have a fabulous Armani skirt hanging in my closet that I paid a fraction of price for. There are thrift and consignment stores in the area where I live, but many of the items are of low quality and/or stained/worn and really should “rest in peace” in the trash. I am highly pleased that this company allows one to make use of filters and choose to view items that are brand new or are in mint condition. I highly recommend!!! :)",5
643,"App needs more information: I’ve ordered using this app many times over the last couple years. I’ve noticed that the item descriptions are lacking in the areas of measurements and material descriptions. I’ve ordered from it and the app will say the item is so great I’ll mistake it for brand new, but when I get it it’s not what is described. I also found that the size descriptions are also wrong sometimes too. I ordered a dress paid $40+ for it, app said it was a size 8, and when I get it it’s actually an extra small. Returns are easy but can take up to 2 weeks. My last 2 orders have been 2 or 3 articles and I have to send back 1 or 2 due to sizing or incorrect details on the item descriptions. I want to love it, but am very wary of spending more money when the descriptions are so inaccurate.",3
644,Favorite Online Secondhand Store: ThredUp is seriously the best it’s my preferred place to get my clothes! I love it so much and have been using it for around 4 years now. If you have the time and love scrolling through clothes like I do it really is the best. My favorite is that we can customize the search as much as possible to only see the results we want to see. I love doing it by color bc it’s the one thing that is always listed so I can have fewer options show up without overwhelming myself. I can’t recommend this app enough and I know I’ll continue to use it for years to come and adding super cute clothes to my closet for a deal! <3,5
645,"Will change the price of items IN YOUR CART!: They have gotten into the habit lately of constantly changing prices.  The percentage off during sales of individual items will fluctuate with no rhyme or reason.  I didnt think it happened if something was in your cart but it does! This is a horrendous business practice and it’s stopped me from making anymore orders after dozens in years past.  Also items will be listed for years taking up space in a warehouse while they add more and more everyday.  And the vast majority of the stuff are brands that they don’t payout people for so pure profit for them, therefore prices should be much lower.  Things would sell better.  Ive honestly started to wonder if their business model isnt primarily about making sales and instead revolves around something else entirely.  Or maybe it’s just horribly run. Regardless… I’m done.",1
646,"App is a terrible shopping experience in 2023: I primarily shopped from ThredUP the past few years and used to be happy about the sustainability, affordability, and original pieces. 

The app and concept completely did a 180 in the past year. It’s somehow more expensive and time consuming to send clothes in to sell, there are a million rules and codes that make it difficult to figure out the price of anything, and the entire shopping experience is now terrible. 

My biggest complaint is how glitchy the app functions. The prices change by the second, and will even change after adding it to a shopping cart. Customer service recommends to send screenshots of these changes (?), but there is no actual plan for them to honor the original, lower price. This is frustrating but larger than a poor shopping experience, I do not see how this is not illegal to change prices in this way. 

Maybe I’ll get lucky with a random piece here and there, but largely this app is a huge waste of time now. The prices are more expensive than new in most situations, but it is truly maddening to operate this app that changed prices constantly or makes items fully disappear. I felt pretty zen about the low payouts before, but now I think it is actually a full scam.",1
647,"I like thredUP but the app is not great: I think thredUP is a great way to buy clothes but the app needs some help. If these are fixed my review would easily be five stars. 

The filters don’t work at all rendering them completely useless. What’s the point of having filters if they don’t actually filter anything? I’m tall and therefore need jeans with a longer inseam but when choosing the higher inseam range it still gives me inseams that are way shorter. Also when choosing a Jean style (flare, straight, etc) it doesn’t actually narrow it down to just that section. 

The search function is also pointless. You can type in flare jeans all you want but you’ll still everything. 

This makes it really hard to shop on a app that already has a ton to sort through. 

A suggestion for a feature is when searching for a brand and an item if there is nothing in someone’s certain sizes the app could suggest something that does match the criteria but in a different size. It would make it so much easier to find things I like even if they may be slightly out of my size range without having to reset size filters each time.",3
648,"Favorite way to shop!: I absolutely love thredup. I love what they stand for and how they seek to cultivate a more educated consumer. Fast fashion serves am enormous threat to our planet with 2,656 kilos of clothes being burned or entering landfills every day. This platform does a great job of motivating waste and you get great clothes at awesome prices! Also what other place can you RETURN your consigned good?! Nowhere! But at thredup you can which makes committing to an item less stressful if you aren’t sure about the fit. 

There is definitely room to improve thredup and I’ve talked to one member of their team about it after recently signing up for thredup. I thought they were open to feedback and passionate about what they do.",5
649,"My Favorite Site For Modern and Vintage Clothing: I’ve recently got into vintage clothing and I have found a lot of Closet Cosplay like items from this site. The company takes your concerns and recommendations seriously and I have enjoyed every item I’ve purchased. Returning items were just as easy as ordering them. I was recommended this site by Rachel Maskey, a vintage enthusiast youtuber, and have enjoyed it sense. The company is still young, but I can’t wait to see how it evolves in the future.
My only issue I would like to bring up is that they could improve their search engine to sort clothing better. They could also add a way to select your size measurements as well as the numeral size chart (and note the difference of sizes between Europe and USA).",4
650,"Its a hit or miss: I bought a lot of things from thredUP but the quality varies when buying from an online thrift store. I received clothes that smell bad although they should be sanitized due to COVID-19 but I received just as many normal smelling clothes.

The app itself could use some improvements. There are some items like belts and accessories that only have one photo so you can’t see what it really looks like. Also, you can’t sort from oldest to newest, only newest to oldest. This is a problem for people trying to sell on thredUP because the site employees update every hour. The items get buried to the bottom of the feed and become harder to sell. Items also are pulled off the app after x amount of time so you can’t find items that are soon to be pulled off. They just disappear.",3
651,"Difficult to find items unless you care solely about brand: I recommend adding keywords to specific products as you list them. Like if leggings have pockets- say that. That’s an example of a huge selling point that you’d get more sales from. Same thing with many other items. Some people don’t care much about brand, they care more about specific details. Like a type of cut or POCKETS. Just some more details in the listings to make things easier for people to find. Tell the people listing things to imagine it was their item- how would they list it if they wanted it sold fast? Or if they were looking for that item, what key details could you maybe add to trigger any search terms you’d be using? I’m not sure about thred up as a seller yet, but as a buyer those are my suggestions.",3
652,"Great customer service: Although their return policy is subject to fees and limitations typically, I received something that was a different color than advertised and it is an option to return for free in that case for a full refund; however, I still liked the jacket regardless of the wrong color so I sent a message asking if I could receive some store credit instead and they instantly refunded me the full amount and I don’t have to return the item. It was quick and easy! I haven’t had great luck with shoes fitting because my feet vary in size based on brand, but every article of clothing I’ve got fits perfectly and looks great. This will be how I obtain 95% of my clothes from now on!",5
653,"Horrible Selling Experience: This company keeps disappointing me. I wrote a review about how long it took to get the clean out bags in the first place and now that they have been processed I’m shocked at how bad the descriptions are. I sent them new designer items and they said they are used with scuffs? The pictures are pretty bad quality that don’t even show how good the items are. I had numerous items that were off the shoulder tops and they labeled them as short sleeved and took the photos that don’t even show that they are off the shoulder. This is supposed to be a professional selling website and they can’t even tell that a top is off the shoulder? Also, there were tons of spelling mistakes. Pretty sure a Hinge sweater shouldn’t be labeled as a Pinge sweater. Do you guys have people who proofread before you post these online? I could have written these descriptions and taken these photos better in my bedroom. Very disappointed.",1
654,"App crashes a ton: The app crashes so often- literally ever single time I use its vey frustrating. The clean out bag time is months and it is also frustrating. Prices are good and I feel better knowing my carbon footprint is better because I shop second hand and the selections are vast. I wish I could filter the type of handbag though bc there are so many and I only want to look at certain styles. Plus, I hope they can get better about labeling the clothes correctly as often I am searching for something and see a toddler piece in with my women's clothes. This makes me wonder what good stuff I'm missing out on when I filter when I'm searching for something specific.",5
655,"Not the best for selling: This might be ok for buying, but it’s not great for selling. Mind you, I also sell on eBay, Mercari, Poshmark, Vinted, Depop and local consignment shops. To start off, there’s  no guarantee they will take your items and if you want them sent back, you have to pay. It then takes them 1-2 months to process your order. The icing on the cake is, they only pay you about 5% of what they're selling it for. For your dress that they're selling for $23, they will give you $3-4. You would get that at a garage sale. So if you just want to get rid of stuff, its great but if you actually want money for your stuff, find another app. I will say that the app is very sleek and user friendly but as an experienced seller, I would not recommend for selling. They are stingy and you have to wait way too long.",3
656,"Great clothes and great prices: Lots of clothes at great prices. At first it was overwhelming to look through everything, but if you peek one or more times a day you can see the latest postings and find some great pieces. I’m really picky and have been surprised by how many items I’ve really liked. The goody box is pretty risk free. They don’t ask enough questions about your style to really be able to do a great job, but if you “favorite” a lot then it probably gets better. I’ve only ordered one so far and it wasn’t a win. They offered to send me a second one without the $10 deposit so I’m giving it a second try. The biggest downside for me is how long the shipping takes. Hard to be patient, but if you’re not in a hurry it’s worth it.",4
657,"Clean Out Kit: I ordered a clean out kit over the summer and received the kit rather quickly, which was nice. I do have several complaints, however. I sent them A LOT of nice clothes and received barely any money back for the clothes they did decide to sell. Not only that, but it took them over three months to receive my bag and give me money back for only a few items that were in my clean out kit. I only received $3.50 for 4 items total. All of them were new clothes/shoes that had not been used and they were up to date with the latest trends. I do not recommend that you give them your clothes if you’re looking to make extra cash. You would probably have more luck selling your clothes at a local consignment shop. They would most likely offer you more money than ThredUP. Overall I was really disappointed with my ThredUP experience.",2
658,"8 years shopping and going strong: This is my go to place to buy clothes for myself. I have seen ThredUp change and evolve several times over the years and I’m still a fan. I love that I can purchase better quality clothing items than I could afford at retail prices and I keep them out of the landfill at the same time. I send in my clothing when it does fit to be recycled or resold to someone else. The kids clothing pricing still has a way to go and I do not feel it is cost effective to purchase those items yet, but I only buy my own things here! Know your sizes and your brands and you will be happy.",5
659,Do not use this company! They steal from you: For the second time I noticed that not everything I shipped to them was listed. Given it takes months to list things id often forget what I mailed in. But realized at one point I knew items that mailed in were never put on sale. The last time I sent things in was July 22 and they were not listed until January 23. In july  I made sure to write a list of everything I sent to them. I found the list today and noticed at least 3 of the items I mailed in were not accounted for. If the items they listed One was listed as unavailable???!? No one could buy it so thredup is keeping it. I’m convinced they are reselling these clothes so they don’t have to pay me for them.  I’ve never bought anything from them and will never. And this was the last bag I’d ever send to them. Pay attention with this company!,1
660,"Don’t use the “bundle option”: I’ve loved ThreadUp for quite a while. However, they have a new option to “bundle” your items together if they are in different locations to save on shipping and packaging. While I’ve been waiting for my order - which has been paid for- two items I ordered have suddenly become unavailable. What? Are they selling items I’ve already chosen and paid for to someone else? It’s been 10 days since I placed my order and it still hasn’t shipped and my items are disappearing. I have received refunds for both the items but that’s not the point. Send my order!",5
661,"Overall Good: As long as you never have an issue (wrong shipping address, missing package, etc) threadup is great. Customer service is very lacking though. Good luck getting in contact with anyone ever. As far as the app is concerned, the UI is pretty good, a bit of a learning curve figuring out filters and how to set up saved sizes and searches, but once you've got it you're golden. I will say the in app games (bingo, etc) and using discount codes are VERY hit or miss. Might work. Might not. But the prices are good, quality is usually good and Returns are easy, so, overall I'll give the app 4 stars. The company would probably get 3 because customer service counts for a lot and they need a lot of improvement.",4
662,"The Love of my Life: I love ThredUP. I love finding unique and timeless pieces of clothes on this site, it’s like treasure hunting to me! My only problem with the site and app itself is that the clothes that I do heart don’t always show up in my favorites page. So I’ll go through a specific category to find the item and I’ll find it and have to re heart it so that it’s fresh in my favorites. I don’t like that it doesn’t save them all and I remember that issue started happening once they updated the site. That’s just my preference but I wish it wasn’t an issue lol Otherwise, the app is very easy to use and I love checking it daily for new things!",5
663,"Love it!: I have been using thredUP for a number of years now, I absolutely love the idea of purchasing previously loved clothing at a discount and shopping more sustainably. thredUP is my go-to any time I need an outfit for an occasion or simply need to update my wardrobe. 

One suggestion I have, I agree with another reviewer, is more photographs of the clothing, in particular when there is a stain, hole, or flaw is indicated. I, too, skip over certain items because I don’t want to take the chance. Show us what the issue is and then let us decide, I would probably pass on far fewer things if I knew exactly what I might be getting myself into. Thanks!",5
664,"Keeps getting better!: I’ve been thrifting my whole life and Thredup is my go to for clothes. I can find my sizes quickly, earn rewards, and best of all I get my favorite brands at prices that fit my budget. So far all items have matched the description and I’ve had no issues with the clothes smelling or being covered with animal hair which has happened to me on other sites (Ew!). My only two suggestions would be to allow the stacking of rewards with other offer codes! Also, why don’t you sell men’s clothes? My husband prefers NWT items but doesn’t mind if they are from resell shops, so we’ve shopped for him on other resell sites.",5
665,"Could be better: I used to love ThredUP, and I still enjoy browsing, but I haven’t bought anything for a long time. The times I have bought items, I’ve been mostly happy with them. There are great deals to be found. For me, a lot of the items are way overpriced, and also inconsistent. For example, I’m not going to buy a Target brand (which is already low quality) for the price I could’ve bought it for on sale at the store, if it shows signs of wear, etc. It’s ridiculous! The prices I see for items with holes, stains, and other signs of wear are just insane. But on the other hand, I’ve seen brand new items, from a good brand, with very good prices! Please evaluate how you price items, and maybe I will start buying more items.",3
666,"Great Idea, Great App: I’ve purchased at least 3 bundles over the last 6 months, and have always loved the experience! The app is super easy to use and I love that you can favorite things and come back to them later. Most of all, I love to be able to support consignment wherever possible as fast fashion continues to be a huge environmental issue! It’s great to reuse and rebuy, and every item I’ve received has been in the condition that it was reported to be. I will say, just like any other consignment shopping, it’s easier to stick to brands that you know ahead of time so the fit and material are what you think they’re going to be.  Will absolutely continue to buy from them!",5
667,Great Alternative to Buying New: I have purchased through ThredUp four to six times this year with an average of five items each time and almost everything but three items were a win! I have been able to find high quality items most times with the tags still on or items that were barely used. I absolutely love that I have the ability to search for specific items that would otherwise hard to thrift in a store. The only feedback I have is that I wish they carried mens items. Other then that I absolutely will continue to shop through ThredUp whenever I am looking for a new item or looking to update my wardrobe.,5
668,"Terrible selling experience: I have sent clothing to ThredUP about 8 times over the last 3 years or so.  I’ve never made a ton of money but it used to be enough that I felt it was better than alternatives for getting rid of like-new clothing.  It was very easy.   The last couple times the payout has been worse and worse.  While the company has made hundreds of dollars off of my clothing, I made little more than $20.  As an example, I had a nice quality leather handbag that they charged $50 for.  I received $4 for this item.   Customer service is terrible.  I had to reach out several times when they had an item I sent mislabeled as a ladies’ top when it was actually a child’s top.   Terrible company.

I have tried once again a few months later and am not much happier.",3
669,"Great website/app: I love love love thredUP! No monthly subscription needed!! I love that I can pick the condition of clothing, handbags, etc. They have so many brands and are always posting new items for sale. It agrees that they let you have the item(s) in your cart for 24 hours as well as do bundle shopping, which gives you 1 week to work your way up to free shipping. Never have seen a website/app that does that which is an awesome feature. They offer once or even monthly goody boxes that a stylist creatures based off your previous orders as well as the questionnaire you fill out which is awesome! Only 1 thing I wished they had is a little bit men clothing(shoes and shirts would be awesome).",5
670,"My latest addiction: Every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to bed I check my favorite brands to see if new product has been posted. I love shopping this way, I find that by looking at the measurements of the garments I can determine whether they will fit me. The descriptions are very accurate and I have filled my closet with clothes that I love to wear.
I was able to clean out all of the clothes, shoes and handbags that I had purchased, wore once and never felt like wearing again.
When ever a box arrives I get great joy out of opening it and seeing my new things, wrapped neatly with love in tissue, like a gift from a friend.",5
671,"Great quality clothes: Huge selection of clothing and quality brand names, including premium and designer clothing. You can customize your searches by saving your sizes, so every time you open the app, you don’t have to re-enter this info. You can save items to a wish list, but can also “hold” up to 25 items in your shopping cart for up to 24 hours. I’ve loved everything I’ve ordered, even if a few didn’t fit and had to be returned. I do wish shipping was faster; it takes about a week to receive after placing your order. Processing of clean out bags is also slow, but so what, I would’ve just donated it locally anyway. All in all, I’m addicted. I gave 4 stars because of slower order processing and shipping.",4
672,"Great place to buy but DO NOT sell to them!: I was introduced to ThredUP as a buyer. I was so happy with my purchases that I thought I would try selling some of my own things that I no longer wanted. BIG MISTAKE! I sent my first bag off and was shocked when I received an email saying they had only excepted a few items and I would be paid $6.00! Really, $6.00 for top brands in excellent condition. Many pieces were barely worn and some still had the tags on them. I knew the pay out was low but come on! Unfortunately, I sent a second bag before I got the pay out notice for the first bag. I received an email for the second bag...$2.50!!! If I had known I would have chosen the option to have the unacceptable items returned to me and I would sell them to a local consignment shop. So, I guess I’ve learned my lesson regarding ThredUP and I will see never sell to them again. I hope this helps people to learn from my mistakes.",1
673,"SELLERS BEWARE!!: This company seriously scams sellers! Notice on all the seller reviews, the company never responds!🙄 I sent them 2 VERY LARGE bags of clothing and after my items were sold, I received $0! The reason? They “helped give my clothing a second chance”. The clothing I sent was all either brand new with tags still attached, or like new only worn twice at most. It was also all good brands such as Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Prana, Princess Polly, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, etc. The items of mine that they sold totaled over $260! I received $0. Not even $0.01 in store credit! You do not even get a single point to sell all of your items! Please tell me how this is not a total scam?!? Oh, and you get 24 hours to buy back your items they don’t post or sell for whatever they decide to charge you for them + shipping! I will donate locally in the future before I use this company ever again.",1
674,"Great potential, but so many bugs: I love that they have filters like inseam for pants, but these filters don’t actually do anything, you still see the same 1400 results that were there before. Good luck reviewing each listing manually. Same issue with filtering by jean style (Ex: flare, straight leg, etc)

Also they are the only retailer that doesn't use the names of actual product fits. You have to just look at the product photos (of which you only get 2) and guess as to how it will fit. At least resellers on eBay put the clothing article name in the listing. Ex: kimmie jeans by 7 for all mankind 

Also they still have an impressive selection of products but terrible customer service (response time of over a week) and it takes over a month for the actual items to reach you.",2
675,"I love thredUP!: I’ve now made 3 orders from thredUP.. I love the variety that they have and prices! The only thing I would improve and the reason I rated 4 and not 4 stars is there are some items that need more than only 2 photos so you can tell placement of brand or just a better view of the item. Even with that  I would definitely recommend shopping with them! This time around I will be returning a couple items so I’ll see how the return process works, but it seems simple enough. Oh yea an added bonus every item you purchase you accumulate points you can use for different things.. so it’s a win win!",5
676,"This is my favorite place to shop: I’ve been shopping ThredUp for a little over 5 years now.  I revamp my wardrobe every other year and I score $40-60 blouses (brands from a certain send-to-your-house-styling-service) for anywhere from $8-22, and that’s not taking into account their regular sales and promos. ThredUp also helps me take some style/color/material risks that I wouldn’t otherwise because of the prices (and option to return!). Once you’ve got your preferred brand and styles locked down, it’s SO EASY to shop. Even my 6-year-old knows how to browse and favorite things for herself on this app. I’ve never had any issue with quality or discrepancy—I love shopping here.",5
677,"Almost Awesome: I will say that I use THREDUP a lot. They have a good selection of very nice used clothes, the platform is easy to use and I haven’t had too much of an issue with shipping and customer service. 

The only things that I don’t like are the fact that I know some of the “estimated retail” prices are inflated so not everything is a good deal considering that this is used clothing that we’re talking about.  Second they don’t provide full shoulder, waist, and hip measurements for their items. The skirts only have length measurements. This makes it hard to determine if something is going to fit right since brands vary so much. Plus they charge a restocking fee if you return it because it doesn’t fit. 

They also don’t offer men’s clothing",4
678,"Good but needs improvement: It gets 3 stars because I LOVE ThredUp as an idea- but the app/ everything needs some serious quality improvements. The measurements for the items are completely off. The categories are off (just saw a long jumpsuit that was marked as a cocktail dress). I wish there were more photos for each item. Skirts don’t have a waist measurement listed (not sure I’d trust it, anyway, but still). You can’t select a category after selecting a brand- the category needs to be selected first otherwise it completely clears your other filters. It’s clunky, there’s a lot going on and it’s confusing to navigate. I still use it because I like being able to order used clothes online. Other online used clothes sites (ex. Posh) are good but ThredUp does the work for me.",3
679,"Great store. Just one suggestion.: Really like ThredUP. About 75% of my wardrobe Is from resale stores. It’s like a treasure hunt! ThredUP has quality items at very reasonable prices. Have been looking for a purse.  My only constructive criticism is it would be helpful if in the filters for purses there would be a selection for inner, outer pockets, organizer. It would also be helpful if there would be a photo of the inside pockets. I shop on eBay as well, and there is more detail like this which I really find helpful. Narrows down the choices, which I understand limits the product, however I don’t want to have to look through 1,000+ purses to find what I’m looking for.  That being said, I think the descriptions and photos of your clothing is really good!",4
680,"Help! Addicted to ThredUp: I hate shopping for just about anything - groceries, clothes, furniture, office supplies - you name it. But since I took advantage of that first new customer 50% off offer, I’ve been hooked on ThredUp. Doing creative searches and scrolling through the app photos has become my way to decompress during a worldwide pandemic! I love a bargain, and there is always one to be had on ThredUp if you pay attention. There have been a few items that didn’t fit as hoped, but I have been pleased with the vast majority of items ordered, and have received many more compliments recently. The problem now is not enough room in my closet!",5
681,"Review: I’m a faithful customer and always satisfied with my entire experience with this company. I only have had one issue that I just didn’t call about, it was really kind of funny when I thought about it. I placed and order and one of the items was A women’s size 7 Columbia winter boots they sent me a children’s size 7 🤣but I know it was an accident and we joked about how small they were then decided to find a child to give them to for Christmas, needed family chosen by our church, so that was a good thing. I tell people about this site all the time and I know a few that have already started ordering things. Thank you for your dedication to your customers!",5
682,"Addictive!: I love being able to choose from thousands of items and have a full 24 hours to commit to the finds I place in the cart while I decide what I really want/need.  I also LOVE that when someone lets go of an item in their cart I was interested in, thredUP lets me know so I can pick it up myself!  So many ways to find just what your looking for by brand, size, style clothing type, so easy to find what you need.  The only problem?  It’s addictive, you’ll have a whole new wardrobe in a matter of weeks, thankfully they have a payment plan 😱 - I am also glad they’ll consign the clothes in my closet that I just don’t wear which adds to my clothing budget! Win-win!",5
683,"Do Not! I repeat, DO NOT BUY HERE!: At first I thought thredUP was a great idea! Then I placed my first order! I paid expedited shipping to have my purchase arrive 2 weeks later! Then to top it off, each of my items cost $8.99 for return shipping + the $1.99 stocking fee for me to return them, but not all of my eligible items even showed up on the list of return options! Now I wait for a response to my email, which will most likely be AFTER the return period closes tomorrow! 
Oh, don’t forget to read their wonderful return policy (that’s all you can do too because this sham of a company doesn’t even have a actual customer service line) to verify that you should return the items in the condition the item was received (duh).Because, if someone at ThredUP decides you did not return them in the same condition...Poof NO Money refunded, NOR IS THE ITEM RETURNED!!!! Are you kidding me?! 
Best $220 spent to never waste my money here again!",1
684,"5 star shipping, 1 star everything else: There are unbelievably great buys on this site, but don't ever return anything. I've been waiting over a month for my return to be credited. Purchases have taken over two weeks to arrive. The items are always in like new shape. I read on another review that the sell clothes so cheap because they give the seller nothing, so only send clothes you would donate anyway. The RealReal isn't as cheap but items come quickly and returns are processed quickly. As for the app itself, I think it's good, but you need to know About the interminable slowness of the buying and return process. I will keep buying, but I will never return, and never consign.",5
685,"My Happy Place: I love ThredUp so much! I almost never shop retail anymore because of this app. I have found items here from brands I love that I never would have bought brand new because they were just too expensive. Here, I have found those same items for a fraction of the cost. I agree with some others reviews, however…I would like more photos of items which may have imperfections. Also, I find the measurements aren’t always consistent, and Euro sized items are usually placed in the wrong US size category. Other than that, this is my addiction. If you like thrifting at Goodwill, you will love this.",5
686,"Robbed: I recommended these to my sister after a long time of not using it, as an option for her to sell her clothes. Mind you all the items she sent to sell had tags or were never worn, most from Pink. She sent in so much stuff and only recieved like $10. I know it’s not meant to make a lot of money, but I at least expected more than that. That is a literal scam. They sold them for $35-$40 a piece and she recieved mere cents back from the items? I also sent in a bunch of clothes and only got $6…. I understand that they need to make their money too, but goodness you should advertise that your probably not gonna get anything and it’s better to see this as a donation than selling your clothes. Never using them again, I feel I was robbed and so did my sister. Will tell everyone around me as well that it’s not a good place to shop or send clothes to.",1
687,"Looong time thredUP customer!: I have been shopping with thredUP for over 3 years and I cannot speak highly enough of this company or the app! I RARELY EVER buy clothes or shoes retail anymore. Virtually everything you could possibly need or want can be found on thredUP at a fraction of the price and in great condition. And if I don't like what I've ordered, I simply put it back in the box and return it... No questions asked!

I have also used thredUP's Clean Out service multiple times. My closet is cleaner and I have store credit (instead of a payout--my choice). What could be better??! I recommend thredUP to all of my friends! You won't be sorry... GUARANTEED!!!",5
688,"Best app on my phone: This app has changed my life. I am insanely busy, a mom of 4 with a full time extremely successful career, while building a house ourselves that takes up most of our money. This app gives me more options and brands than I could ever see in a lifetime at the touch of my finger! I can bundle and buy over a week to get free shipping so I don’t lose out on items I want because I just don’t have more than 10 minutes here and there to look. ThredUp has changed my confidence, without breaking the bank. That blue polka dot box is a well known Mom Box around my place! No where else I’d ever shop like I do with ThredUp!",5
689,Amazing: I buy all my clothes on ThredUP and tell everyone about it - all my clothes come from ThredUP - shoes as well.  Just wish they didn’t change the app cus if an item in my favorites sold - I could tap on it and it would give me similar suggestions to that item - now it just says sold and I can’t tap to see similar styles of that sweater or boot or top or jacket.  I want that option back on the app for items sold cus I always found more that I wanted to buy cus - it narrowed the search if the item I had in my favorites had sold.  I’m a big fan and can’t believe how much I love all the dresses and amazing pieces I have bought - even bathing suits and coats and tanks and jeans and everything ♥️,4
690,"How do they measure?: I am looking for XL athletic racerback shirts.  Measurements are the only way you can know the true size.  The ThredUP app shows a picture of a shirt and a line across, pit to pit, w the label “chest”.  But there is no description of how they measure, like “pit to pit” or “around the shoulder blades and bust”.  So on several different XL shirts, all the same style and material, the”chest measurements are 46”, 30”, 24”, 36”, 39”, etc.  Okay, if you know how to measure, this isn’t even a reasonable range.  Either the sellers can NOT measure, or they are measuring w different units, or they are missing pit to pit and circumference measurements. 

And then, I will lose $1.99 PLUS shipping on every shirt I try that doesn’t fit.

AND AND there is no obvious way to contact the seller to get additional pictures taken.  Mercari is almost as bad, but you can contact the seller at least.",2
691,"It’s takes some learnin’: I’ve been a seller (mostly) and buyer on ThredUp for about a year now, and it’s been an overwhelmingly positive experience. 
Along the way; I’ve done my homework to figure out their system (as far as quality standards, processing items, etc), and it’s allowed me to continue selling amazing clothes without having to do the tedious parts that almost made me want to never sell anything. 
I would recommend ThredUP as a buyer; because I’ve personally snagged some amazing pieces at unbelievable prices; and if you keep an eye on sales and promotions, it can be comparable to any thrift store you might have locally. But overall; I would absolutely recommend it!",5
692,"Payment Made, Product not received: I have placed two separate orders in the last week.  The money has been taken out of my bank account, BUT the order was never placed in the system.   Under my orders the clothing is NOT there.    The 1st time this happened I didn’t catch until a week later, when placing my second order.    I checked to see if the first order shipped and it didn’t even show that I ordered, however, the money was taken out of my account.    Which brought me to my second order.....the same thing, took my money and nothing under my orders.   
If you could get someone to respond to emails, that would be nice too!",5
693,"I’ll never shop retail again!: This is, without a doubt, the best place to find current season styles, in great condition, at fabulous prices. It’s only February and I have my spring and summer wardrobe all ready to wear, for a tiny fraction of what I would have spent at retail stores. I have found all my favorite brands - J Crew, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, Talbots and more. Shipping is reasonable (if not free), and arrives fairly quickly depending on the shipping location. Everyone in my office is hooked, and we all look forward to the polka-dot packages arriving in our mailbox. Who needs the mall when you have thousands of choices at your finger tips that come right to your door?!? ThredUP, thanks for making shopping so easy!",5
694,"Love the clothes, needs to improve communication: I ordered several items for my first order and almost everything was in excellent condition except a pair of black wedge shoes I bought. They looked brand new but the sole separated from the rest of the left shoe the very first time I tried to wear them. I was able to return them without issue. Only problem is not once have they responded to my emails or online correspondence when I have a question. That part is a bit of a concern and could use improvement, but aside from that I really like the items I bought and have ordered more. The higher end brands they carry I believe are priced fairly. Thredup is a great option for those of us who are on a budget. Thank you!",4
695,"So slow, shipping and customer service: I can’t believe how long shipping takes. I ordered my clothes two weeks ago and I’m not even able to track the packages for some mystery reason. Who knows when they will show up.

Furthermore, when I originally placed the order some information was pulled incorrectly from my paypal (despite me having manually input it correctly into the app) and the result was that I needed a quick fix before it was shipped. I called, emailed and texted. I never heard back from anyone but eventually got a shipping confirmation showing the right information. Who knows if that reflects reality since I still don’t have even a single item that I ordered. As soon as I receive this order (assuming that I do) I’m deleting the app. Not worth such a hassle, so much wait and so little consideration to buy used clothes.",2
696,Thred It!: Love shopping for anything and everything! I can’t get enough! Easy to shop and easy to return if needed. Most of the things I find have tags still attached or are in perfect condition. I’ve been shopping on this site for years now and have only had a couple of things sent to me that weren’t up to par. But with the ease of the return options it’s easy to send things back you don’t like to get something you do like. Can’t say enough good things about this place! Only downside is if you send things in to be sold you don’t get that much for it even if it’s store credits. I still send things in and shop all the time so it’s not that big a deal lol!,5
697,"Not worth it: I’ve purchased approximately 15 items from the site. I returned about half of them because I just didn’t like them. Condition was fine. It’s very hard to get a true picture of the items when there is no description of the material and no photo to show how the item looks on a person.
I returned one because the condition was not acceptable.
And I should have returned two more because they were sweaters described as “like new“ but each had multiple “pulls“ that I spent entirely too much time fixing.
I’m very happy with the remaining items, but overall it has not been worth it. The concept is great! Returns are easy enough.
I think I’ll stick to shopping at my local thrift shop with real thrift shop prices and where I can see the true condition of my purchases.",3
698,Never again: The idea is a good one but application is a failure. You send in things for consignment and wind up having to buy them back if they don’t sell. The app can be a pain in the neck to use. Although I live many of the brands they sell. I cannot see longevity here. Somethings line reclaiming are poorly handled. You put things in your cart before I got a chance to talk to and show the kids what I was thinking of getting to make sure they’d wear them the cart was already empty. Forget it. You aren’t getting any more of my money. You have lost me. And check out my history up until this last mess I was giving you plenty of my hard earned money. But I am done.,5
699,"Buyer beware: Do not think that your NWT item will actually have tags when it arrives or your “might mistake it for brand new” item will arrive in pristine condition without stains, snags, holes etc. Also beware that customer support is sporadic and even though the company states in their ‘Polkadot Promise’ they will make it right if there is a problem - this does not always happen. These items do not have to to with the app but are a poor reflection. Some poor items with the app - if you sign out or the app kicks you out you will loose all your saved brands and other filters. When you message customer service your conversation deletes so there is no record on the customer end unless you screen shot. Now with the new ‘commit to buy’ feature you might have it available or not. You might get a notification that someone has committed to buy an item in your cart or not. The list goes on.",1
700,"Love Thread Up: Overall Thread Up is a great way to find clothes you love for less while helping the environment. I’ve gotten so many awesome clothing and accessory items. 
Suggestions for improvement would be more information about items. Such as belts: there is no info about the width in the description and it is unclear from the picture. Another is workout tops: does it have a shelf bra? And pants: I’ve received pants that are petite sized but that wasn’t mentioned. Stains: with no picture, I just skip it. 
More information would result in less returns and more sales.
Still, most of my items are keepers and I highly recommend.",5
701,"Loveeeee!: It is so much more sustainable and affordable to shop second-hand. There are so many good finds and you can find almost anything. The Goody Box feature is great, the returns, the clear outs, and almost everything is on sale or drops price!! (Which you get notifs on!) And don’t get me started on the rewards system omg I just kept adding things and my points covered the price. I do wish the names were a little more specific, like you can’t really find specific pieces unless you look for it. But it isn’t too bad considering you can filter almost everything. And recommended items and shopping peoples carts are fun features too. Overall- love it!",5
702,"Quality issues: The app is fine except no way to return damaged goods or goods that arrive not as described. I won’t be purchasing from ThredUp again.I’ve ordered twice, and both times there were items in the order that were completely not as described wrong size completely, damaged with holes when item described as in like new condition or mint, items that are completely unusable. Ordered a blazer that had a faux leather trim when I received the pleather trim was deteriorating and extremely sticky to the touch and completely unusable. I think thred up needs to have better accountability of its sellers so that they don’t try to pass off sub par and just plain old terrible items as like new. I know the prices are cheap,But at least describe them honestly and truthfully. Sticking me with an 8.99 fee when items were not as described is just a rip off.",1
703,"Great, but room for improvement: I love the ThredUP goody boxes, they’re amazing! I’ve gotten really high quality pieces for a great price. 
I have only ever purchased items via good boxes because the return policy for “normal” shopping is absolute garbage. When it comes to second-hand clothing, it is impossible for me to know whether I’ll like an item without touching it, trying it on, and seeing it in person. Also for each item there are only 2 pictures. So if I want to see certain details like pockets, zippers, logos, or patterns I’m out of luck. 
Overall, the concept of an online thrift store is great and I like the clothes I’ve gotten, but I need the return policy to be a lot more flexible.
Also the app is slow sometimes",4
704,"Really cool site!: I love looking through this website! I work at a high end women’s boutique and I love to be able to find clothes on this site that are the same brands we sell.  I do feel like the quality is exactly the way it’s described for each item.  I have only bought new with tags items or items in Iike new quality, and everything has been great.  I do feel like there are a few issues sometimes with the colors and sizes listed.  I ordered a jacket that was listed as a small, and it was actually an xs.  It barely fit.  and one time I ordered a shirt that was black and white stripes, and then it was actually navy.  Not a huge deal. Still love  the site!",5
705,Thred up goody boxes: I have only purchased through the goody boxes and I have had great finds. You pay $10 up front which goes toward anything you keep in the box and you get 10 items in your size. I have had 3 boxes so far and kept 2 or more items from each box at great prices and all the items I’ve been sent have been great quality! You let them know what you want to keep send back the rest in a prepaid envelope via ups and are charged for what you keep. Easy and awesome! If you do t like anything you are only out $10 which is less than you would pay in shipping and returns. I love this service and will continue using it!,5
706,Disappointed in lack of sizing info.: I have used several resale apps and although threadup has been my top one I am still pretty disappointed with the lack of details on items for sizing. They were great when I first started shopping on the app but recently I have clicked on items and I won’t even give it second thought bc sizing info isn’t there. That has been most every item I’ve looked at over the last 4-5 months. I am also disappointed in their pricing. They are rather expensive for used stuff. It’s hard to want to pay for a used item that I can go and buy at a store for the same amount if I watch for a sale especially considering how much they are making off the item compared to the person they “buy” it from. It’s a joke.,3
707,"New Favorite Place to Shop: I never write reviews for apps, but I am making an exception for this one. I absolutely love thread up. Everything I have ever received from them is high quality and might as well be brand new, but for very reasonable prices (something that no longer exists in retail stores in my opinion). There are endless options, you can search by designer, and best of all it actually is good for the environment. I even love that I have a place to send clothes that I rarely wore and take up space in my closet or that no longer fit me but are still in perfect condition. This app is genius, highly recommend.",5
708,"Sellers give away: My very first experience and my last. I sent in a very large box as a clean out worth way over $500 and ended up with a $5 credit when all was said and done. I had top name clothes, Pilcro, Paul green shoes etc. some of which I had never worn. I was unaware of the process and very concerned on how it all ended up. First off it took 2 months for the clothes to even get listed on the app. Way beyond the initial time frame promised. I had emailed the company concerned that the box got taken and got a canned response finding it very hard to communicate with anyone. I have never even purchased clothes from this site but I was referred by a friend who does l, so I thought I would give it a try, never again. I won’t even use the credit to purchase, they can donate it. So incredibly disappointed to the point that this has to be illegal.",1
709,"Quality and Customer service has really declined: I first started using thred up a few years ago, and was overall really impressed with the quality and variety of items available. Their customer service was incredibly responsive and helpful. However my last few orders I have experienced tons of problems: when I first purchased the items said they were eligible for return but by the time my order arrived it said final sale. I’ve had items completely missing from my order and no one is available on the chat despite them saying they had agents available. And overall I’ve noticed the quality of brands and items has really declined. Would not recommend ordering from them until these huge problems are resolved.",2
710,"WORTH EVERY PENNY!!: It’s awesome! I was super nervous, due to all the other apps I have used. I’ve done a goody box of favorites, did not disappoint. The coupons you get are so worth it!! Having the ability to find clothes that I like and love at my finger tips?! Yes please!! And customer service is great! I had to stop shopping because of how much I was spending! But there are still things I would like in my closet, wait til next paycheck! Better than stitch fix—high priced, Nadine west-  can’t get my size right, and other apps just too expensive. You decide when you want a goody box, you decide what you want. And barely get disappointed! Give it a try you’ll be thankful you did!",5
711,"It could be better: I’m all for secondhand shopping and when I find a seller that I really like I tend to stick to them. However, one major problem I’ve noticed with the app is that when you select the option to see all from seller, the app does not allow you to view the shop to its full capacity; thus, despite me knowing that the shop holds more items than the app allows me to view, I am unable to do so. This often leads me to go to the website on my laptop just to view the full shop. In that sense, the app becomes a bit more useless than the website itself and is far less convenient, defeating the purpose I assume it was created for 😑😤.",4
712,"Can’t give enough hearts: As a self employed photographer, I was worried when covid became a thing. I had the gastric bypass and lost 300 lbs so I had so many new clothes that I’ve been trying to find something to do with and not just toss away! Hundreds of dollars just gone?? So I tried ThreadUp and it was a life saver…literarily!! I was able to let go of so much and still feed my family and the deals I got on other great new or gently used items let me update my new wardrobe without breaking the bank! It’s important not to look like a slob when you’re promising that you can make others look gorgeous lol. Thank you ThreadUp!!! ♥️",5
713,"Unique Clothes at Affordable Prices: I really like purchasing items from this store.  For the most part they have items that are in good condition and are at affordable prices.  Their phone app is easy to use.  They also have coupon codes to give a discount and sometimes Free Shipping.  

The pros are:

-price can be great if item is in excellent/new condition 

-they can have good coupon codes and Free Shipping from time to time

-item is sent relatively quickly (usually within 5 days)

-they have unique items (especially if you want a unique, beautiful, trendy, and expensive looking style with items that may look as if you purchased them at an expensive LA or NY department store)

The cons are:

-there are only 2 pictures of the item

-there is very minimal description and very little measurement description (so you are taking a risky chance if you purchase an item that may require precise measurements such as; a leather jacket, etc.)

-having them sell your stuff on here is a waist (they end up getting all the profit with the customer getting 20% or less if it doesn’t sell and they keep the item!)",4
714,"Don’t waste your time: I would never do this again. First off, I requested the expedited bag, which is $16 (they either take it out of your your earnings, or you have to pay it afterwards if you don’t end up making anything). So after choosing expedited service, my bag took SIXTEEN DAYS to get to me. In what world is 2 weeks+ considered expedited shipping?! Because of that, I emailed them to request that the shipping charge be removed from my account as I didn’t think it was fair to charge someone that much for shipping that was clearly not expedited. That was a week ago and I still haven’t heard anything back from their customer service. Not sure what is going on over at that company, but it’s not at all user or customer friendly. They’re taking advantage of people who simply want to find an easy and reasonable solution to getting rid of clothes. I’d think twice before you use their service.",1
715,"Great Items, Customer Service is Lacking: I love the items ThredUP has to offer. I find items here (inexpensively) than I would anywhere else. I love the different box offers for a little surprise, too! 

The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 is because on all items, they say items will be shipped in 3-4 days, when they are actually shipped 10-16 days. Don’t be in a hurry for your items! 

Secondly, my sister signed up as a referral under my referral link, and when I contacted ThredUP to ask why my $10 credit wasn’t showing up, they said that my sister never signed up under me and didn’t sign up period, which is not accurate. So, that’s really crappy of them to not, at least, credit a measly $10 for their glitch. I had already spent a lot of money with them!",3
716,"Great clothes, great price!!: I just ordered for the second time; my first experience was awesome! So many compliments on the new clothes, and so glad not to have broken the bank on them. Don’t know if I’ll order clothes from anywhere else again :) 

Sometimes the pictures or filter markings aren’t entirely accurate though, so be careful. I bought a knee-length dress that was at least three inches above the knee (I’m 5’2...) So be a little weary if that kind of thing is super important to you. There’s only so much you can really tell from a photo. 

Also! Check all picture angles on the clothes before ordering. I almost ordered a cute (what I thought was work appropriate blouse) that I came to realize was backless right before... Whoops.",4
717,"Better off just giving your clothes away: I'm glad they are padding their pockets with the huge profits they make off of us.  BEWARE!! I have sent in two large bags with name brands like Victoria secret, Joes jeans, anthropologie brands and they average a 5-10% payout of what they sell it for.  Where's the other 90-95% going?  And on top of that you get charged a 6.99 processing fee!! I was in the negative with the last bag I sent.  What a waste!!  This place is a scam.  I would give it a zero rating if I could.  Better off going to platos closet or clothes mentor.  I have also bought several items from thred up that were advertised as ""might mistake them as brand new!"" .  That's great if it was true, but one pair of pants had a huge rip in the belt loop and my skin was exposed.  I'm so disappointed and hope this review will help people realize they have options other than these frauds.  Try selling on mercari or Poshmark too",1
718,"Went from awesome to terrible: I’m so disappointed in this company. I have been sending them clothes and buying from them for years. However in the last year their customer service has completely tanked. I have rewards points AND credits from items of mine that they sold that I can’t use. Their system shows that I owe them money, but they can’t tell me how much, when, or why. I disputed it and spent several weeks trying to figure out what was going on. Meanwhile I can’t even buy anything (or use my rewards or credits that I’m due). Customer service kept telling me to wait a few days for a response, and none ever came. This is borderline theft based on the agreement that if they sell my clothes I would have a small credit toward new clothes. It’s so sad to see such a cool concept turn into such a sham. Don’t trust this company.",1
719,"I Want to Love it, But…: To be fair, I’ve gotten a few items that arrived as advertised with correct sizing information and truthfully advertised wear and tear. However, too many items have been a huge disappointment for me to fully recommend this company. Handbags and Gina sale items can’t be returned. I bought a purse that was advertised as showing “light wear”, but in reality the finish on the leather was completely gummy in large areas. It looked worse than purses I’ve gotten at GoodWill, yet I paid a premium and can’t return it. Many of the clothing items I’ve ordered have been sized incorrectly. Yet, I have to pay $8.99 shipping plus $1.99 restocking fee to return them. So frustrating!
So, while it’s fun to shop for bargains on name brand items, it’s not always fun receiving what I’ve purchased.",2
720,"Shipping Process: I have been a customer of Thred Up since 2016 and very pleased with purchases, easy return and I once used the stylist option, pleased as well. The one negative is the shipping process. Initially orders would be received within 4-5 days, but lately it can take up to 2 weeks until you receive an order. It’s frustrating when you are counting on an item for an occasion and it has not been shipped. In addition, the credit process takes more time than it used to. For this reason, I give 4 vs. 5 stars. If shipping does not improve, I guess you just have to plan ahead.",5
721,"Great app!: I’ve been a loyal thredup customer for a few years now and have never needed customer support until recently. My experience working with both Monica and Ariel has been incredible! They were both efficient, friendly, and took care of my problems immediately! I’ve had an easy time whenever making a return, found items I specifically wanted that were no longer in stores, and a good seventy five percent of my wardrobe comes from this app! I was skeptical of an online thrift store at first and other similar apps have disappointed me but Thredup has consistently been wonderful!",5
722,"I LOVE THRED UP!: Honestly, I was skeptical at first but after making my first few purchases, my mind was changed for the better! All items except for two have been flawless/exactly as described. Also all items are pretty affordable plus I am able to navigate the app really well. So easy to love items and save items. Also discount codes and points work well. I also sent in several boxes of my own clothing! Kind of a win/win for everyone! I love love love this app!!!! I love what thred up stands for and I love the fact that they try to do as little packaging as possible/send everything together in one box. I can’t say enough great things about thred up!!!!! -Julia W.",5
723,"At Home Thrifting: I never thought I would be able to experience the thrill of thrifting in an online setting, but ThreadUp really delivers. There are always TONS of new items from a wide variety of brands, and they share as much info about each item as possible (condition, size, fabrics, etc). It makes for fun browsing, and the “bidding” feature and ability to see if an item is in someone else’s cart makes for an interesting, slightly competitive shopping experience. Sort of like a sample sale. I would highly recommend; ThreadUp delivers a unique at home shopping experience and bargain prices.",5
724,"Love this app!: I feel bad for people who give their clothes to it because I can’t imagine they get much for their clothing. But I get lovely name brand items that are seemingly brand new, and for a budding shopaholic this site is both a danger and a thrifty option. 
I always do my research to make sure that the product would be something I love before I buy it. Because at that point returning doesn’t sound like it’s worth it with the shipping and restocking fees. But the items that I’ve gotten are truly gems and the ones I don’t love I get to my local consignment store and continue the cycle! To anyone on the fence, this company has been lovely to me and I have no complaints.",5
725,"Fun to browse, many good finds: I have been on thred up for some time and have made several purchases. I enjoy scrolling through the app- the only one of its kind in which you can filter used items by brand, size, and quality. Overall would recommend. 
Things I don’t like so much:
I have noticed some items are over priced. I saw a dress I used to have many years ago posted- I paid $50 years ago, the app had it listed for $25... probably worth much less than that at an in person thrift store. 
You can’t filter out brands you don’t like, only filter in ones you do. So if you don’t like lula roe for example, you just have to scroll through them. You also can’t filter out materials.",4
726,"Not good for selling: I sent them my bag in early February, did not hear back for a while that they had received my bag till March. Then it was finally processed in April and they only accepted half of my items. I had sent winter shoes and pants that I was hoping to sell for higher prices but since it’s been processed till April, my pay out will maybe be only $6. Unless you have the patience to wait for this long process and receive minimal payback then just donate. I’m also upset bc I had sent some nice/like new leggings to them and they did not accept them. I don’t understand since some of their stuff on the website looks outdated and old. You have to pay for them to send you your stuff back. The process is too much of a hassle and I don’t recommend. I had read a similar review before and decided to try it, but NOT WORTH IT.",2
727,"-NOT WORTH IT- OVER PRICED-: I was so excited after hearing about ThredUP, and visiting their website. However after selling items on the site I realized how overpriced their markup was, and how little the seller on the site is compensated. Brand new items from my clean out bag weren’t accepted and from those that were My highest payout is .25 cents to their $10. While they accepted more from my clean out bag than they normally do my payout is going to be less than $10, had I purchased the insurance to receive any unpurchased/unaccepted items back I would’ve lost money. It’s a lose, lose situation. The suggested retail price for a pair of used jeans was more than the price I paid for them when they were brand new. I highly recommend doing your research on products on this site to make sure your not paying new price tag value for a used item. Shop local and save shipping costs!!",1
728,I’m obsessed: I love this app! I'm thrilled to be able to find wonderful one of a kind pieces. I get a lot of compliments on the clothes that I have purchased from ThredUP and they usually ask me where I purchased the items and I love telling them that it was purchased on ThredUP. I know that they won’t be able to go to the store and find the same clothing. I never run into someone who’s wearing the same thing as me and I love that more than I can put into words! I find it very convenient to shop from the comfort of my own home and saving the second hand clothing from possibly being discarded is wonderful as well:) I tell everyone that they should checkout ThredUP!,5
729,"Great for shopping, sucky for selling: The amazing designer and everyday fashion is endless and affordable, but if you’re expecting to sell, don’t hold your breath. ThredUP asks for up-to-date and weather/season relevant clothing but takes three months or more to process items so that they are no longer in season. If they ever get around to processing your items, you’re lucky to get a dollar or two even for in-demand items that are new with tags. :(  Is this a covid-times problem? It’s hard to tell. 3 months is a long time with zero communication and no way to reach customer service. Still waiting…",5
730,"No way to reach anyone: No phone numbers to contact anyone, there’s a “live chat” that spits out automated answers but no resolution. Then they ask you to send them an email and hope they will get back to you. I was basically harassed to do a “bundle order” which saves you shipping costs by waiting 3-6 days for them to send everything at once, the supposed perk is that during that waiting period, you can continue to add items and the total shipping cost is $8.99. For me, it’s been 8 days and counting and not one of the many items I ordered have been shipped. I sent them an email, have had no response and suddenly I see the $8.99 shipping fee has been redeposited into my bank account. Not sure if they are going to cancel my orders now or what, nobody is contacting me. Garbage app, going to delete it as soon as this gets squared away.",1
731,"Amazing! Just one suggestion: I love the app! It’s easy to navigate. You can search for either specific clothing pieces or brands, and there are plenty of filters to add to your search. You can also save items you like to come back to later.

On that note, I think it would be nice to be able to organize your saves into different lists. For example, I thrift clothes to wear but also to upcycle. And sometimes it’s annoying to look though saves of both kinds just to find one specific thing.

Now, I know nothing about coding so I have no idea how difficult this would be to include. Just an idea that I think would improve the experience.",4
732,"Great thrifting place, some interface improvements: Love and use this app a lot - great products at great prices to enjoy with good conscience, and a lot of fun in the search. 
The interface could have some improvements, my main pain points are: 
- categories of item filters - include some very detailed things like patterns, but not more basic sleeve length (for dresses, on the app) 
- emails with links to ThredUP - when clicking on links, no option to open on app, requiring to sign back in on web version / reset password (an issue mainly when getting a new clean out kit requiring printing) - file for printing could be accessed directly from app, or sent as attachment.",4
733,"Easy to use, always has sales: ThredUP always has sales and specials going on with good quality clothes for a fraction of the retail price!! I like to shop in their outlet section when I want to really save money. Their sizing can be a little off sometimes, but if you don’t buy final sale items, they can be returned. If you pay attention to the measurements and material and zoom into the picture, you’ll know exactly what you’re buying! I’ve bought work pants, wedding guest dresses, going out tops, and soon baby clothes. ThredUP really was a game changer for me and my wallet lol. Highly recommend for shopaholics on a budget",5
734,"No specs or details: Sure, they include basic information on a generic level. However, they don’t even take photos of all of the tagging and interior markings so that you can make a choice. For instance, if you’re looking for American Eagle jeans, you want to know if it’s high rise, super hi-rise, or highest rise. They just have “high rise” as an option. No photos of the interior stitching that would tell you. They also don’t tell you the fabric labeling. Yea, you have percentages, but if I’m looking for Dream Jean I’m trying to figure out way too much on my own. Finally, we can’t even see the year tag. That’s a HUGE tag for people wanting to buy used. And we just don’t get it. One photo of the front in a mannequin and one of the back. No close ups of wear or anything whatsoever. Frustrating. I’d use this if I could.",2
735,"The inspection team must be blind: The majority of my purchases have damage that isn’t disclosed! I have pretty much given up on buying anything white or light colored because there is always a stain! Today I received a white dress that was fine in the photos but when I pulled it out of the box it looked like someone had stepped on it and dragged it across a dirty floor! I have to do so many returns because there is so much damaged clothing listed as brand new! I learned quickly that you can’t even trust it if it’s new with tags. Then I return the items with the damage listed as my reason for returning, then I see the same item relisted for more money and still in the “like new” category! It’s infuriating. You must carefully inspect every single item because the “inspection team” obviously doesn’t. Oh and the measurements listed are never correct either",1
736,"The best: I am a firm believer in repurposing / rebuy / thrift / recycle and I also love new .... there are some things for every part of my soul in here. I received the first box and it came beautifully wrapped in a sturdy box. 
Everything was exactly as advertised. 
The order was sent in 2 boxes and arrived just as they said it would.  Everything fit nicely except one pair of pants needs a small hem because I am short.  ( my mistake for not checking the length ) 
Some are non returnable / some there is a small restocking . However I have not had to use that function. The  ladies in my circle will gladly take what I cannot use and either reimburse or count it as a “birthday gift early “ HAAHAHA.",5
737,"No stars!!!: If I can rate Thred up without giving any stars I would! I recently emailed customer support and received a notification regarding the bag I sent with items to sell. That bag was received last year November and until now March 2021 the bag was not processed. I reached out to customer support and they replied that unfortunately they lost the bag. They said they will compensate $308 for it, and determined the compensation because it is the average amount of all the items I sold. I am extremely upset because first of all if I didn’t email customer support no one will inform me about the lost bag. Second, that bag that I sent has items that are valued more than the $308 they are willing to compensate me! I am extremely upset and I felt I was robbed by this company! They admitted that they received the bag and it’s their fault they lost the bag so why do I have to deal with the consequences?! I felt like I got scammed!!!!",1
738,"Clean out box disappointment: I get that because of the pandemic, they’re working short staffed and all, but I sent my clean out package in over three whole months ago and have had maybe two emails about it! That’s an extremely long time to wait! Either hire more workers in a sister location, or limit the amount of clean out boxes you accept. I’ve been waiting so long now, over half the items I waited for are gone.  I’m extremely disappointed with how ThredUP has handled this.

Also, I’ve come across SO many items mislabeled! Sweaters that are obviously not sweaters, boots that aren’t boots at all, leggings marked as chinos? Some items I get are more difficult to define, but a lot of the things mislabeled by the ThredUP people are clearly wrong. It’s frustrating when you’re searching for leggings and have to sift through endless pages of “casual pants” to find anything resembling such.",1
739,Love it: I sell my unwanted items from my closet and the kids closet and I shop with what I make here. The only down side is it takes a while from the time they receive your items until you see your earnings but it beats items sitting in your closet gathering dust and not being worn. Be sure to send in in-season items only. This is really great for those who have really great quality items or high end used items who don’t have the time to sell and ship stuff on places like eBay. You won’t get as much as you would selling on eBay but here it’s no hassle and they do all the work for you so it’s easy and worry free. Love it! Happy thrifter here!!,5
740,"Great site: I’ve ordered a goody box & clean out bag & ive Recently placed 2 orders so far. It’s a good site to purchase from, but I have to say the goody box was Not to flattering. my only problem was out of the whole box I only purchased 2 items because they were exactly what I wanted. The other things in the box wasn’t my style and I stated that in the Quiz it gave me. Also I loved my 2 purchases I bought on Memorial weekend during the sale! I got Name brand Nike, Adidas, & Aeropostale all for about $50! They were in great shape, one of them being New. the clean out bag took a while to get here but I was patient. I wish they had more free shipping codes though. I would Recommend.",5
741,"Lost Money, Did Not Receive My Clothes: I purchased 5 items from ThreadUp, it was my first time using the site. Out of the 5 items, 1 item arrived rather quickly but looked nothing like the stock photos posted by ThreadUp. The item was a different color than what was shown online and it was sparkly, which I didn’t expect. The other 4 items apparently got lost in transit. I received a refund for the items over PayPal but not for the shipping, and I had to contact customer service just to find out what happened. The carrier said they never received the items from ThreadUp. So, in all, I’m still out for the cost of the sweater that I did receive but was poorly advertised (which I don’t like so I won’t wear) and the cost of shipping on 4 items I never received. I didn’t bother returning the sweater because I would have to pay return shipping myself and be subject to a restocking fee.",1
742,"ThredUP has changed: I previously used thredUP last year to sell 2 bags of clothes and got a pretty decent payout from them (~$250) when all was said and done. I recently just sent in a full bag with similar style clothes all in great condition ...not only did they not buy anything upfront but I only made pennies on my consignment sales! Not only did I only receive less than $10 for all of my sales but I had to wait over a month to cash out! ThredUP feeds you nonsense about using their “payoff calculator” prior to sending your clothes so you’re not “disappointed”. In reality they’re just counting on paying you the very least they can get away with while selling your clothes at inflated prices. The fact that they were once paying 15-40% payouts last year and now only 5% with my most recent bag is disgusting. I get they’re a business and need to make money but come on, 5% is criminal!",1
743,"Love the products and the goody boxes!: I immediately ordered a second goody box right after my first because I was so impressed with the contents! Great items, totally my style, some items with tags! Honestly, it nailed my style more than StitchFix has and they had less to go on. I recommend favoriting items so ThredUP can get an idea of your style.  I’m done with Stitchfix. The goody box has twice as many items, more time to return, and most importantly the price point is at least half that of items in StitchFix. 

I also ordered items I picked out and received those, and was so impressed. Average cost of my items were under $14 a piece! Three had new tags!",5
744,"Great way to shop!: I love shopping at Thredup to be sustainable, save money, and order from several of my fave brands in on place.  I’ve gotten the hang of the many filters, like condition and style, and they have frequent sales.  Curating each order is fun, and they’ve gotten great at shipping quickly with easy returns.  I’ve done several cleanout bags for items I would have donated, and it was nice to get a couple dollars for those.  This is not top dollar for your cleanout items, fyi, but it is super easy and they recycle what they don’t sell.  Been using for about 2 years, will continue buying from them!",5
745,"Good app: There are pros and cons to this app. I love the wide variety of items and amazing sales they have periodically. They have great shipping times and I do like the option to bundle items throughout the week. However, on multiple occasions they have a certain size on brand name items I have purchase and I have received the complete wrong size item. And I the size of the items where all clearly on the items. So then you have to sent me the items back and pay a restocking fee which I personally feel like should be saved since the company messed up and doesn’t know how to read the sizes or shipped the wrong size. Overall it’s a 50/50. Hopefully they can make  improvements in the future.",3
746,"I will never use this app again: You are better off selling your things on eBay or any of the other thrift sites. I sent them a bunch of clothes and shoes. Not only did it take them more than 4 months to put them in their intake but out of 7 bags and/or boxes, they only sold about 10 items. All of the things I sent were brand new that I never worn, I just didn’t need them anymore. On top of that, at first the clean out bags and labels were for free. After they started charging for both. And if they are not able to sell your stuff, you’d have to pay to get them back. I let them do whatever they wanted to do with them. I will never let them sell my stuff from them again or buy any of their items. They seem very iffy to me. I currently sell on other websites and I wish I knew about them before this company",1
747,"The Losing Side: I used to absolutely adore thread up until they made a change in the app that drastically brought everything to a screeching halt. Whenever they switched to this ridiculous points system, now you have to PAY for the clean out bags that used to be free, you get LESS CASH for your beautiful clothes, what was once-accepted IS turned away, ultra-STRICT on what they will resell, and after all that hard work someone dishes out for ThredUP, you are given points that EXPIRE after a short period of time. WHY??? I’m thinking maybe there are new owners that took over the company and they were sick o’ the old ways that shoppers/buyers went about on the application. What a shame. I am deleting this off my phone permanently, never again will I recommend this app to anyone. 
You’re better off with Goodwill or your local Thrift Store.",1
748,"My favorite online shopping site: This has become my favorite online shopping site, and it’s allowed me to buy the brands I like at prices I can afford. Many of the clothes I’ve bought off ThredUP appear brand new or only minimally used. If an item doesn’t work out, it’s easy to return it, and you earn points with each purchase that you can exchange for dollars off your next order or waiving restocking fees. I’ve expanded my wardrobe for both work and my personal life, and get compliments all the time for the stuff I’ve bought. I just can’t say enough good things about this site.",5
749,"Incorrect sizing: Even though I enjoy buying from this site, they have had a few incorrect sizes listed. I’ve purchased some lululemon shorts that were listed as size 6 but were actually a size 8 (twice this ha happened) when I received them. Also, I never received a pair of lululemon pants that I purchased and emailed about once I never received them. There was no communication from thredUP after the initial robo-email. I do use this site frequently and for the most part have been pleased with my purchases. Maybe the employees are just measuring wrong. Lululemon will usually have the size inside a pocket.",5
750,"Like it but some issues: Overall it's a great service. But the measurement are questionable, skirts have length bit not waist measurements so I will never buy a skirt from Thread Up. I also have bought a jacket described as looking like new, only to have a button missing, stains and sunbleached sleeves and missing stitching on the cuff. I am keeping the jacket for dog walking but lost trust that what will come is as described. I also receive a silk blouse that had sequins not detectable in photo or describe in item description. I wish they took a little more time in describing and measuring the clothes. But 80% of what I received was great and I really love.",5
751,"Addicted!: So easy, so fun! I’m utterly addicted!  I love the contest and all the fun little games and additions. I did my first goody box this month and I was pleasantly surprised at how well they pegged my style. 

The only thing I would improve on is more ways to narrow your search - okay they already have a ton of ways but I would love to see a shirt length and a boot height.  Another frustration on the app is in the search - when you choose shoes and then use the filter the categories should have things such as flats, boots, heels, etc - instead the just show you a list of the main categories (shirts, pants, etc). I think that might be an oversight that needs to be addressed.",5
752,"Poor form: I am extremely disappointed and I really feel that half of these reviews are fake. Often times what appears on the website is not what you get in the mail you get random things that look nothing like the item and when you try to return them they give you a hard time and say it’s not what they sent you and keep your money. They also give you a dollar if not less when you sell them a used item and then mark up the price by 80% or more. Often times clothing comes to you stained, faded, zipper broken or ripped. Their clothing prices are a bit ridiculous as you could probably buy the same items for brand new at the same cost without any defects. Proceed with caution I really feel the site has gone downhill as well as their customer support help ever since it became more popular.",1
753,"Love love love: I absolutely love Thredup. I have replaced my entire wardrobe with fashionable, designer clothing for next to nothing compared to what I would spend in a retail store, including discount stores. It is my favorite way to shop. The sales are incredible and everything I’ve purchased has been a quality item. I can’t comment on the return policies or features because I haven’t had a need to return anything I’ve ordered. From clothes and shoes, to handbags and accessories, I love everything I’ve purchased through ThredUp, and I feel great knowing I’m buying secondhand and reducing textile waste thus lowering my carbon footprint. Excellent buys while helping the environment? Yes, please.",5
754,"Like thredup but needs work: I sell mostly on thredup and they’ve lost several of my items and I’m still waiting to hear back on how they are going to refund me. They underprice a lot of items and it’s a lot of work to get the prices fixed. I wish they would get rid of the expedited shipping fees- it’s too expensive!  Some of my bags aren’t processed in the week time frame yet I’m paying expedited and they should waive the fees or cut them in half at least. 

I do like that I earn reward points on purchases and sending in bags! It would be nice to get free shipping off more often. Their prices are really good for shopping and I like the promotions that they run! Overall I like the app so far, but I’m new so we’ll see 😊",4
755,"Not Worth It: I’m all for saving money and finding good deals and cute clothes to wear. I shop on Romwe and come across better clothes than on this app. On this app the clothes aren’t even modeled properly and they all look old and wrinkly. They are selling clothes from way back who knows when. The style isn’t even in anymore. The whole presentation just looks terrible. Why would I want to spend $21 bucks on a shirt that, even though it’s made by Calvin Klein, looks like someone wore it a thousand times and looks like it belongs in a good will store sold for $5 bucks? For $21 bucks on Romwe I can buy a new really cute dress or a top that comes with a skirt. I can spend $6 for new shirts. Why should I buy from a clothing app that can’t even model the clothes they have. You are supposed to make people want to buy it. Not make them feel like they are getting hand me down clothes from a different era.",1
756,"Overall A Great App: I do love ThreadUp. I do not think that their original retail price is always accurate, the inventory is not always great quality ( in regards to being “in trend”, clean when it arrives, etc. ), and neither would I recommend sending in your items to revive a FAIR amount for credit. The app is sometimes faulty with a few of the functions and could use some work, but I still do find some great deals through the app. 
I enjoy the timer so it gives a chance for someone else to put an item in their cart and I love that by using the app you have 24hrs on that item, compared to using your laptop and you get only 12hrs.",5
757,"So so: Unique finds for decent price. Be sure to check actual measurements on everything, don’t trust the size in the listing title. Make your search terms a little more broad to accommodate that. 

About 1/2 of what I bought I ended up keeping, so the goody box is probably a cheaper way for a new wardrobe. Refunds were annoying. Never received a refund for returns until I actually asked customer service for it. Customer service never answers chat so expect to be emailing them in a few days.

 Also, selling items is a joke. I sent several new and expensive pieces and not a single one was accepted, but my ten year old fair condition target coat was? Something isn’t right with that. So just be careful with your purchases, and don’t bother selling, and you’ll be fine.",3
758,"Serious issue with customer support: Don’t send your good stuff to be sold on ThredUP.  I sent several of expensive long party gowns which were not wedding dresses, prom dresses, or bridesmaid dresses for them to post for sale. They never showed up on my account and my requests for customer service went unanswered for 5 days. They finally responded advising they don’t sell wedding, prom, or bridesmaid dresses. I have requested the items back, but fear they have already donated them. Now I will probably have to wait again another 5+ days to hear back from them, with news I probably don’t want to hear.
Update: just found out they donated my dresses. There were over $1500 in dresses sent to them. I am sick over it.  I was told that they only take 40% of items sent in to them, as if that is supposed to make any sense considering the items sent were new with tags, and in excellent condition.",1
759,"BEST PLACE TO GET GREAT CLOTHES!!: I have gotten more than 30 items from ThredUp now. Obviously, I love it! I’m a plus size woman, and I’ve always hated shopping in stores. ThredUp makes it super simple by giving you the measurements of each article of clothing. You can measure yourself, or order what size you normally buy and pay attention to what measurements you’re buying and fitting into for future reference. The returns are super easy - just print out a pre-paid label and stick it back in the box it came in and you get store credit. There are other options if you’d like your money back too. Overall, a 5-Star experience for me for each one of my transactions!!",5
760,"Addictive: With the new update, I can’t sort by newest or low to high cost, it’s telling I need to save the search. 

I’ve been a loyal costumer since 2019! 80% of my closet comes from ThreadUp.  My daughters are at that age where they can purchase their own clothes; however, I was told only 2 accounts can be associated with the same address due to promotions given to some accounts and not others. That is a problem because 1 daughter can’t purchase on her own items and there isn’t a way for her to share  clothing items with me that she wants. It’s not that easy to just find it by searching.",5
761,"ThredUP is FUN!: I love shopping with the ThredUP app. It’s so easy to navigate and makes shopping fun. I have loved almost every single item I’ve purchased here, and the few I didn’t love were easily returned. You can find pretty much anything you need at ThredUP — and some you didn’t know you needed — for a fraction of their retail price, and many are brand new! There are great deals to be had here, and I’ve personally snagged a few that were jaw dropping. They are great at reminding you about saved items or items you have in your cart, and checking out takes about 30 seconds. Check it out!",5
762,"I’d give zero stars if I could: The company and their practices are shady.  I should’ve read online about them before I bothered to send them nearly $400 worth of high quality name brand items that after months of waiting they gave me just under $11 for. Also they one jacket they sold under a designer name which didn’t match the label of the garment which leads me to believe they may be switching tags to her higher sell prices. There was an option to donate your earning to charity which I did because it wasn’t worth collecting. These types of stories are not uncommon. Unless you’re selling couture, it’s probably a waste of your time. 

The images on the site are lackluster and hard to make out how things look because they don’t use models or lay them flat. They hang them on illshaped mannequins. The whole thing feels like a grift.",1
763,"Obsessed!: Ive had such a positive experience so far with this company. I haven’t sold anything but I’ve definitely bought a lot! I’ve been really into thrifting lately for many reasons and they make it so easy to find used clothes. Searching for brands and styles, and the quality of the clothes I received feel like new. I’ve returned a few things due to not fitting right, and the return process was very easy. I’ve bought so many high name brand clothes that I would never dream of buying new due to the price, so I feel like I can finally afford fun brands. Honestly this company is so great, thank you!",5
764,"Will be deleting this app: I’ve done the clean out bag twice. The first time  I sent a ton of things, only 10 things sold and I made $9. A few years later in 2023 I did it again, this time with much nicer items, mostly American Eagle and Express, many many things still new with tags, and first they charge a $15 fee, which I figured I sent almost 15 pounds of clothes, I’d surely make more than that this time. Nope. This time I made $0. For a 15 pound bag of clothes of which only 7 or 8 things got listed on their site. And if I wanted them back it was a $6 shipping charge for each item. I contacted customer service to see if $0 was correct and they said yes it was. Unbelievable scam. Should have just brought them to Goodwill if I wanted to give them away. Not happy, deleting the app and never using or buying from here again.",1
765,"Do NOT use the Clean-Out Service: Buying clothes second hand is great. Love it. That being said. Don’t send your clothes to Thred Up, unless you don’t care about getting credit back / getting items stolen. I sent in multiple NWT items that I had never worn. Perfect condition. When they listed my items - NONE of the higher value items were ever listed. When I contacted them about it I got the absolute run-around; including but not limited to “you had items we don’t accept”. LIES. I sent them Torrid items, Shein items, and a couple purses. The stuff that was listed was all the lower value things I had sent. Total rip-off and shady practice. The payout system is also a scam. Got $1.47 after 7 of my items sold after they took their fees. DO NOT USE THE SERVICE Sure. Buy your 2nd hand items here. Don’t use the clean-out service though.",1
766,"No longer making money: Now you have to pay $15 for them to process your bage in a 3 month turn around time. Absolutely ridiculous! I used to love threadup but not so much anymore. Haven’t seen a penny of the actual sales put into my account. They claim you have control to set prices, but only after the bidding period and you have to hope they don’t decide to run a sale that your items fall into. Because they have gotten so far behind or have had more inventory coming in, have become much more picky on what they accept. 
My last few purchases have included absolute junk but it is better to just throw in the trash than to pay to return. Even after plugging in my size, the recommendations come up with items 2-3 sizes below what I wear. I bought a “cashmere”sweater but when it arrived it contained 1% cashmere.",1
767,"Used to be great, now not so much: This site used to be wonderful and recently, in the last few years it seems, they’ve started tacking on restocking fees that range in price depending on the item. The rewards are garbage and the pricing isn’t far from what you would pay for these clothes new. All of that aside, my biggest issue with ThredUP has been quality.

In my most recent order, four of the six tops I ordered had sizeable holes in them, and one had a weird flakey residue on the back of it. I’m still waiting for a response from customer support 🤷🏻‍♀️ but let me guess, they’re gonna swoop in with their form response of “please don’t hesitate to contact us” and “we look forward to helping you”. 

It’s really a bummer how far downhill this company has gone. Personally I’m going back to in-store thrifting and poshmark for secondhand goods.",1
768,"Downhill: I’ve been a ThredUP shopper for years, nearly since the beginning. The site has undergone a downward spiral in the last 2 years. Lately it’s even worse. It used to show you the most recent items first. Now you have to click through a filter to accomplish that. Until the last week or so when everything is scrambled and won’t filter correctly. “Newest first” isn’t clothes from 5 days ago at the top. 
Bags are taking months to process for only a credit of pennies. A tank of gas costs more than what I’ve gotten for a full bag of clothes. 
ThredUP needs to take a look at the mess they’ve made and go back to listening to and interacting with customers. I shouldn’t see Shein junk that costs more than it does on the Shein website. 
Please do better.",2
769,Love ThredUp: I have shopped ThredUP for a few years now and have found some of my favorite pieces for a fraction of the cost I’d pay at the stores. I find items that my favorite stores no longer sell too. Most everything looks almost brand new. I appreciate earning points to use for different things on future purchases. The only thing I wish is that the clothes didn’t smell heavily of scented laundry detergent. I appreciate that they are washed but those sensitive to scents might be put off because it’s hard to get the detergent/fabric softener scents out of the clothes. But overall I always recommend ThredUP!,5
770,"They fixed it!: UPDATE: it’s been fixed!!! So excited to use thred up for all my shopping again. ❤️

Why would you take away the most important filters? Skirt length, sleeve length, occasion, and others are GONE, making it impossible to find what you’re looking for. This makes no sense. Messaged customer service and they said they didn’t know when we’d have filters back. I use thred up for all my online shopping and love it, but if they don’t fix the filters I’ll probably never use it again. It’s just not worth all the extra time and effort it would take to find things.",5
771,"Easy Shopping!: The thing I most appreciate about this app is that - once you put your sizes in - it defaults to showing you items only in your size. YES. Don’t make me fall in love with a size 2 only to break my heart. Now I don’t have to watch sizes while I’m scrolling, I can relax and just flick through the racks (so to speak). Two suggestions, both on brand filters: 1. allow me to filter brands OUT. The amount of lularoe on the site is annoying. 2. Allow me to - like Zappos does - just scroll and select from the entire long list of brands you have available instead of making me guess in search. The suggested brands aren’t helpful at all.",5
772,"Used To Be Awesome, Now It Isn’t: I found ThredUp in 2017, and it was love at first order. I used to be able to find great deals on my favorite brands, and splurge on some items I wouldn’t otherwise buy. In the past 6 months to a year, I’ve noticed their retail price listings get really inflated, and their list prices are mostly unreasonable, even on sale. For example, I buy a lot of J.Crew, Madewell, Eileen Fisher, and Patagonia. I would have better luck going to those retailers’ websites and buying the items brand new for cheaper. I have seen J.Crew t-shirts selling for $50+ —are you kidding me?? I could get that on their website for under $20, and maybe cheaper if I went to their store at the outlet mall!

Also, I highly don’t recommend selling to them. For all the reasons other reviews have stated, I won’t rehash here. 

It’s been fun, ThredUp, but I’m out.",2
773,"Hit or miss: Some of the clothes come in great condition- others not so much. A white shirt that was supposed to be “like new” was yellowed with age. Another “like new” skirt had threads pulled out on the front. The bummer is that you have to spend $79 to get free shipping, otherwise it’s $6. Then you have to pay a $2 restocking fee to return these stained/damaged items, so you can easily be out $10 because of poor quality/descriptions.

UPDATE: They emailed me after my first order to see how I liked it. I let them know these issues and they refunded the shipping cost and also refunded those items to my original form of payment (usually you get charged a fee in order to do that). I did appreciate the prompt follow up from the customer service through email.",3
774,"Love thredUP!!!!!: I am almost addicted to this app!!!! 
I have made SEVERAL orders in the past few months and have been absolutely happy with each order!  I click on brands I like, or search brands I like.  I know my sizes pretty well so usually the clothes fit.   You have to read the notes about the clothes.  I tend to lean more towards the “almost brand new” items.  If there is no description about the item, I will not buy it.  The clothes usually come in a bag, ALWAYS wrapped in tissue paper. I had a few items that didn’t fit and you can send them back in a thredUP bag.  I love love love this company!!! Thank you!!!",5
775,"My only source for clothing now!: Last year, I lost 30 pounds. I was THRILLED but none of my clothes fit. A whole new wardrobe was not in the budget, especially not quality pieces that would last. Enter ThredUp! 

Unique pieces from well loved designers at all price points. Designer jeans for under $20? Totally. High end purse for 70% off? Check. Killer boots that I’ve been drooling over for a fraction of the original cost? You bet your tush. 

Their customer service can’t be beat. I’ve made mistakes when ordering, lost discount codes, made a second account by accident, and through it all their customer service has been patient, friendly, and helpful. 

The app has made my life so much easier. I can keep track of my orders, returns (uh, which are free if you take store credit which is amazing) as well as favorites.

Sometimes shipping takes a bit longer, but it’s totally worth the wait! The only thing I am missing in the app (and I may just be missing it) are the personalized recommendations that are available on the website.",5
776,"Absolute scam don’t waste your time: This app is an absolute scam and I cannot believe people are still using it. If you are thinking about selling things to these people don’t waste your time. I’ve sent brand new with tag Lilly Pulitzer dresses and was paid $8. NOT TO MENTION they do not send you a check with the money you’ve earned, they can only give you a visa gift card.... once things don’t sell you have to pay the shipping to get your items back AND the items that I received were not mine. I sent a pair of black Kate spade jeans size 0 (my size) and got back a pair of size 12 lucky brand jeans, they made no accommodation for their obvious mistake after I had to make SEVERAL contact attempts to the customer service department. If your looking to donate things send them here, otherwise take the extra 30 minutes and sell on another app things that are actually of value",1
777,"Love thred up but they need to change a couple things: I love thred up! I can find some cute clothes for decently cheap after using a coupon. Main thing that I HATE is that when someone adds something in their cart, they can hold it fit 24 HOURS! WAY TOO LONG! And then as soon as it rubs out they just add it again for another 24 HOURS! I’ve been waiting for a pair of jeans to become available for 3 days now. It should be 2 hours max, most websites are only 30 mins. Also I wish the shipping was quicker. I placed an order on 10/19 and didnt recieve it until 11/1. I’ve recieved packages from California to pa quicker then Arizona to pa. Overall like thred up but seriously need to change to 24 HOUR hold in your cart.",4
778,"Favorite place to shop with an app that delivers!: LOVE ThredUP and I actually primarily shop from their app. I’ll shop the website from time to time but scrolling through on the app is just so satisfying for some reason. The interface is very user friendly. I’ve never had it just shut off mid-action or purchase and seems to generally be a reliable app. They added the favorites option which is also nice as it helps you avoid losing something you like in the SEA of items available. 

No negatives experienced since downloading the app so if you love ThredUP (or are interested in seeing what they are about), the app is a great option.",5
779,"Love the product, hate the new browsing design: I tried to submit feedback in the app but wouldn’t let me. As a long time, loyal user whose spent a lot of money, I really don’t like the new browsing experience. Please bring back:
- showing the number of items that appear for a search. I don’t want to scroll without knowing how long it will be. 
- being able to swipe on the images while scrolling without being forced to click thru to the product page 
- also when you click “contact us” in the app, just takes you back to the homepage with no resolution. 
The new changes make the browsing experience a lot more clunky and less likely to stay in the app to purchase.",3
780,"Super App and Concept: A week doesn’t go by in our office where someone says, “Look what I got on Thred Up!”  It’s shoes, dresses, tops, belts, jackets, or bangles. We all love finding a deal on this app. It’s easy to search for color, sizes, favorites, and styles. Marking items as favorites let’s you go back and make decisions on which you want to purchase. The feature of being notified when item leaves someone else’s cart is an added bonus. It appears that people put the items in their cart just to hold on to it but then in 24 hours it goes back into rotation. The app is easy to navigate but the concept is awesome. Thrift shoe shopping at its best. We love a good find!!",5
781,"Great in theory: My only complaint is about accurate sizing to measurements on many items because I use thredup to look for certain pieces but it’s quite hard to find my size on there compared to other resell apps. 
When I try to filter in to show only my size, the top option shows my size, however when I click on the item’s measurements, it will say something that does not align with the initial size listing. For example, I click on pants that are listed as a size xsmall, I click on the measurements and it says the waist measures to be 29 inches long??? This happens with many different items which makes the app pretty useless for me.",4
782,"Why do I keep returning??: ThredUP has an excellent business model but the reality isn’t as great. I’ve placed many orders over the past few years and the description matches the product maybe...half the time? I only buy new with tags or excellent condition and I’ve received items with holes, runs, missing belts. Clothing listed as machine wash arrives dry clean only. So why do I stay in this unhealthy relationship? The selling process is super easy and the return policy makes it much easier to return for credit rather than pay to ship back. So I’m in a constant loop of credit, return, sell, more credit, and a 50% purchase success rate. ThredUP, please check your garments more carefully when you list them. You don’t have to post thousands of items an hour when half are listed incorrectly. 

Also...why does it take 8 months to process a bag these days? You’re killing me.",1
783,"Great finds: I love shopping on thredUP, I’m always finding styles that you can’t find in stores and there’s always a sale going on. Selling is easy, provided you don’t care about how much you’re getting for each piece. The pay is quite low but I don’t mind. On the contrary, they need to work on the quality of their items and the methods they use for measurements and presentation. So many items I have purchased had ripped seams, stains or the photo didn’t show certain details of the item, or the item doesn’t fit because the measurements were calculated incorrectly. No one is perfect, however, a little more inspection and consistency would be super helpful. Overall, I love shopping on this app!",4
784,"Hits & Misses: I have used ThredUP to Purchase and Purge items a few times now. My experience with the latter has been mostly positive albeit I don’t always agree with their assessment (ie brand new item describe as gently worn..how?). 

My experience purchasing however, has been a hit or miss with some of the items.  I’ve found that many of the items (some non-returnable) are not appropriately labeled.  Example:  I purchased a few skirts advertised as being: Large, midi-length.   Or knee length.  Upon receipt of the items.  It was clearly meant for a juvenile and was a mini-skirt at best. Perhaps providing the length of the skirt in inches/cm may prove helpful because midi, knee length, etc,. simply is not valid.  

I think if this can be improved upon my experience would definitely run parallel.",3
785,"Good but cannot tell if the item is lined or not...: So far I’ve been having good experiences with the website but I have 2 suggestions for improvement: 1) it would be great if you listed under item description if the item is lined or not. This would help on making decisions I only want lined dresses skirts and pants... but I cannot tell from your description of the item is lined.  2) 9f the size runs big or small in comparison to standard measurements. For example a size 4 of a brand may run larger than standards and a person that wears size 6 could possibly fit in a size 4 that runs large. 
With those two updates, the site would be five stars!",4
786,"This really works!: I am a new shopper to ThredUP, but it has been a great experience. My closet is cleaned out and now only contains clothes that I can wear. I sent back 2 items, and received my credit the very day they received my items. The system really works well. If one of my favorites is in another cart, I can click on auto-buy and purchase it if the other person has a change of heart. What a great idea. If one of my favorites is sold, they will show you similar items. ThredUP also takes your current purchase and accessorizes it...that is the kind of help I need! If you are not using ThredUP, start now. You will not be disappointed.",5
787,"Used to be great: I’ve been a long time fan of this company and have used them to buy and sell for at least 2 years. I have bought some amazing items them and have had some great customer service experiences. I didn’t start having problems until about a year ago. They drastically lowered their payout prices for clean out items, items I purchased arrived not as described (different condition, brand, size...), customer service became harder to get a hold of, and my packages have repeatedly gone missing (maybe more of a usps problem). Now they’ve also started charging restocking fees for each item returned under $50 stating it’s how they keep their prices low. Sadly, I decided to delete the app and stop using them altogether after basically having a problem with every order or clean out bag.",2
788,"No reason to buy full price ever again!: I was informed about the cite from a client of mine. At first I thought nothing of it, however, after seeing what amazing brands the cite had to offer along with the prices and on top of the sales they are always having I was blown away. I ordered 27 items my first time around and only spent $118! No joke! I waited to use my 40%! I only got 2 things I was not happy with. The secound time around I got 5 fashionable designer coats for $180! I am telling you I am now addicted and will forever be a dedicate customer! Thred Up is truly amazing! Not to mention they support women’s rights and education! I say give it a try you will not be sorry!",5
789,Dress shopping made easy: I have been browsing this site and that site and all over the web for cocktail dresses and couldn’t make a decision for myself and my daughter. Found thredup and decided to buy several from several designers all new with tags for a fraction of the cost of one dress that wether I liked or not I would have to wear it. The expedited shipping saved my a**!! I don’t have a lot of time to drive from mall to mall or city to city to find a dress and this was such a relief. I know one of the 7 or 8 I purchased will be perfect and the rest I’ll hang up for another occasion. Thank You Thredup!!!,5
790,"Love ThredUP  Hate FedEx: I LOVE Thread up. I have been shopping with them for about two years now.  I am spending the same amount of money on clothes I did before and now I’m wearing much higher quality clothes.  Also, I feel good about buying second hand as a little way to help protect the earth.  Also, returns could not be easier.
What I can’t stand is FedEx.  They NEVER deliver when they say they are going to.  Currently, I am waiting for a package that is 3 days late.  I don’t know if ThredUP has some sort of contract with FedEx but I liked it much better when they just used the United States Postal Service.",5
791,"Great concept!  Search function needs work.: I spend a lot of time on thread up for the deals, I love that part of it, however the search function leaves a bit to be desired. Need to be able to use more search terms rather than relying on the filters, which are also inadequate. Also need to categorize items better. I imagine a bunch of guys who normally work in IT pulling clothes out of packages and asking each other “what is this?  a cardigan?”  “No, I think it’s a bodysuit, dude.”  If somebody’s getting paid to categorize things you need to get somebody who knows a cardigan from a bodysuit.",5
792,"Great prices and customer service: I never leave reviews but I feel compelled to here. On Saturday night, I accidentally chose the wrong shipping option on an order, which would have cost me more money, and I wrote an email to thredUP about it. They got back to me less than 12 hours later (on a Sunday) and even though they could not cancel my order, they just refunded me for the shipping as a courtesy. Super impressed. Not only that, the prices great and the quality of the clothes they send is on point. And they made refunds super easy and cost effective. I am a very happy customer. Thank you thredUP!",5
793,"A thrifty shopper’s dream: I love ThreadUp! I haven’t purchased any clothes from a store in probably a year- I’m buying everything from ThreadUp. Not only is there so much to choose from, but I love that you can customize a search using filters, then save your search. There are often sales and promotional codes for things like free shipping. And I love the rewards program. I have had to return a couple things but returns are easy. Using the filters and checking the measurements definitely helps to cut down on the amount of returns. I highly recommend ThreadUp, especially if you’re like me and like to shop from the comfort of your own home!",5
794,"ThredUP is legit AMAZING 🤩: ThredUP has been such a lifesaver on my quest to create a more sustainable, ethical lifestyle. When Covid hit, my favorite thrift and vintage stores closed and I discovered this gem online! I tried out one of their goody boxes and was surprised with how accurately the stylist nailed my style. Also incredible customer service! I had 10 days to return my goody box but was unfortunately out of town. I emailed customer service and they completely understood! ThredUPs diligence and attention to detail in saying what even may slightly be damaged is phenomenal. Thank you ThredUP!! 
P.S. Ppl they have HIGH quality stuff that’s super discounted! At least download the apps and check it out 😉",5
795,"Best shopping app ever!: I absolutely love everything about this fabulous company! Such a breath of fresh air to have a sophisticated, trendy, chic online retailer of excellent quality items at bargain prices!! I’m hooked and love every shopping experience with ThredUp! I really appreciate the free shipping by using their app and allowing notifications. Super easy! Makes me want to shop more frequently. The return policy is very fair and helpful. I’ve never needed to use it, but it’s great to have that option. I really love that ThredUp has that mom-and-pop-shop feel, yet massive selection. This company is a winner all around!! Huge kudos to the founders for making such a wonderful company.",5
796,"App works great, tired of ThredUp’s SJW worldview: Did you know that Easter is one of the most widely-celebrated holidays in America? And 2 billion people around the globe celebrate as well?

And there’s no better time to sell cute clothes than during the Easter season, right?

Well, “woke,” socially “progressive” used clothing company  ThredUP COMPLETELY missed that opportunity and ignored Easter.

In fact, on Easter Sunday they sent me an email with...horoscope information!

So on the day of Christ’s resurrection, which celebrates the victory over the Kingdom of Darkness and hope and freedom for all mankind, ThredUP chose to slap all Christian customers in the face by promoting the false hope of astrology. 

Oh, it’s not that they don’t acknowledge other holidays. My inbox is full of Earth Day promotions right now. 

Gaia worship = OK, apparently.

Since there’s no avenue on their website for general feedback, I’m dropping this here, because I am not ok with their continued promotion of left wing, antichrist propaganda, and I want them to know it.

Yes, I am an actual customer who has purchased from them. 

And I’m praying for you if you read this far. 🙂🙏🏼❤️",4
797,"Items often mismarked: I’ve been using thredup for years and the concept is great. However, prices have gone up a lot in the last 2 years. My main complaint though, is that at least one item from my last 3 orders has either been mislabeled in some way (i.e. supposed to be “like new” but it’s in poor condition, or the size is not as advertised, etc). I contacted customer service days ago and have yet to receive a response.

Update: I received a request from customer service to send pictures and details. I did, and they haven’t written back all week. I also forwarded my email to the app’s customer service yesterday...still waiting on a response. Seems like this is a common problem and they need to hire more customer service agents.",2
798,"Unfortunate: I used to swear by this site! I loved it!  For all of my clothes selling needs and the great deals you can get on clothes, it’s my second time selling clothes with them and the first time went smoothly and I had no hiccups or troubles, the second time not so much. I sent them in, and half of them didn’t get accepted so I thought I would have them sent back to me like last time but I was told that’s not the case, unless I chose to have them sent back, I didn’t get that or see that option. I contacted customer care and the got back to me the next day saying unless I chose the “assurance” option it can’t be done. After a few back and forth messages the conclusion is even if you changed your mind or didn’t see the “assurance” option they throw your clothes on a heap of others and tell you they can’t be retrieved because they are hard to find.",1
799,"Hmmm: I love  thredUP and have found some awesome things on there but don’t always have the time to shop through the many items. I saw that you guys launched the goody boxes and was soooo excited because I can still love and enjoy thredUP without having to take so much time to sort through everything. BUT there’s no option for a plus size goody box. I’m in between straight sizes and plus sizes and it’s really frustrating that you’re offering a service that is not size inclusive. Especially since the way I heard about you are from plus sized influencers, like thriftthick and glitterandlazers. It’s really annoying to me that I can’t participate in this. For that reason, I will have to go through stitch fix or other companies like that. Really disappointing.",3
800,Great finds and service: I appreciate fashion and economy and Thred scores high marks on both! The app has terrific search capabilities and easy features for finding items I have previously removed from the cart or wish to save as favorites. The company’s policies for shoppers are smart and clear - items which are not final sale allow you to try on and return within a reasonable time frame. I have sent in my first clean out kit which will give me a sense of the consigner experience. I hope it is equally favorable so they can continue to attract sophisticated shoppers wishing to consign high quality items.,5
801,"Best place for unique, reasonably priced items: I’ve found such unique items on ThredUp. There’s something thrilling about thrifting special items. I also shopped here when I was pregnant. Maternity clothing is so outrageously expensive and going into resale shops is always a gamble. Being able to find cheap, quality maternity clothing was clutch. I’ve found casual, exercise, and special occasion clothing at reasonable prices. The app is user friendly. The only thing I would change is being able to filter out the level of discount you want to search for (20% off, 30% off, 40% off, etc.).",5
802,"Remove Lularoe: There are some minor issues that exist with ThreadUp that don’t really make it terrible. You might a an item with more wear than expected, I’ve gotten the wrong item on occasion or other little things that honestly aren’t a big deal if you are doing low-buying. 

Here is the the biggest problem and it’s big enough that I have stopped using ThreadUp for the most part. The amount of Lularoe inventory is preposterous. I’m not sure why they accept it. It’s an MLM with well documented incidents of predatory practices. The fact that I search and get a return of 1000 for skirts and 800 of them are probably Lularoe is insane. Stop accepting that stuff. If I wanted to be part of an MLM scheme I’d message that chick from high school.",3
803,"Filter Button Issue!: I’ve been using this app to sell for years, it’s been really great! I think that they’re organized and the process is simple and easy. I highly recommend it. I’m hoping to get the developers attention on one detail: I went in to shop for the first time today, and the filter button is located under the “back” arrow! Every time I wanted to adjust my filters, it sent me back to the menu! My phone, software, and app are all current- so nothing is outdated. It made my shopping experience super, super frustrating. If this one detail on the user interface were fixed, it would be five stars. Thank you!",4
804,"My go to place for shopping!: I’m hooked on this site.  Ever since Covid and the need to find something for my daughter’s wedding.  Yes, I needed a dress for the rehearsal dinner and with many stores not even open or if they were inventory was low.  I found ThredUP and found a “new with tags” Calvin Klein dress that was absolutely perfect for our Florida venue.  So, that was 2020 and I haven’t looked back!  They have so much to choose from and if you purchase and it doesn’t fit or you just don’t like it the returns are easy.  And this is such a smart way to help the planet! Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed",5
805,"Fun site: I have both ordered from and sold through them and never had a problem. I love how searchable (by brand, by NWT, etc) and sortable (available/unavailable) it is, and I visit every day! Some feedback on features that could be improved: - pictures only show a front and back view, which is generally fine for most but not all items. It may be impractical to change that. - when things are listed incorrectly (I have a blouse in my favorites listed as “short sleeved” which is clearly not) if there is a way to submit corrections I don’t see it. Overall great site!",5
806,"Love ThredUP: I have been really enjoying ThredUP as a way to lower my fashion footprint. Returns are easy and points are earned to help with free shipping, take away restocking fees and offer discounts. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I haven’t been able to reach customer service.

One suggestion I have for your company is to maybe expand your loyalty program to allowing patrons to trade in points earned for dollars: for example, offer $1 for every 100 points earned. It’d be nice to see larger discounts offered like department stores do... like back to school and holiday sales as well as have a clearance section.

Thank you for providing a place for people to responsibly recycle clothing.",4
807,"You might mistake it for brand new: I love shopping off of ThredUp. However, just beware with some items you do buy that says, “You might mistake it for brand new.” I bought a long sleeve having that description, “like brand new.” But once I received it, there was a a hidden tear in the seam near the cuffs, not that bad, but it was noticeable. I went back on their site and it did not mention anything about a, “bad seam” or “minor tear”. Instead it said,“You might mistake it for brand new.” Would’ve been nice if they were just honest about the tear, *unless* they “might” have “missed” it, trying to get it sold.",5
808,"My newest obsession: This app combines two of my greatest loves, looking for a lost treasure at a thrift/antique shop and getting a great deal. I love that you can filter for designer or luxe (I’m not sure what the difference is) and for condition. It is super satisfying to see how much money the item is estimated to have cost originally. I love that i can even see all the clothing I have liked even if it is unavailable or sold. It is also important to me to reduce my contribution to the massive amount of textile waste and this app allows me to engage in ways that reduces wasteful behaviors. The one thing that would improve my experience would be to create more default filter settings.",5
809,"Don’t send them anything!!!: Like others saying, this company used to be good, but they changed their return policy, and I feel like they ripped me off! My first bag was ok, when they emailed me asking what I want to do with the items not selected... I paid for shipping and got my unselected items back. I ordered my second bag a while ago, but meanwhile they changed the rules, you have to select the return assurance when ordering the bag, so my second bag I’m screwed and there’s no way of getting back my items... I sent in all my best stuff, about 50 items, they selected 9 and offering me $12 for them... this whole thing is a joke!!!! It’s not worth bothering with the bag for this kind of money, and what about the other 40 items???? They swallowed them! Giuseppe Zanotti Italian leather heels etc! They robbed me!!! Emailing back and forth, they sorry blah blah blah, and nothing.
Never using them again!!!!!",1
810,"Fashion for People Who Don’t Think They Can Do Fashion: I hate to get sappy in a review but I’m putting it out there: ThredUP has given me the confidence to start developing my personal style in my late 30s, long after I figured “fashion isn’t for me.” All the hardworking folks measuring thousands of clothes have made it possible for me to buy dozens of items that have fit BETTER than when I’ve shopped in person for myself. I’ll still miss the Goody Boxes (those were a SERIOUS bargain) but ThredUP is a win for the fashion-curious, the eco-conscious, and us old heads who miss thrifting but just don’t have the time to go on the hunt.",5
811,"Read the fine print: Be very careful and read the fine print. I didn’t. I lost a lot of weight and needed new clothes. It was the middle of winter and I have health issues so I thought this was the perfect answer. I boxed up a bunch of very good quality clothes, Talbots, Chico’s, J. Jill and  Duluth Trading Company. Fast forward five months and I finally have information about what they followed the items as. 1.46 I will get off brand new Duluth yoga pants. 3.80 off of a brand new J. Jill skirt. It took so long that I sold another box of clothes on Poshmark and I got $400 for the same box of clothes and I only was charged 20%. It was an expensive mistake. Hopefully they will send the clothes back. But I’m not holding my breath. I’ve bought clothes from them off EBay and didn’t have trouble but I wouldn’t honestly do business with them after this.",1
812,Love all the improvements!: I’ve been using Thredup for years even before they had an app and it just keeps getting better! I love that I can save my searches so I can check for new items every day and it only takes a few minutes...I can look at 100 sweaters in 5 minutes instead of 5 hours at the mall! I also love that I can search by fabric type since I’m moving toward more natural vs. synthetic fabrics. Bundling shipping and redeeming points makes it even easier and more affordable to shop! Returns are a snap and I can usually redeem points to waive the small fee.,5
813,"When it worked, it was great: Look I’ll never stop using ThredUp. The company is not the issue here. But this app, this app is just so unpredictable. When it works, it's perfectly fine, even better sometimes than the website but that's not why I preferred it; I used it because it was faster and more convenient and just easier to search than on the site. But suddenly it just wouldn't open! Just loading loading loading for minutes on end, till I would give up and go online instead. I’ve reinstalled it and updated it -- no difference. I don’t know what it is; my phone? But it's not worth it. Just use a browser. And hey, it could be a me problem. Give it a shot but just know that it might stop opening at some point.",2
814,"Sustainable and perfect during a pandemic!: I’m super strict with what we buy in our home and on sustainability. For years I have been thrifting and when the pandemic hit, this was the obvious place to turn to AND it’s way more direct and to the point than going into a thrift store. I feel like I find exactly what I want at the perfect price and save myself time, money and the risk of contracting covid 19 through ThredUP. I love love love this app and this company. Customer Service was amazing the one time I needed them because of a user error and they took such good care of me. I highly recommend!!  Thank you ThredUP for revolutionizing thrift shopping. You’re the real MVP!",5
815,"Chat with customer service doesn’t work: I love thread up and have been using the app for two years. Recently there is no way to contact customer service. There is an ability to “chat” however the app keeps asking me to login even when I’m logged in. I deleted the app and tried again numerous times. The only phone number to contact someone is the persons with disabilities line. They stated in the message unless it’s a issue for someone with a disability they won’t call back. 

The whole reason I wanted to contact customer service was my order is taking a very long time to ship. I made two orders. One was a bundle order that I ordered on the 12th of august, and the other was not a bundle I ordered on the 16th. Today is the 23rd. Neither order was shipped today. Very disappointed with the whole ordeal.",1
816,"Observation: Who is determining what dress length is knee length and what dress is not?  How can a dress 31 inches in length and a dress 41 inches in length BOTH be considered knee length. If you know the designers you can pretty much figure out how a dress will fit on you or if you’re a sewer you can look at a dress and maybe figure out how where the hem will hit but, we rely on you to give us an honest assessment of the clothing,  I’d like to know based on average height (and be told the height your using) where the dress will hit, above the knee, at the knee, below the knee.  There is no such thing as knee length and short unless you consider a hem that falls at your knee short!",5
817,"Understaffed & Poor Customer Service: I sent 3 HUGE closet clean out bags full of expensive designer clothing & shoes in July. It’s now basically December and they still have not processed my clean out kits. I inquired about the bags 2 months ago and they gave me some BS about Covid. Seems like every company is using Covid as an excuse to deliver poor customer service these days & there’s no excuse for it. Now, my fabulous items are missing out on being sold for Black Friday and the holiday season. A good amount is winter goods! No one is going to buy that stuff in February when ThredUP finally gets around to processing my bags, so they are costing me $ on my items. First and last time I trust ThredUP with my reselling. And I have bought many things from them, but now I’m just entirely soured on the company and will no longer be using them or recommending them to others. I am using PoshMark going forward.",1
818,"A Good Experience: Pros: the buying experience is mostly excellent. The ThredUP team have created a standard which I have now come to trust. Mostly. Every once in a while a deviation will slip through however they have a return policy. 

Cons: the return takes way too long. While they are checking the returned items back in, my money is tied up for weeks. It is unfair and too blocks me from trying more clothes. They need to staff their return process and have that portion of the business be faster. 

Recommendation for upgrade: while the app experience is mostly excellent, one area that is lacking would be able to sort your favourites which you cannot do at present.",4
819,"Is really fun: I really enjoy shopping online and thredUP does a great job of making it fun. The search system is good but could be improved. For example, under neckline almost everything is covered except collars. When looking for shirts to wear with my wool jackets, I need collars and there isn’t any way to look for that. Also, it would be nice to be able to save a list of eliminated brands rather than try to click on all the brands I do want to see. How great to say, never show me H&M or Merona. People entering item details sometimes get confused or just get it wrong saying a sweatshirt is a sweater, a dress is a shirt, which make it difficult/annoying. 4 stars means it has my attention but could be better.",4
820,"Love shopping on ThredUp: I recently discovered ThredUp and it quickly became my go-to site for shopping for ""recycled"" clothes. The app is easy to navigate and fun to browse, great search functionality, and I have been very happy with my purchases. Prices are on par with my local consignment shop, quite reasonable. Have had to return a few things (mostly for fit) and the process to return for store credit has been quick and easy. My only suggestion would be to list the length on necklaces. I have not yet bought jewelry on ThredUp for that reason. Add that feature and this will be the perfect platform to shop for used clothes!",5
821,"So far so good: I have gotten some good deals. The items that I purchased were well packaged. My biggest complaint so far is that it seems to take a VERY long time for items to reach you (especially compared to the other selling apps). I did have to return some of the items that I purchased and that seemed to go quite smoothly- but beware of restocking fees. Quite a few items do seem poorly measured. Once I ordered an item that I thought was a ladies size 10, but ended up being a kids sz 10. Another downfall is, something may be listed as having a minor stain or wear, but there isn’t a clear picture of the issue, so you are essentially in the dark. Some things do seem to be over priced but they do offer some good sales.",3
822,"Muh just pass: From the selling side. I would advise to pass. I understand that they are a business to make a profit so it’s not like your going to make a gold mind when selling your clothes. What I didn’t like is that they mislabeled some of my items to sell. For example, for a shirt that was light pink and short sleeved they posted a picture of a long sleeved green shirt, they labeled some shirts as dresses and got necklines wrong. I couldn’t find where to contact anyone though the app and you can’t edit the description. I also found it surprising to what they didn’t take vs what they did. For example, I wore a black tie maternity dress once to a wedding not excepted, but the took an item with tags that had fraying. Their clean out boxes says to send items you’d give to a friend, my advice just give it to a friend or give local. You won’t end up with a sour taste in your mouth that way.",1
823,"I would give 0 if I could: DO NOT use the site thredUP to buy or sell your used items. I had some old designer items I wanted to get rid of and they had recently been popping up on my feed, I decided to give them a try. I even paid $10 for a return service if they didn’t want any items to send them back to me but they didn’t give me the option of returning any items if I didn’t think the price they were offering wasn’t fair. I sent them a large bag filled with great condition name brand clothing and shoes some still with tags on them, that they are now selling on their site and they gave me literally pennies on the Dollar. I got a check for $30 and if they sell all my items they will be getting $320. I will not be using them again or buying anything from them if they are screwing over the people that are providing them their products.",1
824,"Love Love Love ThredUP!!: I have always had the most difficult time shopping for clothes that feel like me; especially the last few years, having struggled to lose baby weight and being a 5’3 gal, I’ve had an even harder time finding clothes that make me feel good. This app works swimmingly as well! I love that you can upload a photo of an outfit you like and it’ll search for similar clothes too!! I’ve ordered once so far, and I couldn’t believe the great condition the clothes I bought for such a steal were in!! I’ve been telling everyone about ThredUp, you won’t regret it!",5
825,"First place for unique finds: I have been using this app for 10 years now. I’ve seen it grow and expand with new warehouses. I always come to this app to look for brands I love at discounted prices.  The app itself is easy to use and I love how you can do a 180 view without clicking into the item. Shipping is now even faster than before. Their rewards program makes it very easy to earn points towards your reward tiers, not to mention the rewards are actually worth it.  I always recommend this app to people I meet. I can’t say enough great things about it!!!! 🙌🏼",5
826,"Pretty Awesome: I used ThredUP for buying brands that are more expensive in the store. I’ve gotten some of my closet staples from ThredUP and some of my favorite pieces. However things don’t always look the same on my body as they did in the pictures, there’s always a couple things from my order I can’t use. But everything else is great and that’s just how online shopping goes anyway. I’ve learned to really pay attention to to the measurements which they provide and compare them with my own. It’s really fun hunting for items, like at the thrift store but from my couch!",5
827,"Room for improvement: Cons:When you purchase an item by the time the site is updated with the tracking information your package arrives at your house. With the holidays and porch pirates it would be nice to have the tracking information be reflected so you can grab your purchase before it’s stolen by a porch pirate. The items are NEVER categorized right for the condition they are in. I only buy new because the like new items are not checked right for the light signs of wear. I consistently would buy “like new” and a stain is right in the middle, or a button is missing or the seams are unraveling. I always have to fix the clothing from them. 
Pro: a good selection no matter what the season is.",3
828,"Love this company: Keeping clothes out of landfills since 2008. I am a thrifter, and I love this app. All the fun of never knowing what unique piece you might stumble on, but on the go! I love the feature where you can tailor your sizes , your style preferences, brands you like, etc. Filters my searches quickly and guarantees that I’ll see so many more items that appeal to me! Love the app. I’ve done the clean out kits too, it’s simple enough. Just takes a bit to see some turn around. You have to be on top of it, and send things in EARLY in the season to make sure they sell! It’s nice having the bit of extra cash to shop around with!",5
829,"Description incorrect!: The things I think the site needs to improve are: •the accuracy of the description of the items, some clothing I bought says “you might mistake it for brand new” but the item I received is obviously worn multiple times 🤦🏻‍♀️. •provide more actual & clear pictures of the item, not just front & back (misleading most of the time). •No customer service, you have the option though if you have concerns just that nobody will get back to you. •returning an item because the description on the site is misleading, is not an easy option. I guess, I’m done with this thred up thing, so much with helping save the earth when you end up getting tricked.",3
830,"ThredUP needs better pics: I enjoy using ThredUP, the concept allows you try different brands you may not normally have access to and the app is easy enough to use but I think it would be helpful to explain what flawed gem is and also say what the flaw is, maybe show a close up, also explain what the terms final sale mean, why are some things final sale?, I think it would also help if better pictures, of the actual item would be helpful. I go through phases of buying and selling but not being able to check things out or get an accurate description is what makes me apprehensive sometimes.",4
831,"Wrong measurements advertised: Please tell me who you guys hire to measure you clothes?? 😂They are wrong every time. I’ve ordered 5 different clothing items and only 1 had correct measurements. I know this because I work as a seamstress. They are measuring the inseam , waist everything wrong & are way off by like SEVERAL inches. It’s such a shame too because if the measurements were correct, I would order from thred up constantly because they have quality clothes for cheap but that means nothing if they send you the wrong size. At this point if I order anything it’s more of a gamble because it’s like a 50/50 chance I will get the correct size. Please fix this & hire people who actually know how to correctly measure because your store has so much potential!!",2
832,"Nothing compares: First of all thredUP has unbeatable prices and anyone can join in on the fun. I personally at first didn’t vibe too well but then when I understood how it works it began to grow on me. People get mad because of payouts but think of all the work that goes into sending, listing, waiting to sell, shipping & all that Jazz. If one wants maximum cash they should sell on their own haha but I love it because as a reseller it gives me a chance to get great deals and raise the value of the items I can connect to sellers!! It feels like we are a big family helping each other out!! Not to mention sustainable!! Wow I just am in love with you thredUP!!",5
833,"Don’t like the app experience: I was already aware of the low payouts, but until it happens to you, you don’t realize how bad they are. When people say they got 39 cents for a $50 item, believe them! My complaint is the app itself. You can grow old and gray before you find details about a return or a bag you sent in. I’m pretty savvy with technology and do a lot of online shopping, and think everything should be right at your fingertips in an app. With ThredUp I have to go back and cross-reference my email if I want any information. It’s easy to buy stuff (hence the 2 stars), but it’s rough on a seller or if you have any returns.",5
834,"Buying is great but not selling: I love finding cute clothes that are under $10. They have a lot of stuff but if you like a particular item, you’ll want to buy it right away because there is no guarantee it will still be there. The biggest problem I had was selling my clothes. I had plenty of really nice items that I had even gotten from them that I put in their bag. I had tons of really nice baby clothes and only three of the baby clothes were picked to be sold. They even broke up sets of clothes. They have an option to get the clothes back but we were moving so it made no sense to have everything sent back to our old address. So buy what you want but you’re not gonna get anything from selling your clothes.",3
835,"Great to buy from! But ONLY to buy!: I love a good treasure hunt & this is definitely one at its finest! I’ve made some great purchases for both me and my daughter, too. BUT, do not use their Clean-Out service if you’re expecting to make more than a couple cents. I’ve sent in bags loaded with Lularoe, Gap, Old Navy, LOFT, etc. and gotten at the most $1.60 back per item. I’ve followed all of their directions: freshly laundered, no rips, stains, holes, etc. 
For example, brand new Lularoe Joy (with tags still attached) retails at $55; they are giving me 40 cents! Just definitely not worth your time & especially since it takes about 2 months for your bag to be processed. Also, if you purchase from them, be prepared to wait a bit (at least 2 weeks) to get anything. Just my two cents though. 

Happy Shopping (or not)!",2
836,"Poor Customer Service, Don’t Sell Here: I’ve appreciated the concept of buying second hand. The app is very user friendly and provides an overall fantastic buyer experience. As a buyer you can find good deals.

SELLER BEWARE: As a seller, they have lost incredibly expensive items I have sent (new with tags brand name leather purse on their LUXE sales and other clothing), and their customer service has been unsympathetic on the issue while they have failed to properly find the items or compensate me on items that were supposed to be returned to me if not sold. I first sent a few bags of average clothing which sold and I received a minimal consignment, which I expected; however, once I sent in nicer items many were lost. he whole situation seems suspect, or operational error and poor customer service at best.",2
837,"The Best Thrift Ever: I love ThredUP, I use to thrift my local thrift stores but I can’t anymore due to health issues and most thrift stores don’t have any amenities to help  if you have a disability and some are a hazard to move around in. ThredUP gave me my freedom to still enjoy the thrill of the hunt to find the pieces I love. There are only 2 things I would like to see and that is the true measurements for all belts instead of the generic measurements s-m-L etc and info on rather a handbag or tote has a zipper or snap/ magnetic closure and how many pockets or just a pic of the top or inside of bag. 
Other than that everything is great.",5
838,"Best way to promote circular fashion!: I’ve been shopping with ThredUP for a few years now, the entire experience is so easy. I have always loved to bargain shop so I love saving a search for brand names that last a long time and enjoying the clothes for another life. I love trying to favorite a lot of clothes to get ready for upcoming sales that there are on the app. The developers continue to add lots of new features and updates so that it continues to be an easy experience. It is so easy to get that new outfit feeling at a fraction of the price while benefitting the environment by buying on ThredUp!",5
839,"Do not sell to this company!: I am so disappointed in my experience with ThredUP I don’t even know where to start.  To date, I have received $3.67.  Unbelievable. I sent items in that were like new and two years old or less. Two pairs of Marc Jacob boots, 3 pairs of Coach shoes, Zara dresses, multiple pieces from the Gap and Banana Republic, Madwell, and Free People, a Vince dress, and more.  $3.68? What a joke. ThredUP I hope you can sleep at night knowing that you are ripping people off. What a horrible experience.  If I sold local I would have left with at the minimum $200+.  False advertising and a lack of integrity sums up ThredUP.  I will never use this company again.  Do not sell to this company! 
Who are you donating the products you don’t accept and that don’t sell?
ThredUP I have submitted a complaint to the Attorney General for fraud.  You need to make complaints by your customers right.",1
840,"Best site to add to your wardrobe without breaking the bank!: I’ve been wanting to completely revamp my closet but couldn’t imagine spending hundreds of dollars at retail stores, and then I found thred up. There’s sooo many options that are SUPER affordable and everything is so nice and in great condition. This is honestly where all my clothes will probably come from from now on because why spend $20 on a shirt I can find when on here i can probably find one just as good if not nicer for less than $10. Plus, I like that shipping is a decent flat rate and I’ve received all my orders super quickly as well!  Definitely recommend!",5
841,Awesome deals!: I love buying name brands clothes from this site.  Often time I’ll find new clothes with tags sold at a huge discounted price. Love the fact you can return the clothes for a small fee.  If I like half the items I bought it’s still a win. My recommendation is to buy items and brands you know will look good on you.  Please note the site will have  different sellers list the same item in the same size at different prices so be on the look out.  Regarding selling only send items you don’t mind losing or giving to goodwill. The payout is not huge. High ticket items sell yourself unless you are super lazy.,5
842,Frequent shopper: I’m in love with thred up! I have found some of the best deals on this website. Anything from casual tops to designer evening wear. I have used it for everything. I have sent back items that haven’t fit and have gotten my refunds after a reasonable processing time. I contacted them once through email about sending in shoes for selling and my email was answered within 24 hours. I recommend this site to everyone that compliments the clothes I’m wearing. My husband recently asked when my “obsession with thred up” was going to end. I have no answer for that. Thanks for making couch shopping so interesting and enjoyable!,5
843,"I have to disagree ...: I have to disagree with the person who said ThredUp has “atrocious customer service.”  I made a purchase of a pair of workout shorts and put them in washer and dryer per the tag’s instructions. The pocket came undone. I wrote CS multiple times in an effort to get my money back. I included pictures of the damage. Customer service never responded. Fast forward one year later and I’m still holding onto the shorts. I tried one more time in a last ditch effort and I get a response from this fantastic person who not only finds my account but issues me a full refund! I couldn’t be more pleased. Grated, they should be more easily accessible but they have incredibly high turnover and are high volume, low budget. You get what you pay for.",3
844,"Amazing finds - new with tags: I have found the Gold Mind for fashion. I live in central Florida where you have to drive over two hours to find a really nice mall with upscale clothing. Yes, the internet exists and I can order online, yet the types of clothes I enjoy wearing are usually boutique, which sell out fast online. Shopping on ThredUp. I can find my boutique clothes and accessories, new with tags, at such a lower cost. My friends love my style and the fact that they cannot find my clothes at regular stores. I introduced them all to ThredUp and they all love shopping on ThredUp too. They have a simple return process for store credit or full refund.",5
845,"Great shopping experience: I have always enjoyed shopping at ThredUP. I now mainly purchase secondhand clothing. I can easily afford to purchase brand new but believe it is best for the planet to do my part and buy something already made, but not enjoyed by someone else. I have sent in my slightly used clothing to ThredUP and found that process rewarding as well. I congratulate this company on its adventure in helping all of us enjoy a shopping experience, get exciting new clothes, help the environment, help the disadvantaged and make us all feel good when the box with the green polka dots arrives. Well done!",5
846,"Excellent!: First off, the customer service is great. All you have to do is send a simple text with your question, and they get back to you in a timely manner and are completely respectable. Second, they have great options and many different sizes to choose from. Me being plus size, it's really hard to shop, but this app has so many options for everyone, even the plus size people and I love that! ❤️ the new update that lets you ❤️ your favorite clothes instead of only being able to add them to your cart and then be deleted the next is day is great! Excellent job ThredUP You have a lifelong customer for sure! 👍🏻

*Edit: this a great place to buy from, but don’t don’t sell to them. They will rip you off. Simple as that.",3
847,"Clean outs: I’m not thrilled with how little they chose and supposedly they got rid of brand new with tags women’s Levi’s, which just one of the new items they passed on. Out of two large bags they chose 5 items from each bag and when you add up the payouts they will just about cover the money owed for shipping. So I will not make any shopping credit and may end up owing money if all my items don’t sell. ( so far 5 of 10 have sold and that was the first day, nothing since), it was worth giving it a shot but I might as well have taken the stuff to goodwill and gotten a tax right off instead of owing for shipping. But that’s just my experience. I’m sure others would disagree.",3
848,"I absolutely love threup!!: Im only 14 years old. Im a girl who is obsessed with thrifting because it helps the planet reduce waste. And because you will never know what you will find!!! I remember always looking at these fast fashion online stores. I even remember spending so so much money on fast fashion websites, to only get products that don't even last!!!! My parents are very protective and they do not like when I go out, so finding thredup saved me. It was life changing finding an online thrift store that has such amazing affordable items. I know for sure in 2022 I will be only shopping here.",5
849,"Overall Love it!: I have been both a seller and a buyer, I love the mission and all the clothes I have received. There are a couple of weak points; first is they used to list the length of shirts n sweaters, I’m tall so that matters, they aren’t including that information anymore. My 2nd concern is contacting them with questions, I had no luck, tried repeatedly and gave up! I needed to contact them again when I recommended my friend n set up an account for her, again I had no access to ask questions, very frustrating, I tried to go thru “ contact us” with no success. If not for these concerns I would’ve given them 5 stars",5
850,"Unreliable shipping: I love ThredUP and it’s not their fault that FedEx is not capable of making a package go straight to its location, but I wish that they could find a more reliable shipper. I chose to bundle an order, yet one part of it arrived in two bags after a few days and the last part of it has been traveling north and south across the country and then finally west to me for two weeks. It’s been with FedEx in California for four days and I still don’t have it. So, don’t order anything you need in a hurry because there is no way to know when a package will get to you. Other than that, ThredUP is awesome for quality used clothing.",4
851,"Addicted: I love ThredUP! I’ve found some really incredible deals on this app and have even bought some items for my 17 yr old granddaughter. I will say you need to be patient and spend time looking for what want to really find great deals. I buy a lot of brand new items with the tags still on for great prices. The actual measurements are usually in the comments so be sure to look at those before buying. 

I have had an item that was simply lost in the mail. I contacted customer service and was refunded for the purchase. 

Highly recommend this service (unless you’re my size...then please shop somewhere else 😉).",4
852,"Love ThredUP but the search engine: I love browsing ThredUP and have made many purchases. I prefer to try things on at a store but that’s not possible in most places in NY because of coronavirus so I’ve been enjoying ThredUP even more. If I could make two tiny complaints it would be that you can’t search for things very easily beyond brand or color. For example, I found a nice sweater with an elephant print by stumbling upon it, but could never type in “elephant” and be shown that sweater. The other thing is that it’s hard to understand dress length without a proper mannequin or pictures of real people. Thank you ThredUP for being so great in general!",4
853,Ok so far: I just started using this app about 2 weeks ago. I ordered a few items and currently waiting for them to arrive. I really like the selection of items so far. The prices are reasonable on most things but too high on others. It would be very helpful if more than 2 photographs of the item were posted. It’s very difficult to decide to purchase something that you can’t judge very well based on 2 tiny photos. The search options aren’t so great either. It’s difficult to find a specific item. You have to look through an entire category. I do like that I only pay 1 shipping fee on multiple items. I’m considering sending some clothes I’ve had laying around for a while via their clean out kit.,3
854,"Amazing!!: I’ve been ordering from ThredUP for over a year now and I absolutely love it. It makes buying high quality clothing really affordable (especially for a college student). I’ve never had issues with customer service or packages arriving late. Returning things you don’t want is quick and easy too! I love that I can get good quality clothing without having to buy new things. 

Pro tip: get a build your own goody bag! It allows you to try on a bunch of different items and narrow down your sizes with certain brands. The best part is that the $10 down payment goes towards the items you decide to keep!",5
855,"Lack Of Communication: I have been shopping ThredUP for many years and I absolutely love the store, but the past year you cannot reach anyone to expedite a problem. You cannot call and live chat is a joke. I message them and wait patiently - this is when they ask me to contact them - and 48 hours later - still no response. I deal will communications everyday and I believe if they are going to continue to grow, they must simply invest in communication with their customers. This is very frustrating. I do not like leaving a bad review!  I shop here at least once a week!  Please put the customer first. This is sad.",5
856,"Found Nirvana: Having been a life long thrift store peruser, I like to believe I have developed a good eye for great quality. Girls, you know we love finding treasures for a steal! ThredUp does all the hard work for you. Genius struck the web when this site was launched. It is ANY kind of shoppers heaven! I find myself daily indulging in a peek that turns into an hours long marathon of viewing merchandise that intrigues and so very often delights itself right into my wardrobe. Am also in the midst of closet clean out with the intent to ship it all painlessly to ThredUp, where you are given the chance to give and receive in more ways than one. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
857,The only way I’ll online shop: This app is incredible its my favorite app to browse the deals are super easy to use and the shipping is so fast and accurate once its delivered i get an email immediately! The only thing i wish was better is the quality of the pictures and the mannequin they use. I wish i could see the details better bc I have received some items I wouldn't have bought if i saw that the fabric was one I didnt like. The descriptions only go so far into describing the item and not much is given on how some items are flawed.,5
858,"Glitchy App and Arbitrary Prices Make It Not Worth It: I’ve been a ThredUp customer for years. I’ve gotten some pretty great deals here, and even sold through them. I like that you can look up exactly what you’re looking for.

But unfortunately we are breaking up. The app is glitchy with cart timers and random price hikes and drops. Prices are arbitrary—the same two items can be wildly different prices. Sometimes what they charge for secondhand is very nearly what it costs new. Shipping is unnecessarily expensive, making what looks like a good deal add up to more than you thought, and it’s ground shipping so it takes a long time. Even the “deals” and “rewards” don’t honestly give you that much of a break. It’s too much of a headache.",2
859,"highly disappointed: I would personally not recommend this app to anyone selling clothes. I have not bought clothes off of this app so I can’t speak on that, however I put two full bags of clothes with some higher end brands and received no payment. I understand commission rates, but with little I was going to get paid back they took it and said it was another handling fee even though I already paid that initially. When I reached out to customer service they were absolutely no help at all and said that most of the clothes didn’t sell even though on my end it said they all did. Very confusing and very frustrating. 
I read the reviews and thought it was a good app, but just wanted to give my experience. If I had known I would’ve just donated the clothes to someone.",1
860,"LOVE IT! But one suggestion: First and foremost, I stumbled upon this app a few months ago because a YouTuber mentioned it. I loveee it! It’s officially my go store to for all shopping. It’s really helped me expand my wardrobe! My only suggestion to enhance the experience is if we were able to sort through the items we “favorite”. Maybe be able to create boards/categories (shoes, dresses, tops, work, casual, formal, etc) similar to how Pinterest is set up. Or at the very least, have a search bar for our favorites so we can quickly find a particular item we’ve saved.",5
861,"Searching for maternity clothing doesn’t work…: I usually love this app and the whole concept behind it, but lately I’ve been trying to find maternity clothes that are lightly-used because new ones are so expensive and I’m getting very uncomfortable. I constantly have maternity clothing popping up in ads for thredUP on my social media and sometimes I will get them as suggestions as well, but they’re never my size and when I go to the app and actually type in “maternity“-anything, I either get that there are “no results” or a very select few results that aren’t even maternity clothes. 

Please fix this issue so that us expectant mothers can have an easier time shopping! I’m sure there are people selling clothes that make nursing easier postpartum as well that are having the same issue.",1
862,"It’s okay: If you’re concerned for the planet, shop here at ThredUP. As a Seller, unless you have high-end pieces, you’ll only see Pennies-on-the-Dollar to what ThredUP will receive. Yes, they take a BIG CUT, all for the good of the Planet, right? As a Buyer, they should take multiple discount coupons instead of just one. For you as a Buyer, it’s either or: use the platform-wide discount or use your rewards; can’t be both. Shame. Plus, once you get “free shipping”, if you use a discount AND the total is under the free shipping amount, ThredUP charges you shipping. Come on, dude. Really? But, you gotta remember, you’re helping the planet. Ha.",5
863,"Best kept secret: I didn’t want to leave a review and have everyone find about about this amazing secret. This has been the only place I’ve bought clothes for years, and when I’m ready to go through my closet I just sell them all back! If you feel any guilt buying clothes because of the environmental impact of fast fashion (and the price tag of slow fashion) seek no further. Purchases are always newer than I expect, are clean, and come wrapped in nice paper. My only qualm is that I have to remember that the mannequins are much slimmer than I am and buy clothes accordingly.",5
864,"Highly Recommend: I have been using ThredUp for a couple years now, and I love it! I’m always excited to get my polka-dot box. I find so many cute outfits and shoes for cheap. I appreciate being able to filter for my sizes and look up the brands I love most. It’s way more convenient than digging through a thrift store, and there are a lot of great sales. Plus, you get store credit by making purchases and donating your clothes. Overall, I’d definitely recommend this app to anyone who wants to try shopping second-hand and/or enjoys retail therapy but is on a budget!",5
865,"Send a Clean Out bag if you want your clothes stolen: Processors steal items regularly. If you want to prevent them from stealing from your clean out bags you have to make sure you check for unaccepted items to be sent back for a fee.

All other clean out bags are put through a process that is unchecked by management. When you complain they essentially tell you to kick rocks. I’ve had many quality items stolen and “not selected for processing”. They claim they’re recycling but I’m highly doubtful this is true.

I’ll never attempt any sort of clean out bag from this company ever again. No customer assurance checks are put into place, employees are allowed to steal. This company needs to seriously look at their processing techniques and put more checks into place to make sure customers are being protected.",1
866,"Expensive, & Restocking fees, label Charge: Funny how you can’t rate one star because your review and your comment won’t go through so you have to rate them 5 stars for your review to be posted what a joke. a cool app and I like a lot of the things that they have, however....... they have become more and more expensive, you are better off buying from the clearance racks and stores like marshals and TJX max, at least they will be brand new never worn and can return without a restocking fee if it doesn’t fit. They charge you a restocking fee on top of the shipping label which all in all they are still making money regardless.",5
867,"Love It!: The ThreadUp app organizes clothing so well and it has the feel of a department store app! Better yet, ThreadUp remembers your preferred shopping sizes so it’ll save you time when you search for clothing! There are so many great ways to refine your searches to get a certain item that you’re looking for. I have heard many Youtubers and fashion bloggers talking about their success in finding cute clothes with ThreadUp and after giving it a shot, it was the best decision I made when choosing a store to buy clothing from. It’s fairly priced and customer friendly, and I will definitely recommend to a friend and continue using it again.",5
868,"Just can’t get enough!: There is so much too love about ThredUp! From their discounts and deals including your rewards bonuses to their ways of organizing and exceptionally useful filters. So easy, user friendly and quick! The fact that they measure almost every garment by hand to post in the description just makes it an even better shopping experience. As long as you know your own current measurements you can’t go wrong shopping at ThredUp and you won’t even notice the money you spend because their prices are unbeatable!",5
869,"The ONLY place I shop for clothes now: EDITED: the shipping on this app is awful. I think I’ll stick to thrift shops and second hand stores in person. It’s a good app if you don’t care when your stuff actually gets to you. 
Original review: 5 stars down to 2 because the shipping is infuriating! 
I stumbled upon the app after a particularly discouraging trip to the mall. Everything was over priced and cheapy looking, and everyone in the mall looked miserable. It was pretty much a perfect summation of consumerism.
 I understand the irony in my disdain for shopping malls while reviewing a shopping app but I lost a lot of weight and needed clothes. 
The mall was just full of all this over priced junk waiting around in crappy lighting. I felt sleazy just being at a mall but in the car on the way out I found thredUP. 
Unfortunately, I had just sent 6 bags of clothes to goodwill (because I’ve lost 70lbs in a year) but I have bought clothes and absolutely love it!!! I will be sending stuff to sell on here from now on. 
So yes my review may be virtue signally or hypocritical but honestly shopping on thredUP helps me feel better about shopping and I look forward to giving my clothes a second life too.",2
870,"Great concept, the company is still in the learning curve: I have been using Thredup for 3 years, at first, amazing customer service, which went downhill the past 1 year -- sometimes I get a response back a week later. 
It is a great site to find a wide variety of designer clothes at amazing prices. Selling your items to them is not going to rake in lots of $$$. I used to donate to Goodwill, now I still sell to them a good chunk of my unwanted items, though I sell things on other sites on my own still. 
There are so many constant changes to the site, it makes my head spin -- I guess they are still figuring out what best suits them and the customers.
I am less enthusiastic of a shopper than I used to be but still enjoy finding cool pieces.",3
871,"Payout and App: I feel as though their payout are even LOWER than they were when I first sent my first bag out to ThredUP. Originally, I was rather impressed with the payout of my first few bags, one was around $70 and the next $45. Now, my payouts were around $7!!!!! Huge difference. Clearly, they are making a HUGE profit on our clothes. I saw a pair of my barely worn Banana Republic shorts listed for $10 where they paid me, $.50!!!! Really? .50 cents!!!! That’s not okay if you ask me! 

Also, the app needs some work being reconstructed when you are looking at your items that were excepted. You can’t see them. If you want to see it all, you have to go to the website from your home computer. 

Looks like my ThredUP bag that I requested will end up in the garage, sadly. You’ve LOST yet another customer, ThredUP!!!",2
872,"LOVE: I love ThredUP. I always have new clothes coming, and with the return policy, there is no risk! There is a $2/item re-stock fee for things that you return, but after a while, you gain enough points to waive the fee. And even still, it’s much more convenient to passively shop, buy a decent haul of 5 or 6 things and return what doesn’t work. I’ll pay a couple bucks for that! 
I also love the convenience of the saved searches. I have a certain brand of jeans that I’ve always liked- I have that brand in my size saved, I can always see what’s available.",5
873,"Digital Goodwill: Limited pics of items. Descriptions often don’t match the item. What I consider good condition with minor wear, the person who lists the item might call like new. I just ignore most of the clothing measurements, as many of the same item in the same size won’t match. I would say about 10-20% of my purchases get returned for these reasons. At least customer service is quite compliant, if you can get ahold of them. The app makes it a little challenging to get in touch with a human. It’s a great company and a great initiative well worth supporting. It just needs a more polished experience and listing process to be great.",4
874,"Terrible experience: I sent 2 clean out kits in September of 2022. Finally processed in February of 2023. But that didn’t bother me. I sent at least 30 bags together in both boxes, I didn’t count because I thought I could trust this company, they processed 16…selling a bag for $64 and my % is $14!! Wow! I have tried to send a message, (no customer service number at all!) at least 7 times and have had absolutely no response whatsoever! And then if your items don’t sell within I believe 2 weeks, if you want them back, you’re paying $10 per item for shipping!! I must add, these are very high end bags I shipped them! Needless to say, this has been the worst experience I’ve had with any company platform! This has ended up costing me money! I do not recommend letting them sell your items! Sell them yourself!",1
875,"Easy to use…but buggy: App is easy to use, flow is simple to follow. I find the app to be a bit buggy in that it freezes on me quite a bit. Not sure the root cause, but I can usually close it out, wait a few minutes, and return and it works smoothly for a while. 

ThreadUp itself…cannot state how much I love it! Love that the app organizes clothes by sizes and style. Seriously, I hate shopping but I love ThreadUp.  I may never visit another mall as long as I live. 

The layout of the app is also inviting, with fresh colors and looks constantly updating. Reminds me of Stitch Fix…but with a more reasonable price point and more sustainability 😎",4
876,"The absolute best way to create your wardrobe: I shop on ThredUP quite often. The prices are usually amazing especially if you shop during one of their sales events. One of best parts about using ThredUP is their rewards program, I believe. You can earn $10 off, Free Shipping, Free Restock fee on return items, and other things. I usually opt for $10 off. Read the description to see what condition the item is in. So far, everything I’ve received was in great shape and had so much life left in it. Some are even new with tags. Once you try it, you will love it… trust me!",5
877,"My New Favorite Resale Sho: I almost exclusively shop resale via thrifting and local consignment shops with the occasional online purchase. I have ordered 3 times now on ThredUP and have been thrilled with not only the quality and condition of my purchases but also the packaging, prices and ease of browsing on the app. I stick to searching brands I love and know how they will fit, and have not had to send anything back!

I do wish that there was at least one more photo for details of a pattern, etc. That is my only note. I will definitely be selling through ThredUP, too. I love the whole concept and loyalty program. Really smart businesses!",4
878,"The only place I shop!!: I’ve been using ThredUP for the past 4 years and I love it. I like shopping second hand but I hate looking through all of those clothes, and if i find something I like 8/10 it’s not my size😣😣😣. This app allows me to search exactly what I’m looking for. Now, my only complaint which is just recently is with the shipping. But now I expect to get my package within 3 weeks and it’s not so bad because I’m expecting it in that time frame. If I need something quick, I’ll choose to shop locally. But I’m pleased because of the quality clothes I get to purchase now which I wouldn’t have before.",4
879,"My new favorite store: Ive been using Thred Up for about 8 months now and I love it! I have only had to return two items. One was a dress that ran small and one was a skirt that was different from the color I’d envisioned. Everything else has been exactly as I’d expected. Excellent quality and most like brand new. I’ve gotten some gorgeous designer shoes and purses that were well priced deals.

I have also sent in bags to sell and have been pleased to give my clothes a new life. I take great care of them and I believe they sold well because they were well cared for, clean and carefully folded so they had no wrinkles. 

I’m definitely a fan!",4
880,"I’m addicted!: If you are tired of wearing a “uniform” (mine was t-shirt and jeans) and want to break out of your rut, then this is where you go to start your new life as a fashion plate, living in full color 3D. You can try new styles that you never would have thought of before, mixing and matching for super cheap. Don’t love some pieces? Return them! But most of what I’ve gotten were really unique finds, treasures that people ask, “where did you get that?” I never thought that thrifting online would work but IT DOES. They have everything from bathing suits to overcoats. I love shopping here and I do often because it is so affordable!!",5
881,"I’m obsessed: I’ve bought exclusively from here for the past two years with zero issues. I read through the bad reviews and they seem to just not read the section about the description and quality of the item. Also, you’re buying second hand?? And it’s so much easier than rummaging through a thrift store so I think so people’s standards are too high lol. This place is amazing and I get compliments on everything I’ve ordered bc it’s all such good quality and CUTE. Plus, their return process and policy is the easiest I’ve ever used. Love love love it.",5
882,"Proceed with caution: This is not a well-run operation. There’s a major problem with return processing with ThredUp. It’s been over 2 months since my return was processed and I still haven’t gotten a refund. (It took 6 weeks to get a refund on another order.) Don’t choose the store credit option, it seems to take even longer than a regular refund, and at this point I don’t want to spend it anymore.

Try it if you want to, but don’t spend money you’re not willing to lose. The selection’s not bad, even though the prices are high for used clothing. I got some great stuff with ThredUp, but the hassle of trying to get my money back for returns makes me want to try the competition instead. I can’t even imagine trying to sell something on this service.",2
883,"Missing Information, Slow Processing: I ordered bags to clean out my closet, and made an account when I did that.  I mailed in two very large bags three months ago and their website STILL shows that I haven’t sent anything in.  Then, I was on their website and saw where you could order a box, custom picked for you, so I ordered one.  When I got the box, there was NOT ONE THING that I would even consider wearing, so I returned the entire box.  Their website says I have placed no orders and that I have nothing eligible for return.  This company is a total SCAM!!  And now they have hundreds of dollars OF MY CLOTHES!  I suggest you go to Goodwill - your odds of getting something decent are much better and it’s tax deductible when you donate - unlike “thredUP” who takes your clothes under the pretense they are going to sell them and give you a portion of the sale price.",1
884,"I no longer use Thred Up: I have found Thred Up's descriptions to be not totally accurate and lacking details.  Items are way over priced for what you get, but sometimes you get lucky.
For example, I paid $20 for a North Fleece quarter-zip that looked old and used with loose threads at the hem.  I was able to return it.
There were other purchases they messed up (like sending me THE WRONG item) in which I had to go out of my way to prove they sent me the wrong thing so they would allow me to return it.  
Like I said, I no longer use ThredUp, and I do not recommend it to anyone.
UPDATE: I tried ThredUP again in 2020. I’m finding many descriptions are still inaccurate. I placed 3 orders and several items that said, “Like New, you might just mistake it for new!” There’s no mistaking the fact that they have signs of wear, even signs of heavy wear, alterations, etc.",1
885,"Expensive: I’m finding their prices very expensive for used clothing. I don’t care what the original price is, 50% off that for a shirt worn several times is not a fair pricing. I can’t get a new shirt 50-70% of at Tj max or ross I bought a purse that had more ware and tare then described yet couldn’t return because it was a “ final sale” I do love their “ bundle and save” option for free shipping at $79. Charging a restocking fee if the item doesn’t fit and returned. You pay shipping and restocking fee. I don’t believe you can ask questions either. Hate this site. Finally spent my credit for items that didn’t fit bit it cost me app $20 because of that return restocking and reship new item.  Poshmark is much better. I’ll never shop here again not will I recommend. In fact, I’ll discourage whomever inquires.",2
886,"I’m done as soon as I use my credit!: At first I thought thredUP was great. Then I started getting no so great items and having problems with customer service. 
First, items are not hugely discounted. You can get these items cheaper at goodwill or sometimes on clearance racks at the department stores. 
Second, items are old. They maybe in good condition but many items are older than five years (which they request not sending to sell). 
When you get items that don’t fit, have a hole, or weren’t as described you still get a restocking fee of $1.99. If you want your money back it is $8.99 that is deducted from your refund. So, they defiantly don’t make it worth your while to shop online. Especially, since like other reviews say, they don’t have enough pictures for items.
Lastly, It also takes forever to get your item and if you return it, it takes a long time to get your credit to reorder something. There is never a clear breakdown of your return either. It’s been said in other reviews, and it’s true, it says one thing one place and another someplace else. 
As soon as I use my credit, I will no longer be a customer.",2
887,"Good Store But…….: I’ve gotten many of my cuter clothes from here without feeling bad for buying either new clothes or fast fashion. I love how the bundles work it really save you money so you don’t have to keep paying for shipping if you found something else. HOWEVER,  I was trying to shop for some clothes for my boyfriend and it’s ALL women’s clothes with some kids clothes. I have sent men’s clothing to them before and never saw it in my tracking for when others could buy it. Men’s clothes can be expensive too and I’m sure everyone would appreciate the men being included too, to save more for the environment!",4
888,"Not worth sending clothing in: I have so many clothes to get rid of and started to feel overwhelmed at the thought of personally listing them all. I thought I’d give it a try sending them to ThredUP to take the work out. NOT WORTH IT! I’d rather give my clothes away to someone than to basically give them to a business that’s going to short change you. The clothes that don’t sell are the ones I’m sure they either list elsewhere to make more coin, or employees get to keep. I bought some nice things on here but now feel like I’m contributing to this business of ripping people off if I buy again. Something of yours could sell on here for $35 and you only get $3 of that.. how is that even close to fair?? Don’t waste your time.",2
889,"Standards are slipping and processing very slow: I got some  items listed as “like new” that had obvious signs of wear. And I was shocked to get “outlet” items (no returns) with holes in the clothing :( I thought they had higher standards.
I sent items for consignment over 4 months ago and they still haven’t been processed. This is the second and last time I will try. I guess they have too many contributors and not enough employees. 
I had a really hard time getting information about the status of my kit and never did get in touch with an actual person. So zero stars for customer service.
The only reason they get more than 1 star is because I have bought a few awesome quality cashmere sweaters from them that I really love.",2
890,"Will change the face of retail: I have been a ThredUp customer for a month now. I just received my first goody box, and I will be keeping 3 of the 10 items. I’m a very particular shopper, so 3/10 is excellent. 

The clothes are very reasonably priced. The Women Within jeans are $15. One sweater is $55, which I think is a bit high but I love it. I’m also keeping a silk kimono- not usually my style, but it feels so fun when I put it on.

I was about to go buy stock in ThredUp, but they aren’t public yet. This is definitely a company to watch. I may need to delete the app from my phone, because I’ve been shopping a little too much.",5
891,"LOVE IT!!!!: ThredUP is legit for buying used clothing.  They have coupon codes often, awesome search filters, expensive and cheaper brands, easy returns, good customer support, and it’s addictive.  I’ve spent too much money on ThredUP, but that’s my fault.  I’m a repeat customer.

Cons: You barely make any money selling your clothes on here, unless it’s a brand worth a lot of money.  You get a higher percentage if it’s an expensive piece.  If you sell a shirt from a cheaper brand, like Old Navy, you’re probably lucky to make 50 cents on the garment.  It’s a great place for rich people to clean out their closets and try to help the planet at the same time.",5
892,Great App!: I’ve only been with Thread Up for a couple of weeks but so far I’m totally impressed. I’ve purchased 4 items so far and I’m happy with them all. You can get good stuff for great prices! And the app makes it so easy to find what you’re looking for! I just signed up with Thread Up’s “Goodie Box” and I’m so excited. I can’t wait to see what’s in it! Also I have contacted their support team with a couple of questions by email and received a response the next day. But Beware....you can spend hours in this app shopping! There’s so much to choose from.  Great job Thread Up!,5
893,I hate shopping but I love this app: I hate shopping but I love scrolling! This app is everything I love about the great thrift store find with out having to leave my home or family. I am a busy mom of 3 boys who never has the time to spend hours sifting through the consignment racks. We also live in rural Colorado so the trek into my nearest descent thrift / consignment store is well over an hour this app has bought back my love of browsing. It’s gotten me off the social media threads in the preschool pick up line and on to doing something for myself and it has reignited my passion for personal style even as a SAHM! And..... it’s freaking affordable.,5
894,"WAS my favorite place to shop.....: I get that they have to keep changing their policies to see what works for them, but each one makes me less likely to shop here!! Now just ONE hour in the cart before your item gets put back on the rack? And the items get sent in random little packages over time rather than the one big box like it used to home in.  It used to be my favorite pastime to build these bulk purchases (for the free shipping) and then get a big box of goodies...  Now you gotta click purchase right away or you’ll lose the item... and definitely pay shipping as you won’t find a ton of things in less than an hour.  It was so much fun, and I never shut up about how much I enjoyed the process.  Come on a ThredUP!!! I spend thousands there!! Or did.... 😢",2
895,"It’s great except for one thing...: I love thredUp I’ve been shopping there for a few years now and it’s all been great, the only problem I have is that occasionally there’s one thing that really gets to me about it, the fact that people are apparently allowed to take certain thing from other peoples carts. When I have one thing in my cart it’s suddenly not available because it’s already been sold to someone else while it’s been in my cart, or I’ll have already purchased something and only learn that it’s not available after the package comes, they refund you for your purchase really quickly, it jut irks me that it’s a thing that happens.",4
896,"Pregnancy wardrobe: I am currently 7 months pregnant in a high risk pregnancy. I haven’t shown at all until the last two weeks and my employer started complaining that I’d begun wearing T-shirt’s due to newfound issues fitting into most of my clothes. I’ve used ThredUp before, but just recently started using them again. I managed to completely rebuild my wardrobe for less than $100 due to some scrupulous shopping. Now I went from crying at work because I was being harassed about my wardrobe to being complimented on my fashion again. High quality, inexpensive clothes and I feel good about myself again. 5/5, go ThredUp ❤️",5
897,"I’m hooked😍: I love this site. I check it all the time to see what’s been added. My orders have arrived in a reasonable time and with the cutest packaging! Each item I got was in great shape and true to site specifications. Since there’s all sorts of brands and sizes vary widely, I check on that stores website for size charts if they are available. I think it’s fantastic I can buy a 5 dollar shirt or dress.... with the tags still on it! Totally feeds my thrifting bug without having to wade through the mess of Goodwill or St Vinnies. I’ve been telling everyone I know about this site! ❤️❤️❤️

P.S. the mobile site runs beautifully and is a joy to use!",5
898,"ThredUp and app experience: ThredUp’s App is great for hunting for whatever your heart desires. You can slice, dice and dissect your search into a million different option to find what it is you’re looking for. You can upload a photo of what you’re
hoping to find, sort by fabric, color, neck style, arm style etc…

I just bought three casual dresses all in excellent condition and well below their suggested retail price. I also found a pair of $295 designer sneaks for $35 (excellent condition) and 2 designer totes for amazing prices and in very good condition. Love love finding great deals and this app makes it easy!!!",5
899,"My #1 Way to Shop: I love everything about buying and selling on ThredUP. The only thing I don’t like is that they sometimes get measurements wrong. And there could be a few more ways to categorize clothing. And example of this: In the category Skirts you can search for the Styles Long, Pencil, Fit & Flare, etc. but you can’t search for Accordion or Circle. Which is pretty lame bc I’d rather not wade through 10,000 bodycon style skirts to find a cute circle skirt. 
You also can’t really narrow your search. You can kind of only widen it. 
But that said, still amazing, well worth it, and pretty much the only way I clothing shop now.",4
900,"Been a godsend for professional attire: I love love love this app/site. I’ve been able to find so many business casual sheath dresses for dirt cheap. Petite section is hard to search for only and there’s not a whole lot that is labeled petite, you honestly just have to hope and go by the inseam measurements. Would love to see more products with measurements listed in the description or additional photo, I really will only buy items that have that information. Pretty fast shipping too once processed. My last order only took a week from purchase to delivery!",5
901,"Great app: I love it. You can get high end designer or cheaper stuff, and they do frequent promos for free shipping or discounts plus the Points rewards keeps me coming back. I have ordered a few things that I had to return, and it was so easy.

The only recommendation I have is to make it easier to search for specific styles maybe with more keywords in item descriptions or something. I often look for things based on an inspiration outfit and too specific a search returns no findings so I have to make it more vague and hunt and peck through thousands of items",5
902,"Horrible measurement sys/pics/fees!!: You started out great, but with no returns on many sale & (obv final sale items) this 3.99 PER item restocking fee, is way overboard. This is a consignment shop isn’t it??  I spent $200 on 1 order & because your sizing was incorrect, I had to return almost half which btw, doesn’t get refunded, only thred up credit, minus those restocking fees etc…Also, when customers order more than 10 or so items they really should automatically get your “outlet” deals/pricing! 
It’s obvious you guys haven’t upgraded anything (besides the prices of course) certainly not the quality of your clothing pics. Also, just get rid of those so called rewards, it’s never a deal if you can’t use rewards with a sale!",2
903,"I LOVE ITT: The main thing about it is that everything is good quality. You might have the look carefully for sizing but that’s every other shop. They sure won’t be any rips, tears , or unexpected odor. Everything is packaged with no plastic except the tape ( this is very little). The website is super easy to use because instead of going through thousands of clothing yourself , you can put on filters and even save your size. If I were to buy something I’d look on thredUP first and it’s there most of the time with near new condition for like 70% off the retail price",5
904,"User since before it blew up!: My most recent orders (albeit not as often as before because of the pandemic) have been 50/50 in terms of meeting my expectations. Some items have come with bad stains and it wasn’t in the description - just labeled as ‘like new’ and no visible flaws. Yes, one had a period stain…and pretty sure the other one is blood (?) and it’s in several places so very visible. I have yet to contact customer service because I understand quality control becomes harder as the business expands. I am sure they’ll be responsive though! Thanks for making sustainable shopping practices more accessible!",4
905,Great Customer Service!: I’ve placed a handful of orders with ThredUP and also sent in a couple of bags worth of clothes for them to sell. The process for everything went smoothly. The app works well and you can do everything you want to do- from buying to selling flawlessly via the app. They also have great customer service. After a handful of purchases I ad my first issue (a piece of clothing that ended up being maternity sized not regular sized). They not only handled the issue quickly but the resolution was even better than I expected. I will continue to buy and sell clothes through ThredUP.,5
906,Good but.: My first time ordering everything went smoothly and I got my package in a timely manner the second time around I ordered my package on July 21 it didn’t ship until the 29th they said they were shipping from one warehouse and I had to wait 8 to 10 days to get my package. Well here it is 1 August and my tracking hasn’t updated since the 29th I can’t get a good answer out of FedEx I’m assuming they lost my package and thread up chat support is no good because it always just sends you back to the website so you can’t contact customer service to tell them and emails take up to three days according to them.  This was a birthday present to myself so I’m very disappointed.,3
907,"Great concept, half-baked app: Love the concept behind thread-up, always manage to find cute and fashionable items, but the app has always felt half-baked. Like when I went to ‘chat with customer service’ it brings up a browser window within the app asking me to login to my account, sometimes it just brings up a blank screen. It’s also really annoying to not have all of the categories available to filter (there is a shoe category on the main page, but when you’re in the women’s department, you can’t filter your search for shoes). It would also be nice to have a close-up shot of the material on items along with the material description.",3
908,"Twice bitten: I would love to give this app a third chance but I’m extremely apprehensive. Long story short, I ordered a purse years back that never got delivered. When I asked customer service about it, they said it had been confirmed delivered...but alas no package was to be found anywhere in my apartment building. I kind of got the impression they weren’t going to help me from then on, so I just got my losses. I was a busy college student. Now just a few months ago I thought I would give the selling side of Thred Up a try and requested one of those donation bags to be sent to me. Once again, it never turned up, and the tracking number is broken. At this point it’s just not worth my time to try to pursue this any longer. I love thrift shopping and truly would want to buy from this app, but I’m starting to think I’m being played a fool here",1
909,"Good clothes, horrible customer service: I’ve ordered several things from them but when I had to return something that’s when I experienced the horrible customer service. I ordered a goody box. I had to email customer service to find out if they were still sending it because it had been a month. They finally sent it and I found out that they went above my preferred price range for most of the items. Long story short they finally refunded me. I had one additional item to send back and did. It’s been two weeks since the item has been returned and I have not received a response when I request support or when I reply to the thread that was started. I just sent another email in an attempt to get a response. This is ridiculous!",2
910,"Amazing App: I have been a loyal user of ThredUP for a few years now. There have been a few instances where measurements didn’t match up with the product purchased (it was too small, etc.) but the majority has been a great experience and it saves me so much money. I’ve always been very frugal (I love going to local thrift stores or Plato’s closets’ when I can) but this saves me so much time versus searching racks at a huge thrift store. I’ve found a lot of great work blouses, casual dresses, etc. Overall, it’s a great app at its core that needs a few improvements regarding customer service response time, size listing, etc.",5
911,"Great Concept, but...: The concept of have second hand items at your fingertips is amazing but not being able to speak to someone to resolve issues is NOT. Two out of three occasions I have ordered plus size clothes and received items that were clearly not plus size. Trying to find a telephone number or an email address for customer service was torturous to say the least. I returned the items both times with a hand written note explaining the problem and returning the items as a donation since I was unable to make contact with a humane being. I still have yet to receive follow up correspondence from the customer service department. Customer service support is nonexistent. Such a shame.",3
912,"Lost my bvlgary sunglasses: I have been enjoying cleaning my closet and buying cool brand stuff. Sometimes the items don’t seem like the pictures but it is the online shopping, I didn’t care much. However, the experience of selling my designer sunglasses was very uncomfortable. At the first time, I sent two of chanel sunglasses. I didn’t see it on my selling list so reached out the customer service and they said they lost it. 
For second time I send a gucci bag and a bvlgary sunglasses that I have been barely used, really in good condition. No pictures uploaded again so I reaches, they are saying it is not qualified and they cannot find it so won’t return it either. 
I am very disappointed and just lost my items! Return policy is not clear enough, they can just say the item is not qualified.",2
913,"Stay away...I want it all!: Almost hate to share as I LOVE shopping at Thred up. Great app experience, great filters to find what I want, great experience as most items even better than they look but a no hassle return experience if not. However I am less than thrilled at having a return fee per item. At most, should have the 1.99 return fee on the whole return group.  I always choose the free store credit options for returns as I know I’ll be back, but I don’t know if that will work given the restock fee for me. I am buying less now because of it, but do still love the overall experience.",5
914,"Truly the best place to buy sustainable, affordable clothes: I rave about thredup constantly. Between the affordable prices, great customer service, ethics of the brand, and the sales, rewards and free shipping, this company and app TRULY does it all. 

Are you a fancy lady? They have deals on designer clothes in new condition. Are you a bargain Hunter? They have deals on quality clothing that is actually IN STYLE and WORK APPROPRIATE. 

I have been using thredup since 2017 and they have only gotten better since then. I have purchased and sold clothing via the website and app and both are phenomenal.

My only wish for them would be to add a mens section for my partner. He feels left out. And I am sad to see the goody boxes program for but I understand why. It would be great to reinstate that for an extra fee, I loved getting them! 

I have never had a bad experience with this company and they are not paying me to say this. I truly love and appreciate what they do.",5
915,"Scam: I don’t write reviews but I would have rather given my chlothes to goodwill. I had gotten one of their cleanout bags which entails thredup sending you a bag that you fill with chlothes that are “trendy” and you don’t wear anymore/ don’t want and they give you a paper that shows you what thred up is interested in and you choose to either have the chlothes thrown away if thred up chooses they do not like the chlothes or they will recycle them . I chose recycle. I had specific items that I gave to them that the app said was in season that they wanted with tags and everything , they told me NONE of my chlothes (some very expensive ,tags on in style) were not accepted . Little did I know they sell boxes of “unwanted” chlothes and shoes on their site , basically they lie to you and sell your chlothes for profit behind your back and you won’t get money for your clothes.",1
916,"Good principle but…: While I appreciate the philosophy and outlook behind the app—reducing, reusing and recycling, I always have questions that never get answered. I am on the selling and buying end. As a seller, things are never clear—what I just got paid for—if you have a lot of items, where is the item you sent and it was not returned and it’s not listed, why some items are listed with payout dates and not others, why when I click on other sellers’ items, I can see their other items, but not mine, why some items disappear after being sold—not just marked sold as the others.   Things should be clear for everyone, for everything, or I am left to believe things are poorly handled and dishonest.",2
917,"Please don’t give your stuff to this store so they can fill their pockets!: I would have rather give all the new stuff to charity. The basically take 90% profit out of the products YOU SEND claiming they pay for shipping and stuff. Example I sent a pair of new rain boots London Rebel they sold for $23 dollars and I got $3. I could have sell it through Mercari and I would have get the $20 myself. In any case you won’t get any profit out of this. To finish they charge me for some sort of handling and out of the 5 products they that were sold, I was supposed to get $11 dollars and I just have $2.30 dollars to cash out — why? No clue. No there’s absolutely nothing I can do because I did not take the time to read the important part of this bad deal. In any case, just don’t do it. You’re welcome.",1
918,"Love it!: I’ve never ordered from an app like this before but I made my first order after a lot of digging for what I wanted. It took about 10 days for my order to get delivered but I was really satisfied with everything I bought. I got a cocktail dress, skirt, 2 crop tops and 2 tank tops for $50 including shipping! I’m kind of having a hard time convincing myself to spend money on clothes anywhere else when I can get good quality items for way less on ThredUp. Definitely college kid approved and I will 100% be looking on here for all clothes shopping needs.",5
919,"They Ban Shoppers: After several yrs, and well over $1,000 satisfied orders received it seems somethings going on on THREADUPS end. Suddenly orders are inaccurate in descriptions, handbags state Leather & came made of cheap, stiff, fake materials. I randomly received an unordered woman’s XS sweater, I contacted them and was told to donate. Then a few weeks later a top I was excited to get comes & it’s a open front ugly red 3xL sweater. I reached out to dispute the charge and reluctantly printed a return label & contacted customer support to complain the restock fee should be waived and I got a short response that it appears I took the charge up with my credit card, why wouldn’t I? 
I decided no more clothes I’ll give it one more try and I ordered another woman’s bag & I get a banner on the top of my account that says I AM BANNED. Who does business like that?",1
920,"Great Brands for a Value: I would recommend ThredUp to any bargain hunter with an eye for fashion who wants to revise their wardrobe. I recently purchased $75 worth of name-brand quality clothing that would cost $662+ retail. The only thing is you can’t return outlet items, so if you’re willing to take a chance on them, go for it! They also have good rewards for multi-time buyers. I’ve bought from them a few times and have been happy with the outcomes. You can always resell on another platform if it doesn’t turn out or donate. Read each item description carefully. It accurately depicts clothing quality.",5
921,"My New Pace to Shop: Thread Up’s first package was everything I needed!  2nd package was better!  Now I’m ordering the 3rd,  still waiting on my items sent to be evaluated, to learn how many points I earned.  An email told me they were behind because of C-19.  I understand, but keep checking daily for my points!  Used 100 points for $10 off 3rd purchase!

Easy to set up my sizes, petite, favorite designers and colors so my saves are tailored to me!

Reminder emails for when wan item on love list is reduced!  I know it’s to get me to shop!  I don’t enjoy walking and shopping so this app has helped me to spice up my wardrobe!",5
922,"Modern Thrifting - simple and convenient: I’m very pleased with the thredUP services and with the app/ user interface. The quality of the items is wonderful and everything feels almost new. I’ve received all my packages to date without issue. The app makes it easy to search and add to your cart, it clearly distinguishes when an item is not returnable, and the prices are reasonable. I’ve recommended this app to many of my friends and family. I prefer buying through thredUP over shopping for “fast fashion” and its now my go to when I’m looking for a specific article I need to add to my closet. Love love love!",5
923,"Support isn’t helpful: Their support tool is terrible, I just hope it isn’t intentionally so. I’ve had issues with rewards and get stuck in circles answering their robots questions. I also got a pair of pants listed for $22 as being $70+ Nine West velour pants, but when I tried them on they had a $12 sales tag from Kohl’s. I accepted that I fell for a fast one and gave up on their support tool that time, but now the rewards issue is worth $10 so I’ve lost at least $20 to thredUP. I’ve enjoyed most of my purchase but now I’d only shop here if you’re extra savvy I guess",5
924,"Great prices good options: I have been used thread up to buy clothing. Everything is wrapped lovely, clean, and comes fairly quickly in multiple shipments. Shopping the markdowns makes it even more affordable. I have had a couple issues- items that had undisclosed damage. I contacted customer service on the app using the texting - both issues were resolved quickly and to my satisfaction. 
I also have had a couple pieces - 2 NWT jackets that were part of two piece sets but that wasn’t disclosed you were only getting one of the pieces- so you are taking a bit of a risk just like any thrift store.  So far it has been a positive experience!",4
925,"Used to be awesome: I am deleting my thredup app. I used to love this online store. The prices have all gone up, and many items are not described properly. Now, we can’t return without a $1.99 fee per item. 

This is a secondhand store- some items come in poorer condition than described or are not listed with the right size. Why should customers be penalized? The restocking fee is awful.

 I have also sent out clean out bags knowing what my items were worth- I had gotten an estimate for the children’s item from consignment shop near me- but chose to go through Thredup bc I could shop for adult clothes as well as children’s clothes. What a mistake. I didn’t get anything close to what the clothes’ value was. Thredup was great. Now- it’s a total ripoff. Bought one last thing to use up my credit- but now I’m done. I will no longer be a customer.",1
926,"So disappointed 😞 use other apps: I was really excited to try this app, I have used many other shopping apps before and I really enjoy using them and then when I read about the thredUP. I was excited to try it because it just seemed so convenient to use. So I ordered my bag and I put plenty of clothes in there shirts purses, jeans.. once my bag was processed I saw that I only received $1.40 😕😕😐😐 some of the brands I put in were forever 21, h&m, Charlotte Russe, Aeropostale, and many more. I submitted “trendy” items like they stated they were accepting but I can’t believe all I’ll be getting is $1.40. I would’ve been better off selling all my items on my own. I will never be using thredUP again, not even to shop for. Id rather support someone actually wanting to clean out their closet and sell clothes to people who want them, then to be ripped off.",1
927,"Consistency issues: This app would be so much better if:

 1. One additional photo was taken to show the side view, top or bottom 

2. The damage, wear, stain should be photographed!! I don’t know what they consider minor wear, but if the item is falling apart, we don’t see eye to eye. 

3. Measure correctly, or, if you can’t, take a photo of the measuring tape up against the item 

4. Please put measurements on coats, jackets and blazers! 

 5. Too much stuff is “final sale”. With all of the mistakes that happen, there needs to be a much more liberal return policy. 

6. Quit charging restocking fees! Your gouging us for returning items that have been ill measured and in conditions not described. Thats your fault!

7. Please add a few more descriptive words to help with the search and so we are more clear about what we are getting. 

8. Lastly, just don’t sell with them EVER! I sent several bags of high brand items (free people maxi dresses NWTS, brand name dresses, pants and shorts. The best I did was about $4 on an item, and even some items I got .35 cents back for lol, what?

 -thank you, I’d love to keep thrifting in the name of Mother Earth!!!",2
928,"Dear Developers,: First, I love ThredUP. Frequent shopper, occasional seller. The platform makes it easy for me to access stylish clothing at prices that fit my budget. 

BUT, the app needs improvement. There are many features that should be available that just aren’t. Here are a few:

- Display the number of items available in a particular search. This used to be there, now it is not. Why? 

- Ability to search by more than one category. Sometimes I want to look at dresses AND tops from a certain designer at the same time.

- Don’t automatically include numberical sizes when I’m searching by S-M-L-XL. A size 8 or 12 will not fit me, but for some reason it shows up when I’m searching for L items. 

- Find similar items. It would be great if I’m looking at a red, 3/4 sleeve blouse, that I am shown other red, 3/4 sleeve blouses. 

- Ability to exclude brands. I don’t want to purchase Charlotte Russe or Forever 21 as a 30-something. It would be nice not to have those items show up in a query.",4
929,"Shopping yes! App and returns could improve: Big fan of consignment stores so love the idea of this app! There could definitely be some improvements though. When I first started using the app, I didn’t have to log in every single time and now the app logs me out super frequently, like less than an hour and the log in process doesn’t remember my email so I have to type it out every time which is relatively minor but super annoying. Returns can also be a pain due to a smaller return window, label that needs to be printed, and usps returns. Again, these things as stand alones seem small but just add up to inconveniences that make me hesitate to order things.",3
930,"Totally upset with this place: I sent a clean-out bag in back in April or May. It wasn’t until October that my items were for sale. I have had six items sold and have not received any money because it all went toward my shipping cost. I still have 12 more items to sell, and now they’re telling me that I can reclaim my items because they haven't sold in the expected time frame. I made zero dollars from my sold items because of the shipping cost from the Cleanout. Some of my items still had tags on them and were never worn. They sold my items for more than $15 and I received less than $1. I believe the next time I’ll just send my items to a secondhand shop for retail here locally in my own town. This was a total scam in my opinion. I feel used and abused.",1
931,"Not working for me: I love the concept of thread up, but there’s a number of issues and they aren’t even trying to address them. The worst is they have different people taking measurements and some measure across the front while others measure all the way around and others don’t seem to have a clue of how to measure.  They also only take 2 pics per item, so that means no pics of the inside of a purse or the bottom of shoes!   Descriptions don’t always contain fabric content and are lacking critical information such as does the garment have pockets, does the inside of the purse have a lining, etc. So u often wind up getting clothes that don’t agree to their measurements or fabric is not what you expected and returns are a hassle.",2
932,"Great!: I’m happy there is a place where I can buy second hand with companies I know. Mostly since sizing is always different from company to company. I wish recommendations were closer to to the style I’m looking for, like a fit and flare black dress, but it only shows dresses in black and not the same style. Though I don’t think there is a robotic algorithm that can replace human eyes. But you think they would like could recommend clothes from similar companies. Yet all and all I’ll still use thred up if Depop or Poshmark don’t have what I’m looking for at a cheap price.",5
933,"Room for Improvement: First off, offer better shipping options. Fed Ex is almost never on time and your site doesn’t always give the most updated information. UPS and USPS give way better service. 

Second, your descriptions are not good. You need to give more information and point out details that aren’t noticeable in the picture. Example: I bought a tshirt that had a zipper on the shoulder that was not visible in the picture and no mention of it in the description. You would cut down on your returns. Another example: I was interested in a teal sweater with polka dots. What color are the dots? It is sometimes hard to distinguish between navy and black and again, too little detail in the description. I ended up not buying. 

That being said, you do have some very good quality items and a very good selection of items. It’s a great concept that can be vastly improved with better customer service. 

So far I have had no issues with returns and that is the only reason I continue to shop with you over Poshmark.",3
934,"Frustrating descriptions: The app it’s self is not terrible. The bingo card pops up every time I log in even though the promotions are over.  Also pops up when changing screens. annoying but passable. It’s the descriptions and the size filtering. Even though I have saved “all my sizes” and just purchased a skirt it is child size. There is a difference between size 20 and an 20” waist. There is also a difference between child’s leggings and active wear leggings. Petite jeans and reg or tall. Just put it in the description!  The amount of things I have wasted money on is not decreasing any footprint if it cost so much for restocking and mailing fees to send back.  it gets thrown away. Have I gotten a few good pieces yes, but more than 50% ordered was trash.",2
935,"Search engine broken. Orders take weeks.: ThredUP used to be great but has some serious issues these days.

1. The search engine straight up doesn't work. It will return the whole site sorted by relevance if you search for anything other than a brand; and even then it is case sensitive. You can only click on suggested searches and then proceed by filtering. It's bonkers to me that they haven't fixed this. 

2. The order processing times have gotten out of hand. It takes several days, sometimes weeks for an order to even ship.

3. The item processing is low quality and leads to a lot of inaccuracies on the site. In recent months I've received items that are completely the wrong size, brand, or in terrible condition relative to what was listed. One pair of shoes was literally broken in half, and not in a way that could have happened during transit. 

4. Don't even bother sending in clothes right now. The last box I sent in took 4+ months to process. 

I like what thredUP is trying to do as a company but it's worse than just going to my local Salvation Army at this point.",2
936,"Comeback: I haven’t been on thred up for a while and I wish I had been on because I love this site it’s convenient and it has a lot of things that I am interested in. I will remember to only use this when purchasing clothing that I need because I can’t afford anything else, except maybe Old Navy. Cheers to thred up. 
I have one complaint it’s not that easy to communicate and many times when I read the size of some thing the measurements don’t match at all. I tried to go through customer service chat and he told me what to do to let you know but there is no item number., To let you know.",4
937,"Great concept, buggy app: I love thredup and now buy all my clothes from this company. However, the app has been buggy lately. Examples: I keep getting a popup telling me to double tap to favorite an item, but then the popup won’t go away no matter where I tap, and I have to restart the app to get it to go away. I’ve been trying to contact customer service about an order that is late, but every time, the app gets stuck on the screen that says something like, “We’ll connect you to an available channel.” I really need help with my order, but the app won’t connect me to customer service.",4
938,"If only I could search for animal prints: I mean full animals, not like... cat print or zebra. I’m talking unicorns on dresses (yeah, I found one!) or little happy monkeys (yep, got one of those too!) or my bird dress! Maybe with that feature I’d have less dresses, because it’s searching for those that has helped me find some of my absolute favorite dresses. From Betsey Johnson to ModCloth, brilliant brands, well made brands that last, often for under $20! It takes some time, but it’s fun to be able to search specific fits and brands, even specific categories! 
If you’re on the fence, TRY THIS APP!!",5
939,"Great source for a variety of secondhand: The app is simple to use and has many awesome features such as shopping similar items, saving searches and favorite items and shopping by seller. 

The downsides include: the content  for plus size shoppers. Limited stylish options and the see similar items doesn’t usually work with plus items. Additionally, images showing a garment from more angles would be helpful, as well as showing the stains/wear more explicitly so the buyer can decide for themselves how to fix it. Also! Better shoe pictures, similar to how TheRealReal does it would be helpful, as well as information on how a brand “runs to size.”",4
940,"The obsession is real.: I NEVER leave reviews but honestly, I am absolutely obsessed with this company and app (or maybe I just have a shopping problem). 

The app is super easy to navigate and well thought out. I save all my searches so I can immediately go into the app, select my saved searches and find my favorite brands/styles so easily. I have never had an issue with returns and everything has always come exactly as described. 

If you are someone who loves thrifting, you will love ThredUP! It’s so satisfying to get great pieces at such a low cost and they are always running deals. Half of my wardrobe is from thredUP.",5
941,"Love this App!: I love thredUP. Here are a few of my favorite things about them: You can browse thousands of brands at one time. I discover brands I didn’t know I loved each time I use the app. I heart the item and keep shopping. The prices are usually great and they always offer great discounts! They have great inventory and excellent customer service! 

The few things I dislike: I feel the descriptions could be more specific. For example, I find it hard to shop for boots (ex: circumference is not included in descriptions).  I’m not a fan of the 12 or 1 hour cart. With a busy schedule sometimes I only have time to browse and I’ll go back to cart and everything has been removed. This is very frustrating since I like to buy multiple things and need time to browse. Which brings me to my last dislike, I have yet to find an easy way to browse different items at once (ex: purses and tops only). 

Happy Customer!

942,"Great secondhand option: I love thrifting and shopping secondhand and thredUP is a great way to do that online. Most items I’ve bought have been in great condition. Sometimes details are hard to see in the pictures, but when I am not satisfied with an item or it doesn’t fit, returns have been easy and straightforward. I usually just return with a free shipping label for store credit because I know I’ll buy from them again. The key is to check the app regularly because items go fast. The best part is that I’ve gotten some expensive pieces in great condition for a fraction of the cost!",5
943,"Easy to Use: For those of us who live in an expensive city, it can be almost impossible to find a good used clothing store. The rent is just too expensive! I like this app because I can get free shipping with a bundle of items, rather than paying for shipping on individual items from individual sellers. And it allows me to shop for used clothes without driving far out to an actual shop. I’ve had a few items that didn’t match their description when they arrived or that I liked less in person, but returns were really easy to do through the mail.",5
944,"Expensive Goody Box Lesson Learned: At first I was excited at trying thredUP for the first time. 
I decided to order a Custom Goody Box. After 3 months of waiting I finally receive my first box on Dec. 9th. Same time I’d also left town. So by the time I return home from my trips, I have a chance to look at clothes. Honestly, only one item actually fit me. They were All way too small. Missed sized or something because I’m an 8 in every brand I’ve ever tried anywhere with only slight variations in cuts and fits. Never do I try on an 8 & can’t button it or breath as it was with these. 
Also the quality & style of these clothes were awful. Way out of style & just ugly.
Needless to say.....$461 later and no new clothes to me that fit, I will not do it again. 
After finally getting app to work & find how to return, I’d emailed thredUP about my wanting to return etc, expecting some type of reply. Nothing. After waiting for a reply, they finally show my order but app says no return possible now. 
Thanks for the reply, not, & for finally showing my order on account to tell me I am unable to return. 
Oh but hey.....I can sell it all back to them with a payout of up to 40% of what I paid, or less.  Sheesh.....",1
945,"Transformed my closet: I’ve been using ThredUP for several years now. I love fashion and the prices are so good it allows me to change my wardrobe frequently. The selection is unbelievable. I get complimented all the time. I’ve recommended ThredUP to all my friends and have even given gift certificates for presents. Easy to buy, easy to return. My one suggestion, and I have asked for this repeatedly, is a filter for sleeve length in dresses. I don’t buy strapless, sleeveless, or short-sleeved clothing due to being self conscious, so it would save me from wasting a LOT of time searching.",5
946,"Love the Company; app can use some tweaks: I’ve been buying and selling with ThredUp for over two years. As an eco-conscious, budget-friendly, fashion enthusiast this is the best digital option for buying ‘used’ clothes from a company. Compared to PoshMark or eBay, I have much more confidence in the quality of clothes I buy with ThredUp since they go through inspections AND they have a great return policy! Win-win. They do offer less for clothing purchase than brick and mortar options like CrossRoads, however it’s more convenient and they buy a lot more of my clothes on average. My only feedback is the search functionality/ metadata capability of the app can use some work.",4
947,"A thrifter’s dream!: I LOVE this app! I started using it summer 2021 as a solution to not being able to go thrifting in person as often due to COVID. I’ve continued to make several orders since and feel it is now a staple in my clothing shopping habits. I love the filters and sorting to help find exactly what I’m looking for. So many items I’ve found have become favorite go-to’s in my wardrobe. Right out of college and starting my career as a teacher, it also helped me find professional clothing from brands I wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford. I am obsessed!",5
948,"Why bother selling & buying anything less than “like new”?: I recently wrote a long review. After reading through other reviewers, the biggest complaints 
seemed to be in the lower tier merchandise
below “like new” with mystery stains; worn surface; etc.

Why even bother with “gently used” items that lead to too many returns over no detailed info or images of where the defects are located on an item. 

Negative reviews focused on return fees.
Seems silly to return $5.00 item will incurring a restocking & shipping fee. Maybe just offer points for buyer’s donating low tier items not worth mailing back to the company. Better yet, why
even bother selling crap.  

Other negative reviews are on over-priced used items. Competitive online clothing sites do often have much better merchandise and comparably pricing with sale discounts; esp. Gilt; Nordstrom Rack. 

Hope all this helps! I absolutely love most items I purchased from ThreadUp!!!

949,"Love buying, love selling!: Thredup is the place i go... umm, daily :) .... to score goodies from basics to luxury, and to sell same.  Its all here! Its fair - once u study their payouts and 'get' that u wont make a ton on basics, yet basics are so reasonable that u can basically trade your basics for other basics! You can make a very nice amount on high end items, and you have some control over pricing.  If there's a problem, they are also great.  They dont do everything that other sites do like provide tons of pics... but they do enough which = awesomeness.  Go. Buy. Sell. Enjoy. Recycled fashion - go team!",5
950,"Streamlined but needs more options: First of all, “pocketed” should be an option in features. I understand that it’s hard to go back and add it to all the items they have in stock but I want to know if the tunic I’m buying actually has pockets or is just stitched like that in the photos.

Secondly, Petites has fewer catagoriyan than Women. I really want to just look up jumpsuits under Petites but I have to search the keyword, which means I’m not able to select for inseam size.

Other than those two things, I like that they recycle items they won’t take and that there’s a bundling option for when I buy multiple things over the same week.",4
951,"Sellers: This is an awesome concept. I love how they display your items fir you and send them to butsers. Unlike Poshmark; you have to take the pictures and mail the items yourself but what I don’t like is the price that you’re items are being listed for. Even items that Tae new with tags and prices cheap, so you’re not making much money. The items you don’t claim can be returned but I feel like the amount they charge to send back items you don’t sell is a bit unreasonable to where it’s really not worth asking for them back. And I know the developer is going to respond with that same generic response, but you guys should really read beyond the 5 star reviews and make a few adjustments. 🙂",3
952,"Honestly amazing: I never really write reviews for apps, but since I can’t leave reviews in the app, I thought I’d give it a go. I’ve only ordered once and so far two of my four packages have arrived and I love every piece so far. Everything is like the picture, no damage, measurements are correct, and are overall excellent quality for secondhand clothing. Although every piece so far has the same smell of what reminds me of a “grandmas house”. Nothing one wash couldn’t fix. I love everything and will be buying again soon. :) Definitely recommend.",5
953,"Guilty pleasure: Seriously the BEST shopping app I have ever used. Plus, I’m all for second hand shopping! Recycling clothing just makes sense. I received my first order promptly and the items met the expectations made in the app. 

My only negative is that I ordered a clean out bag back in December, and never received it. Could have been a postal service mishap... either way I was prepared to do some serious spring cleaning. Just today I ordered two more clean out kits and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that he kits make it. 

Otherwise! Great app, great shopping experience, and I recommend this to all of my family and friends.",5
954,"♥️♥️♥️: I had weight loss surgery 3 years ago, and when I lost weight enough that my original clothing started to look ridiculously big (yay!), I began shopping at Target and places like that for a little more inexpensive alternatives. Then I discovered ThredUP! It was such a good place to send clothes that I was going to donate anyway, and I was able to purchase myself some clothes that 3 years ago  I never thought I would actually be wearing! As the weight continues to come off, I have started keeping things I buy. It has been fun to be able to wear cute clothes again, and I will continue to shop ThredUP!",5
955,"Honestly a little scammy: I think it’s frankly a little deceitful they don’t explain before you send clothes in how bad the payout rate is. It feels a little scammy. They’re preying off the assumption of when you see the prices that you’ll get a reasonable percentage rather than maybe 5%. Additionally, their whole deal is that they’re helping the environment by reducing clothes waste, but what do they do with the clothes they deem unsellable? I would’ve donated those clothes to Goodwill instead so they could help people instead of (likely) being thrown out by this place. Or donating it to an actual charity if I had had more information about it. I think they’re just another bad company going under the guise of helping people when they’re just looking for a profit. Either donate your clothes somewhere else or sell it on poshmark. This ain’t it.",1
956,"Love the Service - 1 Complaint: I try to order sustainable materials only (cotton, hemp, linen, etc) but the materials listed for each garment aren’t always accurate - I’ve ordered what is said to be a 100% cotton garment and received a 60% polyester garment instead. Polyester is non-biodegradable, so I prefer never to buy any clothing made with that or other harmful materials. If the service could be more accurate on materials then I would gladly give them 5 stars!

Edit: this review was written a couple years ago when I first started using thread up and hasn’t been addressed. I’m getting frustrated ordering what is supposed to be cotton and having to return a polyester/rayon item of clothing. It clearly says on the tag what the material is.",3
957,"I always check here first: I’m inspired by vintage clothing. Every time I want to purchase an item of clothing, I always check out ThredUp first as they have everything! Also, their prices are the best compared to other secondhand websites! I’m very classic in the way I dress so I know every item I purchase will stay in my closet for years to come. Also, buying secondhand is way better for the environment than buying brand new and I can even find the trendy pieces too that I can add to modernize the classic pieces in my closet for way less than purchasing retail",5
958,"Favorite shopping app!: I love the selection and ease of use. I do have a couple problems though, one being that I have used the refer a friend option and I never received what they say you will after they make their first purchase, basically I think they lie to get more people to use it. My other problem is you get points for shopping but every time you use the points you have to start over, I’ve never made it past $5 off because as soon as I use it I have to start all over again earning points, but if you try to save them they eventually expire.",4
959,"Scam: If I could give zero stars I would. If I could give negative stars, that would be even better. I sent a clean out kit to them in July. I emailed them a couple months later and asked why I hadn’t been paid and they told me I’d get paid by December 1st. December 12th rolls around and I realized I haven’t gotten paid. I emailed them again and asked why. They sent an automated response saying they would respond within 8 days. 9 days pass and still no response so I emailed them again and went a little Karen on them but everything I said was factual. The clean out kits are such a scam and joke as well as this company. I want my money please. I am a college student with no job. You guys are evil. If I had read these horrible reviews about your clean out kits, I would’ve sold my stuff on Depop.",1
960,"Buy but don’t sell.: Environmentally, I love the mission of Thred up.  I will continue to buy there, but I will never sell there again. 

Over the course of a few months, I sent 4 huge boxes of my clothes and children’s clothes.  Only a small potion of the items were selected for sale (one box only one item was chosen).  From there only 13 items sold and I only made $16 total.     

This was my experience, it is not worth it to me and I personally feel as though the company takes advantage of its sellers.  You can draw your own conclusions.",5
961,I’ve been with thredUP for six years and really enjoyed them up until this last week: Their new point system is awful they took all your points away and they make it cost twice as much to get $10 off and you can’t get a percentage off handbags anymore I am not going to be shopping with them very much from now on and I have spent thousands upon thousands with them. They have just lost a very very good customer. Plus the last shipment I received was extremely poorly packed they just took all my items and threw them in a box that I didn’t even know was from thredUP.,4
962,"Amazing!: I absolutely love this site! There’s so many different options for how you can receive clothes! The prices are super good and there’s almost always an extra discount! It’s super cool because it also lets you know when items you like are discounted for even more and their rewards system is one of the best! Would highly recommend this site to anyone looking to update their wardrobe on a budget!! PLUS you can sell/donate your old clothes that you don’t wear anymore, just send them the kit and they take care of the rest! Super easy, efficient, and great for the environment!",5
963,"Great site, great ethics: We need so see more companies pushing sustainable practices like thredup. On top of their great and environmentally friendly practices, the site and the app are easy to navigate and the selection is fantastic. All of the items I have ordered have been exactly as described, and the three pieces that I have returned have been processed quickly and easily. I received credit in return for those returns and it was applied to my account automatically and easy to use on my next purchase. Can’t wait to continue to buy from thredup- saving money and the environment one order at a time.",5
964,"What a nightmare: I’ve purchased a few things from ThredUp and that experience was fine. Selling is another experience. They allow returns, and the return rate is way too high. As of late, they have made some changes. I now have to wait until an item is within 7 days of ending in order to reclaim it. Well, they also “pause” your consignment period time while a purchased item is out for delivery. If it gets returned, your consignment period on that item resumes. This results in ending times of items to be very staggered. They charge you $6 per cart of reclaims, so now that my items are being held hostage up until 7 days of ending, I’m basically spending all of my earnings to get my unsold items back. I’m done with ThredUp, both for buying and selling. There are plenty of other options out there.",1
965,Love it: Love the app I think I’ve been using it for over two years now. The only thing I don’t like is the recent-ish change where carts are only 4 hours! I’m a browser and sometimes I mix around a few items before I decide exactly on what I’m getting. My heart list is long and I like to be able to sort it all. Like I’ve used the bundle where I buy one thing one day then another the next but I like being able to think about it over night or something. I don’t mind the short carts on days where it’s a sale but not during a regular period. I haven’t been able to buy things in months because if I find something I really like during lunch and put it in my cart. By the time I get off work it’s already out of my cart and someone else bought it.,1
966,"Good Thrift Store: This is great thrift store. Many clothes are in great condition. BE AWARE!!! However I have send two bags of clean out clothes to them and they didn’t list all the items nor did they inform me why the items not listed were not listed. It good me a little while to contact them because they don’t make it easy. I chatted with a representative name Richard about this matter and he continues to say that they don’t inform customer of items not listed or provide options to have the item return unless it’s paid in advance when order the clean out bag. The item was a 100% leather backpack which I only used twice. I bought it in a impulse. 
I asked for a supervisor but I haven’t heard from anyone yet.",3
967,"Excellent way to thrift!: ThredUP is amazing. You get all the brands and price savings you find with other online thrift options, with the convenience of dealing with a single seller that takes returns. A couple of small things prevent me from giving 5 stars: the quality of the photos isn’t always great. It’s frequently hard to see details and they offer only two photos (front and back). Also, the quality of the descriptions are hit or miss. Sometimes things are miscategorized or poorly described. But if you know your brands, you can come away with some real steals.",5
968,"App great selling still waiting buying great: The app is awesome. So easy to use. I love that i can favorite things and if they sell before I buy them I can unfavorite them. I love the search and filter it makes searching so easy. 

The buying process is awesome I love getting good quality items cheep and have been loving opening the packages with cute packaging. 

The process for selling could be quicker, Bag was sent on 2/6 and I am still waiting almost a month later for it to even be processing. It makes me not want to source and send in items. Hopefully I will be happier once the steps continue.",5
969,"I don’t know why this app irks me so...: UPDATE: They also sell some of your items on EBAY with free shipping. They have their software connected to EBAY so if you add the item to your cart on ThredUP it will become unavailable on EBAY. I asked them about this via chat and yet to receive a response on why they are selling our items on EBAY as well.  

(Buffalo Exchange has a delivery bag option, will look into that and keep ppl updated)

Anddd went from great to okay... I’m annoyed I never had time to adjust the prices of my items and now they are in people’s carts since they were received a few days ago. I checked every day when I could adjust them. This morning they were unavailable to adjust. 

They don’t measure each clothing item 

For now they don’t offer free returns 

The return from sales for resellers isn’t worth it tbh. Basically pennies for an outfit. Also the price for some items is meh.

They need a vintage section. 

Too much unloading of LulaRoe from ppl(pyramid scheme brand)

Wish there were more options to find cooler items, like actually going to a thrift store.",3
970,"Good overall: I like ThredUP overall. I like buying used for environmental reasons and it’s good for a limited budget too. 
I did find that the search engine was not super accurate and would like to see that upgraded. I also felt the quality of the photos for many prints was blurred and colors were not clearly depicted. 
For example, a top looking black but luckily glancing down seeing it listed as green. Or, a sweater that looked like a plain grey knit but upon looking at the item description it’s listed as animal print. 
I should note I have great eyesight, in case that’s a question.
Overall ThredUP was a good experience, I would just like to see some improvements in those areas in the future to give a 5 star review.",3
971,"Fabulous!: I have bought and sold through ThredUP now over this past one year period of time. The business I have done through my items sold has been smooth and fair turnover. I also feel that the clothing options they have, what I have purchased, and the actual shopping/shipping experience has been fabulous and I continue to come back and purchase more! I love it! It’s way better than having to go to a clothing store and shopping sales! I can do it on the couch in my own home and be confident that what I am purchasing is what I will receive with condition and size!",5
972,"Awesome: The app is so excellent. I hate shopping; ‘hated’  shopping, I should say, now that I found Thred Up. Now I can save my favorites, sort through what I really need and really want. I’m a processer, so this app is perfect for me. The bundles are a great option too. I’ve been telling so many people about it! You just have to figure out your brands and sizes. If you have to talk to them, don’t email. That’s a black hole. Just get on the chat during office hours. It takes a bit and is slightly annoying, but they are nice. Overall - 5 stars anyways. Love it!",5
973,"Disappointed: I am very disappointed with thredUP currently. I placed an order earlier this week, and immediately after I hit order I noticed that I had typed my address in wrong, it was off by one number. So I immediately contacted customer support asking them to change it. I did not hear from them until the next day when they said they couldn’t change it because it had already shipped. Which it had not, and I told them that. I said I needed the address changed or the order canceled. They said they couldn’t do anything once the label had been made. That is unacceptable and I will probably not be ordering from them ever again. So buyers beware, customer service will not help you out at all even if you contact them immediately!",1
974,"Not worth it anymore: I used to love this app. I never ordered anything on it but I would clean out mine, my mom’s, and my niece’s closets using the clean out bags. The bag’s used to be free to order, fill, and send back. Now you have to pay a minimum of $18 for a bag and $15 for a “free” shipping label. You’re not even guaranteed to make that much back. I averaged about $6-8 when I filled up a bag. The last few times I sent a bag in I made anywhere from $10-20 but they took about $16 out even though when I ordered the bag they were still sending them out for free. Total waste of time and a scam now. Customer service? It doesn’t exist with these people. You’re better off with Poshmark or another site/app or just taking your stuff to local goodwill and getting a donation receipt.",1
975,"Makes thrifting so easy! App can be glitchy: I don’t have much patience when it comes to shopping in stores, but apparently can scroll for hours shopping on Thredup! Second hand clothes are displayed just like any online store, making it easy to see what you’re getting. You can filter by condition also which is particularly helpful when you can’t look at the clothes in person. Good prices compared to the original and lots of great sales on top of that. The app can be pretty glitchy, taking a while to load or failing altogether sometimes, but when it works it’s great.",4
976,"Love it: I am very much satisfied with the product I love all of my orders. The only thing I don’t like the delivery service.  Very very slow!!!  I think they should approve themselves with faster delivery!!!
It’s almost a joke. All of my orders was sitting in different warehouses in different places for days. starting  for Georgia and then it sits in West Virginia for a couple of days and it sits in Maryland for a couple of days and then finally arrives days later when it was promised. I will keep using them but I have to think months ahead or sometimes seasons I had to get all of the products in time when I need it",4
977,Great prices slow shipping: I love buying second hand items and this site has so much to choose from.  My daughter and I have both ordered items as well as goody boxes and loved them. However they use a fedex service that  fedex subcontracts out. While thread up ships it out in a reasonable amount of time this shipping service takes around two weeks to deliver items. The driver told us that the reason we didn’t get our package Tuesday was the driver didn’t know the area same driver on Thursday said he had no idea where the package was. It is a really poor delivery service.,5
978,"Someone take this app away from me!: I have been using this app for only a few months and I have already bought more here than on other sites. The items are fairly priced and the selection is huge! I just wish the items were described in more detail rather than just separated into filtered categories— makes it impossible to search for really specific items. Still, its just irresistible! Never tried the clean out kit, but the goody box was such a creative and fun thing to do. Got some good items out of it and was generally really excited by it.",5
979,"AWFUL FEES: If you take a bit of time and compare their prices with the actual store price, it’s not that great of a deal. Example: I love Lulus and saw a cute black dress on there for $45. I was about to buy it but then I noticed a few things.
1. Shipping is $5.99 unless you spend over $74 (or somewhere around there)
2. If you return the item, they charge a $1.99 restock fee
3. (The worst) If you want to return something and receive the original payment and not store credit, they charge you $8.99!!!
There are things on there for less than $10 so if you choose to return it, you are literally LOSING money. As for the dress, it’s only $10 more on Lulus site which I would get free shipping and free returns and would not be charged a ridiculous fee to get my money back.",2
980,"Definitely Worth the Effort: If you don’t mind viewing sometimes thousands of items (good or bad thing depending on your patience), you WILL find a great item or 5 for an even better price. Definitely an upgrade from scrolling eBay for second hand, only to find maybe it is/maybe it isn’t the exact item you’ll get in like new or brand new condition. For the cost conscious minded persons, who still like the trending clothes lines, this is the stop for you. The tv commercials maybe cheesy and overstate the bottom line, but every word is true. Great clothes, work/casual/evening dining, for a good bargain.",5
981,"Need Updates: I love the concept but I will have to agree with another reviewer that the styles are geared towards older working adults and can sometimes be way overpriced. I also wish you offered pictures that would allow us to see some of the defects of certain items. Try using better descriptions rather than a template for each item. 

I recently purchased a swimsuit that was listed under size 10. When I received the item the tag said US 10, UK 10, MX 10. These are clearly not the same sizes and someone should have recognized this before posting. The swimsuit actually looks like a 4T and unfortunately I’m not able to return it. 

Again great concept but needs work.",3
982,"Great App. Good idea. Not executed Well.: All the clothes I have bought have been great. Only one or two wrong items. Including buying what I thought was a women's coat coming to my house as a Large Child's coat. 

Also the way this company ""reserves"" things for other customers is crazy to me. You have 24 hours to buy it once it's in your cart. Yet the things I want or am watching always stay reserved for days or even a week at one point. I'm all for a deal but atleast make it fair. They need a new system for that part. 

Great clothes and okay company. Delivery is always nice. And returns aren't bad even if atlittle overpriced. 8/10 I would recommend to my mother.",4
983,"Yeah, I’m out....: After two years of buying thousands of dollars of stuff, I’m over it. I’ve seen several items from Target, Forever 21, JCP, etc priced way higher on here used than they were retail. I don’t understand who is making these prices up and why they have no knowledge of brands and pricing. Shipping takes FOREVER. Several times they couldn’t even find the items I had already paid for and had to refund me. One customer service rep straight up told me it’s horribly disorganized. I dealt with all that because I loved being able to shop from my phone. But a lot of times their sizing is off or it doesn’t look like the picture, so being able to return stuff was nice....and now there’s a restocking fee?!?! $1.99 per item, seriously? Lol no. Plenty of other similar apps that don’t charge so I’ll pass.",1
984,Amazing Online Thrifting: The app is well organized and makes finding items you’re interested in easy. You have the ability to save items you are interested in as well as save searches you want to keep an eye on. It’s a great place to find amazing deals on used clothing without breaking the bank. The site is also informational about some great ways to reduce your clothing waste and offers many options for shipping. If you’re looking for an online thrifting shop this is an amazing place to start!,5
985,"Good selection, some recent changes that aren’t so great.: I usually shop on Thread Up and routinely return bags for resell. It used to be better I feel like. Now returns cause you to lose your points, and you lose money on them with restock and other fees. The payouts are pretty low now and you have to pay if you want a clean out bag. Unfortunately there is a lot of Shein junk in stock now too, so you have to sort it out. 
I still will keep shopping here, I prefer secondhand and I can get nicer clothes with little wear at a good price. Just know it’s not perfect and it’s better for buying than selling.",4
986,"Good luck - expect to wait 6months+: Having been a long time supporting and user I can no longer recommend this company or app. Clean out bags are taking 6months or longer to process , order tracking doesn’t work, no live support just a AI chat bot that is a joke. Also they no longer send the clean out bags for free shipping. 

They have created like 2-3 dupe accounts a new one with each clean out order so I don’t collect the points I’m owed and good luck getting that fixed… donate to local shelters, dress for success, the real real for “good stuff” sorry but Coach and Kate spade are not considered designer and if there are over 1,000 of them its because the quality and value isn’t there… this business model is crashing.",2
987,"I don’t miss the crowded malls and trying to find a parking spot.: I love this site. I’m very impressed with the visual description of every item. The site is so easy to navigate and the rewards for purchases and referrals add up. The clean out process is just as easy, even though you really have to be patient because it takes time to receive and get your items up for sale, but they’re just hanging in your closet anyway, so no worries on that aspect. 
Love it. Have purchased so many name brand items for a fraction of their original cost.",5
988,"The retail world: While it is nice to have a shopping site 
they really need to work on a few things
First with the retail world the way it is NO one
pays full retail for anything anymore 
So to use full retail pricing for starting points us a little bit ridiculous 
Second you need to show pictures of the interior of handbags, corners,all damage and list missing straps. After all your going off of the whole retail price so all parts and damage should be accounted for.
Next you need to have a course in how to handle luxury items 
I myself I ordered Louis Vuitton from you only to receive it all folded up and with permanent fold lines! I even contacted Louis Vuitton for help and I wasn’t spending more money for your mistake 
NOT GOOD!
I was very disappointed and unhappy with your lack of customer satisfaction with my problem and I’m sure I’m not the only one if you are continuing to ship luxury items this way
Yes I know you handle thousands of items but purses is a different market and should be handled accordingly to be fair to your consumer",3
989,It’s ok: It’s still a good place to buy items and find something different that might not be available in your area. You have to be sure that you do your search so that you don’t see items with stains or rips because they will sell them even though they don’t give payouts to people for those type of items. The last bag I sent took almost four months to be processed and so of course are not in season so I most likely will get next to nothing for them. I will still purchase but very carefully and will not send anything. I can donate to a local thrift store and help my area if I don’t care about getting anything in return.,3
990,"Need more info on items: I really liked Thredup at first and have made a lot of purchases using their app. Then it became more items I could not use because the measurements weren’t the same as similar items labeled the same size. I have found that I must have measurements because the label may say it is my size, but that does not mean that it will fit. And it is too costly to return the items. Although I have seen quite a few skirts that I like, I will not purchase skirts because the waist measurement is not given, only the length; both are important. There needs to be some improvements. I don’t even recommend it to anyone anymore.",3
991,App Filters & Shipping are Issues: The app filters do not allow you to target down to specifics in categories. With the large inventory this can be challenging. For best results know the designers you would like to look for. The BIGGEST reason for a 2 star rating is the shipping combined with customer service. Do NOT rely on the tracking you get in the app. It will be off by a week or more. The”fedex” tracking is not reality. The package is shipped in the cheapest possible way meaning delays and transfers to USPS. I have waited 20+ days for items to arrive. The customer service is almost impossible to contact and unapologetic nor helpful. The deals are only worth it if you can wait a month or more to get your items.,2
992,"Perfect for my needs: It’s not only a great way to acquire quality goods for a good price while helping with  reuse and repurposing of clothes, they help alleviate hesitation to get rid of things one truly does not need or want anymore but feel bad getting rid of them because they are yet in great condition. 

The app is very helpful in narrowing choices to what one really wants and so far as the condition of the purchases are, they are on point. When they say “Like New,” it is on point. These clothes are in better condition than shopping off the rack where they have been tried on by other shoppers.",5
993,"Don’t spend more than $10 on an item: Well, I just received and reviewed my most recent order. This is the last time I will be ordering. ThreadUp’s idea of slightly worn, looks like new, is quite different than mine. I just paid $25 for a sweater that quote “looks like new.” It had a food stain, snag and  small hole. I spent a half hour trying to sweater shave it.
I thought the concept was a great idea. I love to borrow clothes from my girlfriends.  If I received my old clothes in this condition I would question their hygiene. 
My last shipment had a Calvin Klein shirt that said “slightly worn”. When I opened it it had a dye stain a crossed it from washing. Who would wear a shirt with a dye stain across the front of it? That isn’t a matter of taste that is a garment that has been damaged 
Descriptions are very very off. Returning this item and closing my account",1
994,"Too Disappointed: I had a few hicks with this company before and this time it has gotten even worse. I ordered a bundle order but just gotten one shirt instead of two. It said that I received my orders and it showed only one package came , I contacted them twice without no communications back. It’s sad that you can’t really speak to a real person instead. Their customer service is ATROCIOUS!!!! I should’ve left them alone a long time ago even though I bought great items... I am disappointed how this has happened to me!!!!!!!",5
995,"LOVE: This is my new favorite way to buy clothing. I can use the filters to get my search down to exactly what I’m looking for and prices are so affordable. I like to change up my wardrobe a lot and this makes it easy and inexpensive and I’m still getting quality clothing from brands I wear. If you are sending in a clean-out kit, remember first and foremost that thredUP is a BUSINESS. They need to make a profit, so you may not get as much money as you expect. Despite that, I still love buying from ThredUP and it makes me excited to participate in sustainable fashion.",5
996,"Horrible for sellers: This is the actual worst app I have ever had for selling clothing items. I sent in three HUGE bags full of nice quality clothing. They sold a free people sweater that the tags on it, originally priced $228, for $8 and I got hardly any of the “payout”. Along with unfairly pricing the items, they lost almost an entire bags worth of clothing. A third thing that they do terribly wrong is when it comes to get your payout from what you’ve sold, the PayPal link on the app does not actually work so you then have to wait to speak with an online representative over a chat platform and that takes sometimes hours and they will then manually transfer the money into your account. This app is a complete scam. Look up reviews on the internet before you use it and be very cautious if you are using this to sell clothing.",1
997,"I’m telling all my friends and coworkers: Since I’ve found Thred up I’ve had so many complement on my outfits. I love to shop consignment but with a full time job, two little kids, and a disabled mom I rarely have an afternoon to drive around shopping. It’s also hard for me to find sizes that fit me well. Thred up has made it so no matter the time of day if I have a few moments I can peruse the app and find amazing treasures. My only hang up is that men’s clothes are not included so unfortunately my partner is left out, but I can shop away for my girls and myself!! Definitely two thumbs up!!",5
998,"A nice option with qualifiers: Some of the items are really great and a good price. Sizing isn’t always accurate so it’s a bit of a gamble if you aren’t familiar with the brand’s sizing. I have found the prices high compared to what they offer the seller, but it is a positive for environmental shoppers, so that may offset the difference. The shipping cost is steep, however the ability to “bundle and save” can be helpful if you are planning to do shopping over some days, and as always the carbon footprint of shipping is part of the calculation.  Overall it’s a good place to shop if you want a lot of selection and you don’t have time for your local shops.",4
999,"DO NOT SELL your items here: If you are trying to make some money from selling some of your unused clothes DO NOT use this app. I recommend Mercari instead. 

ThredUP customer service is horrible/non existent. I sent items to sell and they never told me how to manage the items on the app or when they ever arrived. Then they take almost ALL the money. A jacket I was selling for $12 I would only receive $1 for it! Your items can expire and if your items do not “sell” they basically take them to “donate” or sell for themselves. If you try to reclaim your items back THEY make you pay for it, just horrible. 

I truly feel like it’s a scam and I will never be using this again. If you just want a place to donate your clothes then just ship that to them, however if you’re trying to make some money DO NOT USE.",1
1000,"Love ThredUP: I discovered ThredUP when I got pregnant and was looking for affordable ways to buy nice maternity clothes. I’ve placed several orders now and love the clothes, app, and experience. The clothes have always been in great condition and look like they do in the site photos, and returns are free and super easy. I just placed my first order for baby clothes! I think ThredUP would be awesome for any and all purchases, but I am particularly excited that for pregnancy and kids clothes, when we outgrow them so quickly, there is such an awesome option. There are also always promo codes for discounts which is lovely.",5
1001,So disappointed. Item is not as described twice now: I love buying consignment clothes. And at first I thought this website was amazing they gave great descriptions had a decent amount of clothes for a good price I thought. My first order was good I was happy. My second and third order however I was disappointed. One item from each was not as described one had a hole the size of at least a quarter and since it was a knit sweater it was quickly turning into a hole the size of a baseball. Second I just ordered a bathing suit top and it was described as you might mistake it is new but it had ink stains all over the breast when it arrived. After washing it it didn’t come out at all. So I’m very disappointed in their descriptions of clothes and then arriving not in that condition.,2
1002,"Awesome used clothing site: Best deals ever. You need to savvy though. Be smart, be quick but really be aware. There are a few categories that get mixed together. Lands End and LLBean sizes for children get mixed into adult sizing. That really bugs me. Also a new feature, returns sometimes you get credit-not full, but almost, instead of sending it back. I'm getting used to that. Also there is a serious measurement issue. Some measure flat and not circumference and that causes issues with sizing. I google products size charts when in question",5
1003,"Sent to wrong address, unable to fix: I’m highly disappointed, as I just paid for a shipment that went to an old address out of state. You are unable to change or cancel an order once you submit it. I contacted the help center twice. By the time I heard back from them the package had already been delivered and I was told to get USPS to reroute it. However, it can’t be rerouted once delivered...those people just got free clothes. 
I will not use again. You can’t even changed your information on the app, I’m assuming you have to use the desktop version to do this. 

I recommend this company allow you an easy way to change your address, to give you an option to review the order and address before the final confirmation...and/or to allow you to pick out of a list of saved addresses.",1
1004,"Love the clothes and prices!: I do love the clothes and I do love the prices. My one complaint is the sizing. I know sizes are not universal, they differ from designer and brand. Sometimes I think the measurements are a little off. I do like when you give fabric details and the measurements of the mannequin that the article of clothing is on. But when I see something that says XL or XXL and the chest measurement reads 15 to 20 something inches it makes me wonder if it was measured correctly. I do place close attention to the fabric details and measurements before I purchase. I have found some really cute clothing at great prices.",4
1005,"So easy to use- and great deals: ThredUP has just enough search engine bells and whistles that I can narrow down my search just perfectly. I also like the “more items from this seller” feature, and the fact that I get email if a Favorite has a price drop. The photography could be a little bit better on black items, but if something arrives that I don’t like, returns are super-easy. My style hasn’t changed a lot since I found ThredUP, but the quality of my clothing has gone way up and I’m spending less.",5
1006,"I’m hooked: Imagine: you go into a store, you fill a buggy with clothes you love... leave what you don’t buy immediately, you get a call later in the week to tell you the price dropped on some of your items! Every time you “love” items or save filters it changes “your store” into a store full of stuff just for you... furthermore you got some stuff to get rid of? ( to make room for more shopping)  Push a button you get a box sent to your house, you fill it up and they sell it for you. It’s a brilliant concept and all of this you do from your couch!
Addictive? YES!",5
1007,"Clothes are great, searching for them is not: I love ordering from Thredup and giving clothes more use time. So good for the Earth and saving money is an added bonus. 
Because you have such huge inventory, better search should be invested in. Things like “similar to this” or “outfit suggestions based on your cart” 
Even when filtering, I filter by size and then what I’m looking for, like pants, and when I click done, the size has defaulted back to all. 

This will not make me stop using this app because I love the concept and feel good about my purchases. But it is a big job that I avoid.",4
1008,"Inconsistent measuring: I like thredUP quite a bit but lately they’ve had an issue with the measurements on their clothes. They’ll say one thing then when I get it it’ll be quite a bit smaller. I know my measurements. I use the tape measure and double check their measurements. The clothes are inches smaller than what they said. I try to return it stating the  measurement was wrong but they still charge me a restocking fee. It would be fine if this was every now and then, but this is almost every order. They even sent me a child’s sized jacket recently saying it was a woman’s jacket. They’re gaining popularity but they’re paying less attention on what they’re selling.",3
1009,"The New Rewards System…..: I love ThredUP, it’s my go-to app for shopping. But as of January 1st, they have installed a rewards system that is so clearly geared towards users spending more money. If you have the SHEIN app, it’s exactly like their rewards program, where the spending for the first two tiers is reasonable, up to $200, then the top tier rewards members need to spend $1000. Then they have around 10 small coupons that only discount 10% off of certain brands, this is upsetting because it feels like the start to a decline in ThredUP’s care for their consumers, that’s what I found was special about thredUP compared to other shopping apps, now they’re just like the rest.",3
1010,"Holes in last two orders!: I just received a pair of lululemon leggings described as “excellent condition, you might mistake them as brand new” with a giant hole on the left knee! The fabric was super worn out as well. How are the excellent condition? I just had to return a pair of under armour shirts that I bought last week for the same reason, there were hikes all up the left leg seams! I understand this is secondhand but you can’t sell people clothes with holes in them and tell them it’s brand new!

 The most frustrating part is I have to PAY to return these clothes that are not wearable because they have holes! I was misled by the description of excellent condition and forced to pay more money to retribution them. Twice in a row!!  If this was just a one time thing I would be totally fine and understand, but twice in a row?!? Not happy :(",1
1011,"Love this app! Positive customer service experience.: I love the assortment of available items through this app. I wish there was a way to search for items in even greater detail, but I’m sure that would be difficult to include. 

I had an issue with a piece I ordered, so I reached out to customer service. I told them my dress was received ripped and they gave me a full refund without having to see the item or returning it. I was told to keep it for myself or donate it. 

One thing I wish the app had is clothes for men. Other than that I’ve had a great experience using this app.",5
1012,"Great deals: I love that I can shop by new with tags. I’ve managed to find a few gems with this site that I’m happy happy with. After several purchases I would recommend reading the product description and fabric details carefully so you’re not surprised by the item you get, and overall you’ll be getting a great deal! I also love that I can choose to bundle my orders to be greener and in case I have any other items I decide to buy that week. I’ve never had to contact customer service so with the experience I’ve had after a year 5 stars.",5
1013,"My new Fav place to shop!!!: I absolutely love buying from Thred Up! I love how you can sort everything from size, price, brand, etc. I have made at least 6 purchases in the last two weeks! I’m addicted! And the way everything arrives is packaged so nicely- even better than a retail store! From the adorable box to the cute tissue! Everything is wrapped so nice, I esp love how they wrap the shoes separate from the clothes. Not to mention everything I’ve received is always in clean and almost like brand new!!!! The shipping is quick. I can’t say enough good things about this place! Love!!!",5
1014,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP. ❤️: I started to buy clothes from this app when I got pregnant. I didn’t want to spend thousands of dollars in clothes that I was only gonna use 4 months. It was amazing the quality and price were so unbelievable good.
I was a little bit scared at first because I would never wear used clothes but like I said I absolutely loved it. And the fact the it’s so easy to use the app it’s a plus. 
Last weeks I spend about $ 5,000 on clothes, I’m absolutely obsessed with this app. 
I have never buy shoes or handbags from them so I can’t speak to that. But the clothes is just amazing.",5
1015,"Great, but..: I love this app, I can spend hours just window shopping and have purchased several things, there are just a couple of things worth noting, 1) shipping is slow, if you need it next weekend then this is not the app for you. 2) selling is easy, but the payout is minimal if you've got the time and want to put in the effort you will make more selling on your own, but if you're just looking to get rid of things you'd otherwise be donating or throwing out it's fine for that. Those two things aside I love ThredUP and will continue to use and recommend to friends.",5
1016,"DO NOT SELL. SUCH A SCAM: I sent in over $1000 worth of clothing in my bag. Basically all brand new, gently worn clothing. My bag included 7 pairs of miss me jeans, 2 pairs of under armour workout pants, 3 under armour sweatshirts and 2 under armour zip jackets. For some reason they only accepted 6 items all of which I’m getting less than $20 for. The other items.... no clue what happened to those. It’s complete BS that this company doesn’t give you the option to obtain the unwanted clothing back before they are “recycled” if that’s even what happened to them. They offered me less than $5 for $100 jeans. The payout percentage is way too low for consignment. I am disgusted with this company. PSA: you’re better off using Poshmark or other selling apps that you actually make a profit from your like new, brand new or gently used clothing. This is a joke.",1
1017,"Best website ever!: I’ve been shopping at ThreadUp almost 10 years. I don’t have anything negative to report. I think the only thing would be that the rewards program changed a few years ago. This caused me to use a change of shopping ‘tactic’ to redeem my points.. nothing negative though. Overall, I love the company. They have evolved from a small startup into a big company with a wonderful & intelligent business model. I am hooked and will be a life long customer. Beyond 5 star rating. Highly recommended!",5
1018,"First place I shop: I shop at ThredUP before even walking in a store. I used to buy a lot of clothes at Target because that's what I could afford. Then they'd fall apart or fade. Now, I spend the same amount of money to buy higher quality clothes- even designer labels- for the same as I'd spend at Target. 

The selling portion of ThredUP is terrible, which makes me nervous that the quality and selection won't last. There needs to be free shipping and higher payout (even if it's only in store credit). I sent in a bag filled with brand new clothes (tags on) and received nothing because my payout didn't even cover the cost of shipping them the bag.",4
1019,"Love it, have a few suggestions: I love this app, but have a few suggestions on how to improve it:
- put all bags (especially backpacks!) on a mannequin, for scale, because I’m dumb and can’t always picture measurements 
- if a product has text on it, tell me what the text reads in the description, because it is not always legible in the photos
- include inseam measurements for jumpsuits
- I know Athleta sports bras use band (S/M/L, etc) and cup (A-C/D-DD) sizes, so it would be great to include both sizing metrics on those products
- I like that the description will include if an item is dry clean only, but I would like it if every item’s washing instructions were included
- I would like it if the filters allowed me to filter out designer items so I don’t see them
Love this app, use it all the time, which is how I was able to come up with these suggestions lol. I really like how this app makes thrifting accessible to new crowds!",5
1020,"Wonderful for mamas!: I’m obsessed! Been shopping at ThreadUp since before the app was easy (back when used my laptop for website lol). It’s saved my family so much! The kids clothing, all the clothing (“new with tags” gems) for me, and I sell here a lot! Makes my shopping easy! I toggle between here and the Rack’s app for the best deals &&& when I love something in my closet that is not in stores anymore, I save a search in ThreadUp app to keep checking if shows up :))) I tell so many moms about this site! Green fashion that’s easy on your green$!",5
1021,"Luv my planet: I love saving money, of course, but more importantly I love that I am saving the planet one beautiful outfit at a time. I try to buy everything used or upcycle everything that I can. I’m a child of the sixties and live for art that I create to celebrate our beautiful planet. God gifted us with everything we need. We need to share it with everyone and thing here. Besides, it is fun to turn something old into something new and lovely. Thanks for offering a cheap, clean, easy way to dumpster dive. Crissie the ditzy pixie is my alter ego. We have never been disappointed.",5
1022,"Not worth it anymore: I used to love this app. As a reseller, I clean out my inventory and closet quarterly and would send out bags full of clothing for thread up to sell for me. It used to be worth it when they sent the bags or even allowed you to send your own box. Recently they have changed and by the time you’re done paying for the processing time and to have items sent back to you, you’re left with no profit!!! You only get about fifty cents for an item they sell for ten bucks! How are people expected to make a profit?! Now If they sell your kit and it’s not enough to cover the processing time, you have to cough up money! What is even the point anymore?! I hate when businesses start up one way and change their practices. I won’t be using anymore.",1
1023,"The only place I shop now!: The prices are great, fashion doesn’t change all that much to merit the difference at full retail. Pieces are beautifully and carefully wrapped. If it doesn’t fit, just return it for 3.99 or for free with your points. I got new $750 boots for $90 and I love them! It’s the first app I open every day so I can keep an eye on my favourites. The hearts are kept separate so I don’t have to start all over again and there is no limit to how many items I can keep track of. If you love a treasure hunt, you will love thread up!",5
1024,"Love the premise but...: The app as well as how the clothing is categorized is frustrating. First clothing is often miscategorized. A dress that is clearly more business like is categorized as casual dress. 

I suppose that can be viewed as a matter of opinion but what is most frustrating is that the filters on the app don't work correctly. For instance when searching for a work dress, the app is retuning dresses labelled as cocktail dresses in the results. Or when I search for boots and the results return all kinds of shoes that are not boots. 

The lack of ability to correctly filter out things I don't want from a group of say 18,000 items makes finding what I do want very challenging. This looks like a defect that should have been found during UAT, rather than the users.",2
1025,"Read ALL the fine print: Make sure you read all the fine print! I don’t necessarily think this is a bad app, I just rated it low because I know many will not read the fine print. It takes weeks before they even receive your bag. I do not find the website to be knowledge friendly. I have continued to reach out to customer service to figure out why, 4 weeks later, they still have not received my bag. Through the exploration to figure out how to contact customer service, I have found many interesting facts out, about this device, buried deep within their website. I wish a lot of this info would have been presented upfront. Regardless, I still have no idea when they will be receiving my bag, that was sent with postage paid to ship back ( which was done a month ago)",1
1026,"Horrible customer service: Loved buying from them until I had an issue and tried contacting customer service. For one, there’s no number to call and just talk to someone so that’s really frustrating. And the supposedly “live chat” is not helpful at all. It’s not a live chat, it’s a rep will get to it when they’re not on lunch break. (Yes the chick actually responded an hour later and said sorry I was on lunch) They said they would fix my shipping issue and it’s been 4 going on 5 days now and nothing has happened. The order should already be here by now and they’ve completely ignored it and it’s still processing. None of my previous orders took this long to simply process and get here. HORRIBLE customer service. You just lost a customer.",2
1027,"Bad for sellers, decent for buyers: My biggest critique is that the photos are terrible. Lots of wrinkled, lazily arranged, poorly edited photos do nothing for shoppers. I take better photos at home when I sell on other apps compared to what they call “professional photography”. I read through their selling policies and I’d never sell here, there’s a giant list of hundreds of brands they won’t give you a cut for selling. As for being a shopper, the prices are decent and I like that everything you buy is in one order, unlike most thrift apps where everything is sold by individual sellers so you have to pay tax and shipping on each item.",3
1028,"Amazing: I did a year challenge a few years back to not buy anything new. I had some awareness of online consignment or thrift stores. I tried out a few and they were ok. When I finally found thred-up I was tired of low quality or overpriced clothes. 
Thank goodness that Thred-up has people that look for good clothes, care about their website, and have great customer service. 
I only buy my clothes from them. If something isn’t right I can connect with them and the options are amazing!",5
1029,"Great way to shop and save the earth!: I LOVE thrift shopping but sometimes you walk out with nothing because the condition of items is bad or the selection is small or the lack of organization means digging for your size. While I still have some misses on sizing (happens when you don’t know the brand) I’ve loved almost everything I’ve purchased! I just wish return windows were open for longer as if you’re too slow on getting it ready to return, you’re out of luck.",5
1030,"Overall satisfied: Not only is buying used a more sustainable way to shop but you can certainly find some gems on here for an affordable price! Overall I’ve been pretty pleased with my experiences with shopping on the app, shipping, clean out kits, & customer service. My only note is occasionally I’ll receive an item that does not match the fabric/material details posted on the listing which unfortunately for me is quite important when I am purchasing clothing used or new - but that may not even be a concern for other shoppers. Regardless, I definitely recommend ThredUP.",4
1031,"So COOL: i love this company. the premise, the items, the cool styles...it's the best. there are so many one of a kind items on there that match unique styles like mine. for people like me who only like to buy things they really like/embody, this store has various interesting and unique finds that will make you feel right at home. JUST A TIP: some older brands have different ideas of today's sizes (they run big or small), so the best thing to do is look at the measurements listed below! you should be satisfied then. literally in love with thredup and recommend it to literally everyone i know haha. 

on with love ❤️✨",5
1032,"Girls we run this mother: ... but still get paid less, are expected to look amazing, and yet also expected to take those underhanded, rude comments whenever we don’t. Till we work somewhere we can clap back at will, or take down the patriarchy, there’s ThredUp for all those, I don’t want to spend a ton of money work/social expectations.
Reality, there’ll still be ThredUp long after my stale office days- all the mini skirts my heart desires. 
App caveat, so many of the same or similar notifications. Small swipe to pay for what you get in return, for what you get in return, it’s a steal.",5
1033,"Disappointing: This app needs more work and updates on photo listings. Great quality pictures, BUT need to add more detailed photos of the item. Close ups, interior of the bags, labels and etc.... 1-2 photos is not good enough, especially when you’re buying designer items. Price isn’t all that great anyway for high end items on this app. I’ll stick with my other apps that’s better. Also some items are ALL SALES ARE FINAL? Ummmm.. that’s ridiculous when you only have 2 photos showing? This is why, this app isn’t as good as other successful buy & sell apps out there! I downloaded this app long time ago and deleted. I downloaded again just to give it another chance, but still disappointing app. Deleting FOREVER! Ship to them to sell is so annoying..... this app not gonna work for me.",1
1034,"Love for the most part: I recently purchased a sundress through thredUP and loved it but noticed it had a small hole in the dress near the thigh. I went back to the original posting to see that no notifications of the imperfection had been made on the posting. But when you look closely at the original picture it has a small “mark” that is the hole in the dress. 

I was under the impression that thredUP did not allow imperfections at all in the clothing they purchased. I am really disappointed to see and hear from personal references that their clothes were not purchased from this company due to lack of style or something similar to this hole but this dress slipped through somehow.",3
1035,"Items are not always as advertised: I have made six orders on thredUP and I have found that the pictures and description of the quality of the items is not always accurate. I only buy “new with tags” or “like-new” items. One pair of like-new jeans I ordered had snags in them that were not visible in the picture. A shirt I ordered was all pilly when called like-new. A sweatshirt I ordered was also like-new but had brown stains on the sleeve cuffs and down the front. I think the employees need to be more careful when examining pieces and listing what condition they are in. I’m very frustrated with the company because of this. I love the concept and sustainability of buying second-hand so conveniently through an app, but I want to know exactly what I’m paying for.",2
1036,"Change in Quality of Products: I am a long time user of ThredUP. For years I have avoided clothing stores as this was my go to clothing shopping site.  If I had completed this rating a year ago it would have been a five.  However in the last six months or so, I have notice a sharp decline in the product quality.

I continuously have to send items back because they are heavy soiled and piled even though the description was like new.  I ordered a $50+ pair of Lulu Lemon workout pants described as just like new and there was a hole in the rear of the pants.  I just returned a “like new” “JCrew” Top that was actually Express brand with heavy piling and dark armpit stains.

I recently sent a bag of clothes in to sell on the site.  Three or four pieces with decent size price tags suddenly became “unavailable” with no funds transferred and no explanation as to what happened. 

I am so disappointed in the horrible turn ThredUP has taken lately.  I will not be returning.",5
1037,"Great app!: I love ThredUP! I’m addicted and check it at least twice a day. I’ve made multiple purchases through them, they accept Apple Pay! I’ve even ordered clean out kits from them. My only issue is how long the turn around time is from when they send you the clean out kit to them going through what you sent. I’m sitting at a month and a half and they still haven’t gone through my kit :(

The app gets 5 stars all day long! All items you buy ship quick and you get tracking numbers for them all. Costumer service is quick, but the clean out kit processing time I’ll give 3 stars, it just takes forever!",4
1038,Great for shoppers. Bad for sellers: I love thredUP. I love everything you’re doing however I do think to maintain customer loyalty. You need to provide a credit of $10-$30 for clean out bags sent in. I recently sent you two cleanup bags you have sold $60 worth and given me nothing in return I would appreciate at least a credit to my account to continue in the thredUP community. I have also recommended thredUP to many friends and family who have the same complaint. Thank you for sharing this experience.,5
1039,"DO NOT SELL.: I am very displeased with my experience with this company. Buying from them is fine. Selling to them, however, is nauseating.

I sent a giant bag full of designer clothes (Ann Taylor, Levi, banana republic, express) some of which were either new with tags or made of high quality materials like silk or merino wool. I made 50 cents. FIFTY CENTS. Some of the literally brand new items they didn't take. It makes me want to throw up. I could have thrown that stuff away and felt better about it but instead I have supported this ruthless company that profits 95% by preying on fashion-savvy people tight on money. I'm honestly suspicious that the stuff they don't accept they keep because how could they possibly donate brand new jeans from places like express. Its poor business practice and doesn't make sense. I'm disgusted. 

Wish I could have donated to goodwill because then the prices would have at least been reasonable. It is wrong to give someone 2$ for a pair of 90$ jeans and then sell them for 20$ and have the audacity to mark them as ""rare"" or ""quality"" when the price you paid me did not reflect that. 

Very displeased. Will never consort with again. Protect yourself from this company.",1
1040,"My go-to for clothes: On each item, they have measurements, so you don’t have to guess whether something is going to fit like it’s supposed to. There are a lot of ways to search, browse categories, and filter results so you can really find if you’re looking for something specific. You can save searches and get emails when something your looking for becomes available. I got an Alexander McQueen dress in perfect condition for $160 because I saw it in my email notifications.  I’m a big fan.",5
1041,"Love ThredUP!: I can always find great things on ThredUP for great prices, but there are some things I would fix about the app. I wish you could make different lists within your likes. It would be much easier to find certain things in your favorites list. I also find that the measurements given are not the most accurate sometimes. I’ve gotten items that have been way off from the listed measurements and had to return them. If you guys could improve that, that would be great.",5
1042,"Website vs App Experience: I have used Thred Up for years to thrift online and love it! From a customer standpoint, I enjoy the bargains and variety of styles and just accept that not every piece may work for me in person. My only complaint is the variance between app and web experience. The web gives you many more opportunities to discover fashions through suggested categories (“shop similar”, “recently sold”, etc) under the listing while the app relies more on your search input and seems to steer you more toward purchasing from the same seller instead.",4
1043,"Very confusing business model: I have sent in 2 bags of clothing. I they have received, the other seems to have disappeared into the ether. You cannot find out easily when your bag arrives nor can you adjust the prices prior to them selling, it seems you have very little control over much of anything on this app. I have supposedly sold several items but I cannot find on the app how much I’ve made or earned, I can only see that they have taken the bulk of the profits. I don’t think I will be using them ever again as their practices seem pretty shady. I’d be very careful if you want to sell with them as they will be making most of the money off your clothes,  not you!",2
1044,"Decent: I’ve had a lot of success with what I’ve purchased. Lots of shoes, tops, and jackets. That said, despite their “high standards” for what they take, I’ve received some pretty poor items, including glaringly stained shoes and a pair of pants very worn and a clear period stain. My biggest issue with the app is the restocking fees. And while I understand why they may need them, it is prohibitive because I won’t purchase pants since they vary so much for me. The same goes for purses. I do not understand why purses are ‘final sale’ items. I’ve bought a few purses and have had varying success. Pictures of the inside of the purse would be awesome. I give this app a solid “B”.",3
1045,Changes: I have a clean out kit that was received in August and it still haven’t processed yet. The shipping price increased to $8.99 since everything thing else has increased. The prices for some of the clothing has increased as well and they’re barely a decent or known brand. I’ve seen some items where you can clearly see the price tag from another store but it’s priced higher on here. I usually shop for new with tags or like new items. A jumpsuit that I purchased was from the girl’s/preteen section. I’m starting to feel like it’s more worth it to stick to shopping at thrift stores or stick to the clearance section at retail stores.,3
1046,"Drained my battery when not in use!: I downloaded this app for easy shopping and almost had to get a new phone! Even when not in use, whatever they use to track you across platforms caused my battery to drain like no other. I would have to have my phone on charge every few hours and it was always hot to the touch. In checking my battery usage, this app accounted for 76% of my battery life (yes, also on days I never accessed the app and it was not open in the background). Seeing as other apps were actually being used and only accounted for 12-15% battery usage this was ridiculous. Got rid of the app and my phone keeps full charge all day, no overheating or other issues. BEWARE! I thought my phone was on the fritz.",1
1047,"Love it and hate it for most coveted items: Love that ThredUp exists in general for those us who like to shop from the comfort of our own home.  HOWEVER, I really wish there was a better alert system in place for items that are in someone’s cart and you’re wanting to buy for yourself, and why is it that these items are now available for 12 hours instead of the usual 4? 
The app glitches out on me constantly when it comes to those alerts or when it comes to checking up on the items in your cart.  Other than that it’s great!",4
1048,"Obsessed: Have been using for 2 years ish... so much easier than real
Real or posh mark .. gets items out of my closet postage free and either RE homed or donated ... win win
I found new anthro sandals last year that wow I love .. I also like that any age woman can use the service so even a house bound person can fill a bag and leave for postman at home... I keep a bag going so as I notice I am not wearing something.. I stick it in bag.. shoes , jewelry , handbags , scarves , jackets , formal wear.. so easy. Brilliant idea and works for all ages, great way to pick up special
Occasion stuff you wear once or higher end stuff /vintage items that can be lightly used and fantastic .",4
1049,"Love Thred Up: I absolutely love thred up!  And I would hands down give it a 5 star.  However, a couple things that have changed since I joined the community that leaves me disappointed; 1) they are no longer measuring clothes and so I find I am returning more than I have in the past; and 2) they have not been sending out as many coupons as they use to, now it is only for first time users and an occasional $10 off once a quarter.  Would be better incentive if there was discounts to those who have hit certain levels of spending/donating etc.",5
1050,"Horrible Customer Service: I sent in a bag full of clothes with a return assurance only to find out they had donated the clothes that didn’t make the cut. I put a return assurance on my items because I would have worn them myself if I received them back. The customer service person I spoke with was so cavalier about the mistake and even blamed me for the issue. It seems the company no longer has a customer service number, which is insanely annoying. And the re-stocking fee? Forget it. I’d rather bring my two young children with me to the mall (a huge challenge) and find one magical piece than order and order items that aren’t right and deal with the hassles of waiting for clothes, which are often mos-described, and returning them. Especially when their customer service is so brutal.",1
1051,"Never Sell Through This App: I deeply regret selling through this app. I’ve never used it before and sent them a huge back of clothing, shoes and purses valuing far over $1000. Obviously the price decreases and i wasn’t expecting any large amount of money but i received...$18. $17 after the fee to transfer to my bank account. The process of them receiving and posting the products then waiting to give you money to see what sells took months. I wanted them to just return everything after i saw most items would only give me between .50-$2 while they listen it around $15-$30. However you have to pay the shipping few to get all of your items returned. This app is a SCAM and i will never be selling or buying from them again. In fact Im deleting the app write after i post this.",1
1052,"Not impressed: Unfortunately I am extremely disappointed in this entire process! I was very excited in the beginning to make money selling my clothes through this site and I told my friends and family to do the same! 
But ultimately, not only did I give away my clothes for free, I had to pay to get my own remaining clothes back that didn’t sell! How is this remotely fair when your selling my new clothes for good money $$ and giving me pennies on the dollar for them?? 
Save your time, clothes and your efforts! I could have sold them on my own and made money or donated them to a good cause or deserving people that would have made me feel A LOT better!! 
I am very disappointed and will not participate in this again. You’ve lost me as an advocate and a customer. thredUP you should make this right.",1
1053,"Poor customer service and inaccurate descriptions: They take almost forever to respond to your concerns. I have been spending on Thredup since the past 3 months and my orders have always been a minimum of 10 items. But I feel like they don’t value their customers. The stuff that I have been getting recently is defective in some way or the other. I purchased a Nicholas top recently for $32 and I agree that it has the tags but it has stains and a tear. I usually end up just fixing it if I like the item. 2 items in one of my previous orders were listed as NWT but they weren’t. They have also started marking up the prices, even for items with defects. It’s really disappointing and I may stop buying from them altogether.",2
1054,"Could use improvement: This app is adequate, not excessively horrible but not knock your socks off amazing either. I have ordered a few items from ThredUP, some fit appropriately, some don’t. The descriptions aren’t amazing, I bought something that was advertised as black and when it came in was clearly blue. If you try to sell anything, don’t plan on it being a speedy process. It takes twice as long to receive your cleanout bag than it does to get any ordered item, I would have to assume this is because it takes quite a bit of time to print and attach the shipping label. Now if you want to pay extra you can speed this process up a bit, so there’s that.",3
1055,"Think Secondhand First: I love ThredUP and the constantly changing selection! They list an accurate description and any flaws, or if the item is in perfect condition clearly. If you see something you like, it’s best to grab it before someone else does. It’s not likely you’ll find that item again for that price anywhere else. I scroll through daily to see new items and I’m never disappointed. They package and ship your items with care. I am so pleased with my purchases. Have not sent items in for them to sell, yet. Working on that next!",5
1056,"Sustainable clothing shopping makes you feel good!: I love ThredUP!! Prices are great there’s always something new and I check in a couple times a week. Im between sizes and I don’t want to purchase expensive clothing if I’m only going to wear them for a month. So thredUP really helps me in purchasing quality clothing for great prices. Ive bought sweaters, dresses, shoes, purses and jewelry. I’ve been happy with all my purchases. When you put something in your cart you have 24 hours to purchase or it goes out of your cart. Returns are easy and if you purchase more than $79 shipping is free.",5
1057,"So easy and works well!: I love that this app is so easy to use. Once you make an account it will only show you YOUR custom sizes, which I love! Payment is easy, shipping is quick and my favorite part is great clothes at an awesome price! I’ve always been into consignment shops but my life is too busy now to have the time to really look like I need to. This bridges that gap. 
Also, I have to say that their customer service is fantastic. They are proactive, attentive and effective. I have been quite impressed and now can’t stop telling everyone I know that they need to give ThredUP a try!",5
1058,"Great stuff but customer service is lacking: I’ve ordered a bunch of stuff and really loved everything I received.  However I have had a problem with packages being delivered completely mangled.  While I don’t blame ThredUp for what is obviously a shipping issue, I at least expected a reply when I tried to tell them about it.  There is a chat with a rep feature but it just said someone would get back to me and no one did.  Then I tried emailing them and still got no reply at all.  I love their stuff but if something goes wrong expect to be on your own.",5
1059,"Some great, some good, some bad: As a shopper, I have gotten some pretty great things at good prices. I love the concept of reducing waste by buying secondhand. I think the prices are good for items in good condition, but a little high for items not in good condition. Everything comes quickly and is packaged nicely. I have only had to do two returns, both of which went smoothly, although a little bit slowly.

I have recently sent one bag in for sale. I got an email that it was received, but it would be 31 days before it would be processed, which seems ridiculously long.

Overall, I am happy and will continue to shop thredup.",4
1060,Customer service is impossible to reach: I love to shop thredup and would have given them a 5 star review but they just cancelled my order for no reason and it is impossible to get them on a chat. They make you jump through hoops to get to an actual person.  I have been trying for almost an hour to reach someone on a chat so they can explain why my order was cancelled and I can request that they replace the order. I buy a lot from them and this is bad customer service.,5
1061,"Not worth selling on: It’s not worth it at all. Highly don’t recommend. I sent in 30 items and they originally said the potential payout was close to $200. Started the process in April and here we are almost August and my total earned is currently $21 however they said there’s $23 of extra service fees so my net earned is negative. So now I’m waiting to see if I’ll be charged for trying to sell my items with them. I chose the fast processing time which obviously isn’t very fast. And chose the option for them to keep my items if they didn’t sell, which I noticed they’re on their site now again for sell. So they’re really no potential to make any kind of real money. You’re better off on marketplace, Plato’s Closet or just donating.",1
1062,"Recent update messed up search function: I like ThredUp, but the recent app changes have rendered it unusable. You can’t search anymore.  All of my Saved searches have been distorted to show the wrong products.  Even if I start a new search, it doesn’t show the correct products, even if I put the search term in quotations it still shows the wrong products.  For example, I had a saved search for Bordello shoes, and every time I went online I could see new listings, now I click on it and none of the products are Bordello at all.  For other searches they aren’t even in the right product category.",3
1063,"Love it: ThredUP has been helping me get dressed for several years now and I am so happy I found it. I feel like I can wear nice things, look good and not spend a fortune. The cool thing too is that I can try designer brands that would have been completely out of the budget. My only critique is that I wish it was a little easier to have more specific searches by creating more tags, but I still love it and it just means spending a little longer searching. Also- super fun when I get my polka dot box in the mail!",5
1064,"Like new items ?: I like thread up, but I’ve had issues with items being advertised as “like new” and when they arrive, they have damage, so they aren’t “like new”. The worst part is that even putting this as the return reason they still have it in them to charge you a restocking fee. It’s also a bummer that in order to get the refund to your original payment, they make you pay for the shipping. So that’s another $8.99 fee I have to pay because the item was advertised incorrectly. All in all I paid them $10 for an item I’m not keeping due to an incorrect description on their part. Not cool.",3
1065,"OBSESSED!!: I’m obsessed with ThredUP! I love second hand shopping and doing it from my phone is even better!! I hate spending full price on designer items, plus it feels good to shop secondhand, which is a more sustainable option than buying brand new. The app is very user friendly. I love all the additional discounts they offer! I love that you can pay with Affirm. The only thing I wish ThredUP did was write better product descriptions and take a few more detailed photos. Other than that I’m hooked! I’ve had the app for 3 weeks and have already placed 3 orders.",5
1066,"Not Enough Information: There is not enough dimension information in order for me to make a purchase. 

For example, clothes made in Europe have a different sizing number than the ones from the US. A rounded up US size is listed, which doesn't help and is an accurate.

Dress dimensions only mention the chest, not the hips, which would be equally, or even more, important.

And finally, some clothes listed actually don't belong exactly to that brand. And there is no photo of the tag, which would help show what brand it actually is.

There is ABSOLUTELY no way to contact someone to clarify these questions. I've gone in circles on his app trying to contact customer service. A complete waste of time. Once I did figure it out a while back through email all they told me was that they cannot measure the item. 

I don't understand how anybody buys anything here. I've purchased things on other platforms where I can contact the seller directly, because, as everyone does, I have questions.",3
1067,"Please be more descriptive in item names...: ...Or at least give the seller the ability to include their own product description; sometimes using this app to find clothes can be just as frustrating as sorting through messy shelves at a physical thrift store. The listing titles should be more descriptive. I don’t want to scroll through a bunch of unrelated items because the items use general umbrella terms. If I’m searching for an oversized shirt, show me that - not every shirt on the app! Depop makes a much better use of the user’s search time by allowing users to type in and find exactly what they’re looking for.",4
1068,"Lost all my stuff: I sent over a bundle in late January full of Gucci, Prada, Ferragamo, Armani, Tory Burch, and many others with Lululemon and Nike being the cheapest items to be sold/consigned. 

I usually use real real which has exceptional customer service and someone mentioned this company so I gave it a go. All of February, I tried to get some of my items back as I was going to keep them instead (all items were in great condition) and their customer service kept giving me the run around. After waiting on delays after delays for the app to be updated, I was left blind-sighted on where my items were or how much they would offer for it. And when I can actually get stuff returned to me. 

Come March (over a month of waiting)- they sent a short email saying they lost my items and put $35 in my account. Not a single dose of regret for their mistake. No recourse for their actions or accountability for losing all my items. Should I take legal action?! I am contemplating as they literally stole from me. 

This place is THE WORST second hand shop I’ve dealt with. I highly suggest you avoid them. Just donate if anything and sell your expensive items elsewhere.",1
1069,Quality and easy returns: Thredup takes thrift shopping to the next level. There is great selection and an easy way to sell your items too. They make that very easy just return the bag filled at any FedEx store and when you purchase items it’s nice how you can use your payout funds right there. At first I didn’t know how to return but after reviewing the app I realized how easy that was too. My first order I only returned 1 item out of 7 things. I really enjoy the great deals and getting items with tags on for 40-60% off is amazing. Now I can get my favorite jeans without feeling guilty about the purchase.,4
1070,"Absolutely Blown Away!!!!: I started a new job and needed all new work clothes, so I used this app for the first time and couldn't believe the INCREDIBLE experience. I picked out all designer brands, some new with tags, for a fraction of the retail price and was blown away when my 3 boxes came much earlier than expected, all wrapped in adorable tissue paper, and every single item looked brand new (not just the ""new with tags"" ones). I already started recommending this app to all my friends and they have all bought many items and feel just as thrilled with this discovery as I am 😊",5
1071,"Clothing recycling at it’s finest: I have used ThredUP several times since getting the app. The prices are reasonable, there is always a sale going on, and the best part is that I feel good knowing I am buying clothing that still has life in it. I am only purchasing thrifted/used items (trying to be more responsible when it comes to our earth) and it is awesome to still get the online shopping experience here. So many items, and new items added constantly. I plan on continuing to use ThredUP to dress happy!",5
1072,"Love the website, app always logs me out: I love ThredUp! When I’m looking for something specific I always check ThredUp before my local thrift stores. 

That said, the app is frustrating! It always logs me out as soon as I’ve stopped using it actively; if I quit the app or just leave it long enough that it has to reload on the next return, it logs me out and I have to re-enter my login info to continue shopping. While this isn’t a deal breaker to using ThredUp, the continual logging out is VERY annoying and does drive me to just use the web browser instead. Please fix this annoying bug so your app is actually useful!",3
1073,"Ok but risky.: I've used other apps and online resale before. This one is frustrating because they give a size but few actual measurements.  ThredUP's measurements are correct about 50% of the time. I sew. I know how to measure clothes.
There is no way to contact the company through the app and returns are almost impossible. Good luck finding an easy way to do that. 
I have received 3 items that were rated good as new and they weren't. A lining that was almost completely torn out of the jacket. A pair of pants with a hole in the front. Not just a snag. A hole. And a skirt with multiple obvious snags. 
They really need to find a better way to photograph black clothes. I wear black and pass up most of the clothing because it's impossible to see any detail at all. 
Shoes and boots should have a picture of the soles and inside.  
Takes a loooong time to get your order. I'm sure its to encourage adding to the order. Stops me from shopping with them if I'm looking for something I need sooner than a month out.",3
1074,"Great seller option but read the fine print: Great app but support needs to be beefed up significantly so I am not waiting over 30 min in a chat queue. That is if you can even catch them when chat is available, and the times are not posted.
Also be careful to read the fine print. I paid to have my unlisted items returned to me, and they kept a handful of items as ZERO PAYOUT. I’ve also had a pair of Givenchy sunglasses from Nordstrom not listed because they couldn’t authenticate them. 🙄
Check your listings carefully for the status. There is a 80% chance that your new with tags items are not listed as such.",3
1075,"Love!: I love online thrifting through ThredUp! I have found so many great things on here and it’s my fav place to shop for clothes! I have bought gym clothes, a dress for a school dance, running shoes, college gear, and much more! The only problem I have is sometimes the measurements are off. When it comes to pants, I bought a pair that was my size according to the measurements (26x30) but they were way shorter than the measurement. Other than that I 100% recommend shopping from here! A very sustainable and affordable way to shop!",5
1076,"Glitchy and unreliable: The app is pretty glitchy and the company policies are unreliable. Items marked returnable on product pages are marked as FINAL SALE once discount codes are applied in the cart. Restock fees are also not consistent and although they were once $1.99 across the board, now they can be as high as $3.99, but there is no warning of that before you order. The company needs to fix the app and change their policies so that items are only marked final sale in the cart if that is shown on the product page, and there needs to be one consistent pre-advertised restock fee, so shoppers know what to expect. They’ve been alerted to these issues for months and have not fixed them.",2
1077,"Optimal Shopping Experience: This App is super easy to use and completely customizable. I haven’t experienced a single bug with it and the features it has like showing which of you favorite items are in someone’s cart, setting automatic purchase on items if they become available, and picture displays of items along with their status for purchases already made are just a handful of the many things that make this App great. Only drawback is it’s too easy to use and I might have a shopping problem now. 😳",5
1078,"Poor customer service: I so want to LOVE Thredup but contacting someone regarding a problem is near impossible. There is no way to easily find how to email. Chat is very slow too. Customer service needs major improvement 👎🏼Also, I am noticing that the condition of items I order does NOT match the description. Quality control and review of clothing has suffered tremendously lately. About 1/3 of the items I order are not listed correctly whether it be sizing, measurements or quality of the merchandise. I suffer, you suffer, we all suffer when that occurs. Straighten up Thredup. Also, when I use MY Points, why am I forced to use a Bundle option to get Free shipping even though I am redeeming points?",2
1079,"Notifications don’t work - sort of fixed: This app never notifies me when things show up in my saved searches, I keep missing out on stuff I really want to buy because of this. It’s a cool place to buy stuff but between technical issues and jacking up prices randomly on like cheaper clothing and sometimes receiving things that are marked as ‘like new’ and they’re stained or damaged, it’s hard to give a good rating.

Edit: right after I left this review it started working, so I guess it gets another star for that, but Ive frequently run into tech issues the few years I’ve been using it.",4
1080,"Great service and finds!: I've had multiple orders with Thredup and they've arrived just as described in fun, polka dot paper.  Any questions I've had regarding shipping or discounts, I simply message or chat with customer service, allowing them time to get back to me, and they've gone above and beyond to make my experience good.  I'm not sure what situations others have had but in my use of this awesome search-and-discover site, I have only the best to recommend them. I've purchased, not listed, any personal clothing for sale.",5
1081,"Threw up is great: Love the site. Finding good quality basic cloths. (Red, black and white) and some fun things I would never have even tried on in the past but I’m learning what designers work for me and I’m enjoying having good Ccoths. This is better then retail but much more then thrift. For that reason I gave it a four star. Have had no problems with shipping or returns. But would love a few more coupons or discount offers for cloths in my cart. Not just “10% off today on jeans”. Maybe I’m not looking for jeans or I’m a tough fit. Let me pick where I apply my discount.",5
1082,"A lot of stuff on here is way more expensive than they should be.: Some of the prices on here are wildly inaccurate or just ridiculous. I had been eyeing a jumpsuit on ThredUp for $100 with estimated retail value of $150, but then I found it being sold for $50 on the brand’s actual website. Also, I’m sorry but I refuse to buy $70 used Lululemon leggings with stains just because they’re Lululemon.  I have found some really good deals on here, but you have to know what you’re looking for and know how much things are worth new. Usually you can just google the item and the brand and find out how much it actually costs.",4
1083,"Suggestions: You guys need to get models to actually show off the clothes. 
OR at least be way more descriptive when showing the clothing. Take more pictures. It’s hard to decide if I like something based on TWO pictures!! I got a dress it’s beautiful I love it but. The description was black and White it has GREEN undertones. 
GREEN you could’ve told me it would be green. Also it was shiney like it hard sparkles you could’ve said that before I got it. Also you should add the pictures of the tags! And the washing tags so we know upfront what we are getting. My dress I can’t wash it because it’s wool. You guys never added that to the description :/ so that would be really helpful thank you",3
1084,Great for shopping but don’t recommend selling: My shopping experiences have been very good but I just recently sent in a closet clean out kit and I’m pretty disappointed in process. It takes forever for them to receive and review your items and I’m really questioning the quality that they accepted from my bag. I’m very surprised by the items they kept and the ones they will be disposing of and how little my pay out is. Not an overall horrible experience but I will not be sending my clothes there again. I’d rather just donate my items than receive the $7.81 for my total clean out of 20 items.,4
1085,"the concept is nice...: I downloaded this app with the idea that I would make a good amount of money for the summer. The free clean out tote thing they give you takes a long time to ship, and it takes even longer for them to price your clothing. In total, I have made $15 from 7 pieces of clothing. That’s not even the part I’m upset about. They priced my clothing to about $30-$50 dollars and marked the price down to $20 to make people think they got a deal. I didn’t even pay anywhere near $15 for the clothing. Thus, if people were to buy it they wouldn’t be getting a single deal. In conclusion, I will not be supporting this company any longer since they have brung my hopes up just to give me $15. I can’t even go out to dinner with that.",2
1086,"I’d Give it Zero or negative stars if I could!: Customer service is THE worst. Fedex apparently had damaged the envelope causing the contents to spill out. So I contacted fed ex who directed me to contact the shipping company’s customer service to file a claim since it was a “smart post delivery”.  The literal ONLY way to contact them is via text message in the app or in the website. If you choose any of the contact customer service options it directs you to a FAQ that states you still need to contact customer service, and they actually have the audacity to ask if my question was answered!!! Then these ignorant morons have the nerve to say that they will contact you in a “couple of hours”... do they know what a “couple” is? It means two, two hours. 4 hours later they’ve contacted me in a “couple of hours”. NEVER!! EVER!!! AGAIN!!!",1
1087,"Expensive and Poor App: Sadly, I really enjoyed thredUP with my first order, but as I continue to shop, I notice a lot of discrepancies within the company. First, many of the items are overpriced. After all, thredUP sells used clothes, yet many of there items cannot compete with large clothing chains because they are similarly priced. What’s stopping me from getting a new shirt from PacSun than a used shirt that’s the same price? Secondly, there shipping and refunds also do not compete to larger clothing chains. If I want an eight dollar shirt, I do not want to pay more than have of my order on shipping. Finally, they do not offer free refunds, which gives me another reason to order from a larger company. It’s a shame, because a lot of there clothing is very cute.",2
1088,"A great way to shop!: I love Thread Up. I heard about it on the news a few years ago and was instantly hooked. I’ve always loved thrift shopping and this is the ultimate way to do it. Many people complain about not getting much money for the items they sell but I usually take my unwanted items to Goodwill anyway so that doesn’t bother me. The only thing missing is a way to filter your favorited items by category. Additionally, men’s clothing would be a huge hit so hopefully they add that eventually.",5
1089,"Not recommended for sellers: Unless you set your expectations very low I recommend just donating.   If you want some return on your investment in nice, well cared for clothes, sell on your own using another company like Poshmark.  I sent 3 fully packed bags of mostly like-new, name brand items back in June and they've only processed about 20 items.   Where did the rest go?   Don't know.  I get inundated with junk email from them and I got an email from a marketing person asking for feedback.  I don't feel like they deserve a reply.  It's late August now.  I feel like someone may have stolen my clothes that were worth hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars.   My mistake!   Also the app has bugs.   I recently moved and updated my address in the app, then ordered another bag.  It went to my old address.",1
1090,"Nickel and dime: They buckle and done you. They charge you to send clothes in, they charge you to return clothes. It used to be a nice company to work with. You can send in thousands of dollars of clothes and get $1. They put a time limit on the sell and then charge you to process it. Altogether not worth dealing with them anymore. Donate locally and get a receipt for your taxes- you will come out better( unless you are selling designer clothes then idk). Shop locally too because then you can see the items and don't pay to return them. The pictures are bad and descriptions aren't as accurate as they used to be. You'll have to return half the items you order and loose money for their reprocessing fee. Disappointed in their ""evolution"".",1
1091,"Rewards system: I really like this app and how it makes thrifting a little easier, also in a way more accessible too. And I love all the pieces that I’ve bought so far. Something that confuses me though is, why do the rewards points expire? Thrifting is meant to encourage sustainable fashion that reduces one’s eco-footprint. Sooo.. why are those who don’t buy often, I don’t wanna say punished, but I don’t know what other word to use. Like, y’know when you don’t buy a lot within a 1 year timeframe, you don’t make enough points and the rewards system becomes kinda useless.",4
1092,"Sorry to go…☹️: I have been buying and selling on ThredUP for a very long time. I unfortunately feel it has gone downhill fast since the pandemic. Slower processing, slower to it up my clothing, and what does get put up and sold I am getting close to nothing back. I just recently shopped on ThredUP last week. I received my “hooded zippered jacket”, however, it was a blazer, buttoned, with no hood! Not returnable 😖
Anyway, buyer beware. I’m finished suing the high shipping and rolling the dice. There are other on line sites with much much better options !!",5
1093,"Great experience: I had a great experience on my first purchase, shipping was fast, I loved how the clothes it's well package, from an environment stand point I could go without the tissue paper and I know it looks so nice,   I do reuse it for gifts or crafts but not sure how many people will do that. The clothing looks really nice and exactly as shown in the picture. I wish that the search engine could be improve, adding more categories, etc. Also when I searched for a particular category all other items showed up.",5
1094,"Slow shipping. Measurements inaccurate: I ordered a pair of jeans from ThredUP with a measured 38” inseam, thinking they’d be long enough to cuff (my usual inseam is 34”). They hit me about mid-calf. Probably around 30”. Now, I could return them, but there’s a “restocking fee” and if I want a refund and not just store credit, I’ll have to pay to ship them back. Just not worth it. Their shipping is 5.99, and horrifically slow. I get it if shipping was free, but items take 2 weeks to get to me. Filters could use some more work. Would be great to have a sleeve length filter for dresses. I love the premise of ThredUP but not so much the execution.

Update: another order, another week of “processing” then it shipped. Another week of waiting for shipping and it’s still several states away.",1
1095,"Um..: So really I have no say on if this app is bad or not because I am unable to use it!
The app requires you to sign in off the bat like any normal app but for some reason no matter what I try thread up won’t allow me to sign up… 
I have tried signing up on my computer, phone, iPad and tried to use multiple emails but it just won’t work. I assume it is an issue with the server so I’m putting out this review in hopes you will fix it. I found a top I really liked online but I can’t check out unless I sign up. The top most likely gone by now seen as lots of people saved it. But please get this problem fixed. I would love to use this app and if it’s possible I would love that top, so please please fix your app and online store. 
Thank you.",1
1096,"Great service, app- hit and miss clothing: My friend referred me to ThredUp two years ago, so after regular use I can give this review. Their customer service is excellent, this is big if you’re a Nordstrom lover like me. Clothing is hit and miss, I have bought Designer sandals, Kate Spade handbags. Clothing is personal. Some pieces are home runs, some not so much. That’s one part online reality since you can’t inspect before buying. Returns are easy so you aren’t stuck. Overall- I shop here when I don’t “need” something, and usually I will find something else to round out my wardrobe. Have fun!",4
1097,"Nowhere to find credit balance.: Overall not a bad experience. HOWEVER-you’re trusting them that the process of returning items for whatever reason will be handled seamlessly. The issue is that if you don’t keep track of exactly how much you returned and how much you’ve purchased since, there is no way to find out what your credit balance is with them.  So you could end up purchasing more than what your credit balance is…almost like they do it purposely.  Hmmm… if there IS a way to find out what your credit balance is I would love to know that and will gladly turn my 3 star review into 5 stars.",3
1098,"Could be so much better: The products are fantastic quality, and the prices are great. But showing only 2 views of the item and not listing the garment’s measurements makes it difficult to buy with confidence. Women’s sizes are far from standardized, with wide variations among manufacturers, as well as across US, UK, EU, AU, etc.. I’ve  come across many listings that are incorrectly categorized, have erroneous key words, and descriptions that do not accurately reflect the given item. Considering that shipping costs are fairly high, and many items have restocking fees, having more thorough, accurate product information would be a great help to your customers.",3
1099,"Overall good - some slight improvements: I’ve been using the app on mobile and tablet for maybe a year now. One thing I keep doing is tapping the back button but actually want to go to the filter instead. But when go back accidentally I lose all of my search filters. 

The photo quality of the images could be better. The white items of clothing are sometimes very blown out and hard to see. 

Overall I really enjoy the app shopping second hand. Sometimes things are a hit or miss with sizing but it is what it is",4
1100,"Bargains on new and barely used garments: Very pleased with this thrift shop alternative. Many brands sold both new and gently used and many price points to let us all update our wardrobes. Many sizes and styles to choice from and all returnable unless marked as a final sale. They even have goody boxes if you want to be surprised and let someone else suggest new designs. Everything gets delivered to the door. 
My only suggestion for improvement would be that additional photos of items would be appreciated.",5
1101,Quickly Obsessed!: During COVID I can’t go thrifting in person... but this digital shopping experience has been even better!! I try to get clothes second hand as much as I can; better for the planet and I get to remove my $ from the labor practices of fast fashion. Thredup has a better selection than what I can find in my local thrift shop and I’m shopping some of my aspirational brands now. You can find things that really suit your personal style because they have such a huge selection. Super impressed with the search functionality.,5
1102,Could be perfect: I just recently started using Thredup. Really simple easy checkout process. My only issues are some major ones - the search function is a bit lacking...wish there was a way to narrow searches down to exactly what you’re looking for with a few descriptive words and then filter from there. Also I wish the pictures and descriptions of items were way better so you know exactly what you’re buying. I bought 2 pairs of jeans that were skinny leg where it said straight and stretchy when I expected no stretch denim. If they work on this I’d buy all my clothes on here.,4
1103,"Very pleased: I have a difficult time shopping; I typically end up frustrated or just spending too much time and not getting what I really wanted. With ThredUP I can browse on my own time without the frustration of feeling rushed or on some deadline and I’m saving the 🌏 by recycling. I ordered three blouses 👚 and I was very pleased to see how quick they arrived (within a week). Not only that, but each item fit perfectly thanks to the sites precise measurements and each item was in basically perfect condition. I only spent $38 and got 3 really nice blouses for work! Very pleased 😀",5
1104,"I really enjoy ThredUp!: I have made multiple purchases from ThredUp over the last few months and I honestly really enjoy it. A friend I follow on Instagram talked about why she uses ThredUp to help recycle clothes and not send them straight to the dump and it really made a lot of sense to me. 

Shopping can be a little overwhelming because they have so much stuff but it is definitely worth it when I find what I am looking for. I have had a few duds from my purchases but the return process is quick and easy. I will say that I have received a few items that had holes or stains and that was disappointing. One item was pictured as brand new but when I received it, the strap of the dress was broken and there was a giant stain. It can be disappointing but thankfully you can always return without issue. 

I really like the points that you receive for shopping. You can use them to wave your restocking fees when returning items so that is nice. 

Overall it’s not too bad!",4
1105,"Score HUGE: This APP! has been a huge money saver for me! I have really gotten lucky with finding my favorite brands! Since I know my sizes in those brands I have scored a ton of items! I also feel like helping the planet with buying recycled + not using my gas to drive around town to find my items! Win, win! I recommend at least checking out the APP! The only downside is shipping cost & how long it takes to arrive. Returning is pretty simple & pain free which is nice! Reaching customer service as well is great, they get back to you in a timely fashion. Great shopping site!",5
1106,"Normally good but...: So I have ordered several times from thredup, and I am usually 100% satisfied with the products I receive. However, I recently ordered a swim top in a size small from White House Black Market. I received the package in about a week, and the bathing suit turned out to be from one of those cheap clothing sites where everything is made very cheaply. AND it was a large! I have read that they send the items through several checking processes to make sure the buyer gets what they expect, but how could they miss an off-brand two sizes two big product?? Hoping to get some answers.",4
1107,"Recommended for buying NOT FOR SELLING: So far I haven’t had any issues in buying items from ThredUP. As long as you stay away from last chance items, you’re good. I do however have an issue with the selling portion. I sent in name brand, gently used items. I filled an entire bag with clothes and shoes. Only 14% of what I sent was accepted. They are literally giving me less than a dollar for each item. None of those items are any of the shoes I sent, which included a brand new, tags still attached pair of shoes. Boots that had barely been worn because my child outgrew them so quick. You’re better off going to a local consignment store to sell your items.",3
1108,"Love Thred Up: I have been shopping Thred Up for several years and I can say the quality control has definitely improved. The clothes I receive are in better condition and presented with more care than they were a few years ago. I have purchased some outstanding pieces!

One way Thred Up could improve is by taking interior pictures of the purses and wallets. I really think sales would double if this was common to place. Who wants to by a wallet without knowing what the inside looks like?",5
1109,Used to be awesome: I started using thredup almost two years ago. Initially it was great. They would email great coupon codes often and the prices were reasonable for second hand clothes. Now the prices are outrageous! I usually only look at the Pink brands. These are priced higher than buying new and not rare items either! I have read online reviews about their closet clean out bags. For sending in a whole bag of brand new high end purses and clothes you may get $15. I have never sent in any of my items to sell because I have read the reviews about their “clean out” bags. Overall I would not recommend this any longer. If they went back to the old ways of pricing things reasonably I would gladly start shopping thred again because I used to feel it was a good deal.,1
1110,"Not worth the hassle: I’m skeptical about their process of accepting and listing items. Some of the items listed for sale on the site are atrocious however I sent items that were brand new with tags from fashionable brands that were “rejected.” It makes me wonder if maybe the employees get first pick at the items that are sent in... For example, I sent a dress from the brand Free People with tags still attached showing original price of $99. It was in season and current and I was sure that would be one of the top priced items I sent! They also listed one of my items as “like new” even though it was clearly new with tags and the tag was actually visible in the picture on their site! Seriously they will give you $0.65 for brand new sweaters and blouses. Not recommended!",1
1111,"There needs to be a men’s selection.: I love the app and the company itself but I found myself disappointed that there’s not a selection for men. There is a selection for boys, so why not? I’ve been searching for something nice for my partner to wear to a wedding we’re both going to be at in a few months but we both aren’t sure about high prices on stuff like that, especially since he’s a student and he doesn’t wear suits or nicer clothing that often, it would be nice for him to find something appropriate to wear at a reasonable price like all the other garments available to women and children on this site. Having men’s clothing would help expand your customer base for sure. ($$$!!!)",3
1112,"Sellers Beware: ThreadUp is a dream for buyers and a nightmare for sellers. I have sent in two bags with wildly different experiences. I sent in one bag a little over a year ago, entirely Free People and J Crew clothing, and they sent me back $53 upfront. Reasonable. All and all ended up making about $90 on the bag, after all the other items sold. Recently, they changed their system for how they accept clothing. This time, sent in a larger bag with all newer Free People and J Crew clothing, and received $7 upfront. I have a total that I “could make” as $30 for this bag. I would have sold everything elsewhere if I knew the payout was so small. AND it takes over a month for them to even look at your bag, and another 14 days after that to cash out your earnings. Don’t waste your time, there are better options out there.",1
1113,"Love, but new update makes images grainy: ThredUP has been my go-to place to shop! All of my ~10 orders have been high quality, and returns are super easy. I have one piece of feedback for the developers though — since the latest app update, the images have been much lower quality. Anything striped or textured just looks grainy, so it’s hard to shop without clicking and zooming in on the item to see what the texture/pattern actually is. Would love for the previous image quality to be restored! It makes my shopping experience much better.",4
1114,"Fun, fun, fun: I’ve thoroughly enjoyed shopping and purchasing unique items from ThredUP. I do have a “concern” though…very often your size “small” tops will list as 36” to 40”, which is a medium or even a large. A size small in any retail store is 32-34”. I’ve read your info on sizing. I’m a size “small” or size 4.  My experience is  But, “small” is small.  You’re description of many size S are as small as 23” !  

I won’t purchase when an item is listed as Small, but the description is for a medium or large. Thanks you, Lori",5
1115,"Better pictures and more detailed descriptions needed: I love the concept of ThredUp, however I have ordered items that I had to return because the description was not very clear I wish the descriptions would be more detailed. For example, I ordered a pair of Warby Parker sunglasses. They make several styles and the styles aren’t listed. That would be helpful since the different styles can be different sizes. The sunglasses I ordered are way too small for my face. The photos are OK but because they’re on white mannequin it’s hard to get a clear image of the clothing item.",4
1116,"Glorious but with glitches: I love, love, love everything about the shopping part of ThredUP. The selection, prices, ecology etc. etc. My one and only gripe is that when something goes wrong (they ship the wrong item as one example) you are completely STUCK. I am a very frequent shopper and seller. Mistakes happen and they are infrequent but if/when they do, it is IMPOSSIBLE to reach customer service. This has happened a couple of times but I love everything else about it so I try to not let it bother me.",5
1117,"Best online shopping experience ever!!: During Covid-19, there weren’t a lot of store open. Most of them were closed and to be honest, who really wants to leave the house now? Not this girl. I work 5 days a week. With for 9.5-10 hour days. This has been a huge help when shopping for restocking my closet full of bargain priced goodies. And best part, easy returns if you don’t like the clothes you’ve purchased. Thank you ThredUP for this experience. You guys are the best!  It has been a life-saver! Happy shopper! Keep them coming!",5
1118,"Addictive shopping: I fell in love with this website many years ago when I was a grad student with a tight budget but a high professional attire expectation. I love how you can get good quality clothing, shoes etc. for very low prices. The only criticism I have is I miss being able to stack discounts/coupons. Long ago you could, now you can only use one at a time. It would be nice if you could pair free shipping and a % discount. Other than that, it’s fun to see how much you saved in the order confirmation lol",5
1119,"Quality dropping/ prices climbing: I have fun using this app to find great deals and have been for many years! but I’ve been having more and more issues with poor quality and significant damages to items that are NOT described and do NOT fall into their description of “good condition with minor wear on fabric “ . I receive boxes of clothes full of holes and stains not fit for the Salvation Army and their customer service (which used to be much more helpful) is increasingly rude , dismissive and unhelpful. 
Items are being priced much higher than they should be (sometimes over retail or exactly at retail) and arrive in extremely poor shape.",3
1120,"Great quality & trustworthy company!: ThredUp has proven trustworthy as all of the clothes I have purchased are exactly in line with the detailed condition they provide. Everything I have received has been great quality and from great brands! I truly do not have the urge to shop in a mall again knowing I can get better quality items for a cheaper price on ThredUP.

Update: I want to still be a fan of ThredUP. However, the service provided seems to be going downhill with long processing times for orders and clean out bags.",5
1121,"I’m in Love with Thredup!!: I have been ordering from THREDUP for years! Every time my order comes, I am always happy with what comes! I’ve NEVER been disappointed. They are very picky about what they take and sell. Items I’ve bought have said it has a flaw or something wrong with it, hence why it’s even cheaper, but the problem I have is that I can’t ever find the flaw! Things are ALWAYs perfect! If you want name brand clothes or shoes or whatever, this is the very best place to buy. You won’t be disappointed! I LOVE THREDUP!!!❤️❤️",5
1122,"Payout/selling sellers beware!: The payout is unbelievably low. Clothes that were seasonal and with tags were never accounted for. Miss Me Jeans that we’re worn once, Gap, Juicy, all better brands and like new condition not accepted. I’ve probably sent 200 pieces of clothing over 3 bags and have less than $20 total credit. Sell your clothes elsewhere unless you just want to give your clothes to ThredUP because that’s basically how it pays out. Love the selection but I almost feel guilty purchasing again knowing thredUP has taken advantage of other sellers to list. 
Shame on you ThredUP!",5
1123,"Thrift from your couch.: Im rating 3/5 bc i feel like people don’t take 5/5 reviews seriously. But I’d definitely rate it 5/5. It’s pretty awesome and I don’t write reviews like ever. I’ve been using ThredUP for a little bit and it’s pretty good, there’s ENDLESS options of clothes. You can pick a filter that shows only clothes in your select sizes so you don’t have to sort through so much. The prices are really good and the descriptions and pictures are great. You can also sell your own stuff too. It’s sustainable and I highly recommend if your looking to thrift clothes but can’t really go to a thrift store. Its more organized than Poshmark and cheaper than Depop. Highly recommend
🤠✌🏾",3
1124,"Ethical and environmentally friendly shopping!: I adore ThredUP. I love that I can buy quality secondhand clothing; keep up with the fashion trends while helping the planet! The app is generally easy to use and navigate. The only critique I have is that it can be a learning curve figuring out redeeming points for certain promo codes before placing one’s order. There also isn’t a way to use multiple promo codes for one order, which would be a nice feature to have. I did have a positive interaction with customer service though, so definitely go to them if you have an issue with an order, points, anything!",4
1125,"THE worst: I would give this company a 0 if I could. Everything takes forever, there is no clear communication, and it’s basically just giving them your money to sell the clothes. Use Poshmark or anything else before you use this company. I did the reformation return and thought I would get rid of a couple things first to try it out. My clothes had tags and had never been worn and they only took two things and supposedly “recycle” the rest and they sold instantly. It took over a month and two emails later to receive my $8 earnings. And every time I would message them I’d immediately see the process move along as if it wasn’t even going to happen unless I messaged them. Don’t do it. You’re better off selling them yourself or recycling yourself.",1
1126,"Great: You may not make as much actual money than you would selling on your own on resale apps and websites, but it saves you the hassle of photographing, promoting, packing, mailing, and having clothes taking up room in your home. They will donate what they don’t want, so you don’t feel as guilty for over shipping. They photograph each piece and detail the amounts they sell for and your payout. I personally got about $35 in store credit the first time I sent them a bag, and have made about $3 cashable. This was just one bag. Recommended to anyone who has too much clothes.",5
1127,"Good with great potential: ETA: returns are a problem. The timeframe is too small and they charge for return shipping - plus they’ve added a new “restocking fee” per item on returns. Really souring me on what should be a great service.

I've been trying to buy my clothes more ethically while also keeping to a budget. Thredup is just what I needed! I love being able to sort by size and color as well as clothing type. It's like sifting through an entire high quality secondhand store without leaving my couch. One request: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add a tag for clothes with pockets! The photos often make it impossible to tell whether a garment has real pockets, fake pockets, or no pockets at all - and that is a MAJOR function question for so many women. Much appreciated!",2
1128,"Really disappointed in ThredUP: I started out really loving ThredUP.  I was able to purchase several decent pieces for extremely affordable prices.  Very quickly, however, prices have been steadily increasing and the quality of pieces and accuracy of their descriptions has been steadily decreasing.  I have recently received items described as “EXCELLENT CONDITION- COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR BRAND NEW” yet they were stretched out, stained (large, unable to be removed), or even torn.  On top of that, customer service has been less than satisfactory when dealing with my complaints.  How on earth is it reasonable to charge someone $2 to send back an item that was absolutely not as described?  While I still believe in shopping secondhand, I will not be recommending ThredUP to any more friends, and I will be encouraging them to look elsewhere.",1
1129,"Amazing concept!: You may not get as much money here as you would on Poshmark or eBay but you don’t need to worry about all of the work, and the clothes that aren’t excepted go to a good cause. Plus buying from their selection is super easy. I have had one or two circumstances where what I have purchased has been different than advertised but with their huge selection some mistakes are bound to be made. Besides, you can actually return things to this site with no hassles! I have been using this App forever and have been very happy with it!",5
1130,Love ❤️: The prices aren’t quite as good as a real thrift store but this is my go to for trip shopping. I just purchased a week wardrobe for my next vacation and I can’t say enough good things about thredUP! The best part is being able to get styles that might not be available in your local thrift shops. My only criticism is the mannequins they put the cloths on are so slim it’s hard to judge if something will fit you. I’d like to see more human proportioned mannequins. This way we can get a better idea of how the cloths drape on a real body. What looks like a cinched waist blouse online might make you look like a curve-less board in person.,4
1131,"It makes so much sense!: While curbing excessive shopping is totally on each of us, it makes so much sense to have an online store like ThredUp, that helps extend the life and utilization of quality garments and keeping them away from the landfill for longer. Plus I could have never afforded a lot of those brands on first hand rates! I have been shopping here for a while now, and I get it wouldn’t be an easy job managing all the collections and curating them so nicely. So, yeah… i appreciate the business! 🙌",5
1132,What you see is not always what you get: When you buy a purse and you see it in the picture does not mean it’s going to hang like a purse. You will have to fix it yourself to make it hang like a purse yourself and pants just because you want pure black pants does not mean your going to get them they will give you what they have to much of . And make you pay for it. And then you have to pay for retuning the items that the made the mistake on and plus they never call you back. Better to go to thrift shop you actually can see what your paying for. Don’t become lazy . And every penny counts with me and I want what I want not what some company is pushing me to get and charging to return the item when they made the mistake .,1
1133,"Want to love but search fails: I want to love this app and want to spend all my money on it but the search engine fails. You search for a waist size, say, 33 inches and you get all sorts of sizes, making you have to comb through every single item to see what the measurements actually are. Also when I search for “high rise” waist and get a lot of mid rise. It takes hours to find items that match what I’m looking for. Accordingly, sometimes items that come to me are much bigger or smaller than the measurements indicate and that is super frustrating because I have to pay a restock fee for an item I would have never bought if the measurements were correct on the site. Nice idea but the execution is just not there. :(",1
1134,Could be great: I love that there’s a wide selection of stuff but the way you find it is a bit complicated. It’s not like eBay where you can type in what you’re looking for you have to search it through category. The lack of pictures is disappointing. The measurements can be way off for some things… jeans for example. I think the name of the jean/short should also be mentioned in the description aside from just saying straight leg or skinny because most jeans and shorts have specific names to them and I feel it would help sell them better if people knew exactly what they were.,3
1135,"Love: I love thredup and the app which is continually improving and assign helpful features. This is really specific but important for ordering online when you can’t try things on. I’d like to make a suggestion that you add waist measurements for skirts. I’ve been buying long skirts to try and the only measurements listed are length.

EDIT - a few more suggestions.
It used to be I could tap the brand name on an item listing and it would show me everything from that brand but now it doesn’t do anything.

It would be nice to have a feature that shows you a mix of items based on your style, or even a stitch fix type of profile you could make and use as a saved search.

Lastly, I wish the search feature was a little more sophisticated. The filtering is good, but if I wanted to search ‘band T-shirt’ or ‘floral pants’ the results are disappointing.",5
1136,"Where’s my order: I placed an order on August 28th and as of this date (September 12th) I still have not received the order. In fact, according to the website, my order has been sitting in West Virginia for nearly a week. Also there is no guarantee that you are going to get items you order. One item in my order was a skirt. On Friday, I found out the skirt was refunded. I never received an email regarding the status of the skirt from Threadup. I found out by checking my credit card statement and discovering a credit then searching the order to see what was refunded.  I have been imaging someone in West Virginia walking around in my skirt. I wonder what will be refunded next?   In my opinion, Customer Service and delivery are horrible!",1
1137,Great app!: I shop on here all the time! I love how you can see the condition of clothing and search for company names. It is also very easy to send clothes to thredUP. The only problem I have is that delivery took up to a month and it said it would only take a couple weeks. I don’t really care about how much time it takes in general but to wish the dates were more planned out and correct. I’m not even sure if this problem was thredUP’s problem or FedEx’ problem so I still have it 5 stars.,5
1138,"Wanna Give 5, But: I have had a good experience for the most part. However, I wish you would take more pictures. Some of the prices seem high for used or second hand clothing. I do like that you have a favorite button and when there are sales or coupons I can purchase my saved items. I have some clothing that I have purchased that were very worn out, but price nor the description indicated that. I rather not have to return, but I have no problem doing so.",5
1139,"The apps functionality is fine.: If you need help from customer service, think again, the customer service team are basically useless. As far as the service,  Bags of clothes sit inside warehouse for months before being opened. Then when items are listed they are listed as “could use a washing” or something like that. What do they expect?  Also I’ve noticed that sets are never actually sold together. Pajamas were sold as street clothes.  A sweater I sent was listed as a sweater. There are Lots of little things that tell me this company does not care about details or their customer base.",3
1140,"My favorite new shopping app!: As a stay at home mom returning to work full-time I needed an entire new work wardrobe. I didn’t have thousands of dollars to spend on new suits and dress shoes, and that’s when I heard of thred up. I have not had one bad experience with it, and everything that I have ordered has been exactly as described in the original listing. I now have a whole new work wardrobe, complete with dress shoes and belts and have spent less than a tenth and what I would have spent in major department stores. I highly recommend this company and this app.",5
1141,"Love thredUP: I love thredUp and am obsessed with it. The only thing that bothers me with the app and that I would love to see change is that you are unable to filter or sort your favorited items. 

Since I am obsessed and spend a lot of time favoriting items, I have so many items in my favorites. It is difficult to scroll through the forever list of my favorited items to decide what I really want to purchase, when ready to make a purchase. I would love to have the option to filter or organize my favorited items, it would make shopping in the thredUP app that much more enjoyable.",4
1142,"Good deals when buying- patience when selling: I have purchased a few items from Thred Up and was really happy with my experience. I returned some and it was super easy. The clothes were in like- new condition. I can understand why they are choosy when buying clothes. 
I have sent in a bag of clothes to try to resell and was really honest about how i’d feel if i purchased this item.  
The iffy clothes i sent in for donation. Thank you Thred Up for handling that for me and helping me clean out my closet. 
They are doing the best they can during these times as well. 
This website helps us recycle and repurpose our clothing!",4
1143,"Lost sales due to no questions: I love shopping at threUP! I’ve gotten 3 orders from here. Most items are as described.  I like repurposed clothes, but hate the consignment store smell.   There is none of that here!   I would give 5 stars if I could ask sellers a question. The coats (which I shopped for yesterday) have no measurement guidelines to them and I found that worrisome for shopping and ordering. I also believe that when there is a notation of damage to an article, it should be required to post a picture of the said damage. The description: “scratch” is very vague and not worth taking the risk.",4
1144,"Good but needs improvements: I love this app. It’s fun to look at all the new merchandise and I’ve bought some great prices. That said, they’re style “experts” sometimes do a poor job of sizing. I stay away from the pants because the title may state size 29, for example, but the description states something completely different. I don’t mind returned as they make this super easy, however you don’t get your full money back which is a problem if there was a sizing mistake made on their end. But more often than not my purchases have been good so I’ll keep going until there’s a major screw up.",4
1145,"Payouts are declining: I started using the app over a year ago and the payouts seemed to be better. I have sent in 4 different times and each time they are less and less. They also seem to donate more out of my bag. At this rate, I would rather just donate it at home and keep the items in the community.

Also between bag request, receipt, return, processing, and posting is about 2 months. The seasonality of the clothes becomes an issue when turnaround is that long. 

The concept is a good idea but the execution needs some improvement!",5
1146,"Decreasing Deals: I’ve been using ThredUP for several years now and have been mostly happy with my purchases, and if I wasn’t, it was ok because I could send them back for free! Well, not anymore! Now every time you return an item they charge you $1.99. Doesn’t seem like much, but it adds up if you do a lot of shopping with them. Also, they use to put measurements on their items, but now it’s only about 10% of the time and the rest of the time it’s just a size! So, now not only do I have to pay to return items that don’t fit, but I have less chance of knowing if they will fit!🤔 Plus, a lot of their prices have gone up significantly. I’ll just take my money and shop elsewhere, thank you!",2
1147,"Mixed feelings: The app itself is great and easy to use. BUYING from this company is great, affordable and trustworthy. SELLING on the other hand is awful. I understand they are here to make money, I respect that however, They took over a month to process my items, they kept three things, and I received $1.15. These items were listed for at least $7.00 each. I was very surprised by how little hey paid out. Hey don’t give you an option to pass on the payment so you’re stuck with it. If you’re trying to actually make money DO NOT SELL TO THEM. If you’re trying to get rid of clothes and don’t care about making any money than this is the company for you.",3
1148,"Love it!! Some clothes smell…: I absolutely love this app! It is the perfect way to thrift without dealing with no so great store and eh employees. Plus you are saving the environment! Only one critique is that the very first time I ordered the clothes smelled like pet odor… the pants didn't fit me as-well so I ended up returning them. The smell most likely would have came out in the wash. But I reordered a pair or pants that fit and no smell, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEMM!! They are Madewell jeans that I got for like 75% if not more off!! I am so glad I found this app!! (I found this app through Mia Maples 😂)",5
1149,"Last try I am done..: Sadly watching my expensive clothes being sold and I am only making pennies. Not worth my time to sort and gather:( 

They paid a low but fair price at first. Now they are giving me $.70 for $100 plus new clothes and they are selling on line for $13. I could have sold it for that at a garage sale and saved my time.  Or not bother sorting at all and take all to charity for better right off OR made more at our local retail shop!! Also they are asking $16 to return items that they don't take...but when I didn't pay for return a Coach purse didn't show up as an item for sale and I have no idea who walked away with it!  I am done, sorry I had previously recommended to friends. ThredUp has changed a lot since I first found them...no longer a win win.",1
1150,"Prices have increased: About 9 months ago, I began using ThredUP. I went through a phase where I’d order constantly and found some very nice pieces. About 2-3 months of not ordering, I went back and scrolled through and found that their prices are much, much higher. For example, a few months back, I bought a pair of active pants for $30... now those same brand active pants are running anywhere $40-45. 

This goes against their “Sorry, we messed up” email from January. Their prices are NOT lower; they’ve hiked them up to the point where I’d rather buy new items from TJ Maxx/Marshall’s or wait till items go on clearance and buy them at almost the same price as ThredUP’s. 

Another thing I noticed: I returned a few items due to not liking the fit, etc., only to find the EXACT item (same picture, description) I just returned at a higher price point days later. WHY?! 

I’ve been really turned off by their handling of things. I love the concept though I wish they’d pay out more to people sending their clothes in to sell, and I wish their prices were more reasonable.",2
1151,"Love the concept Despise the App/Site Quality: I love the clothes, great customer service, but their App & site are Horrendous, poor quality, it was great at first my favorites displayed, I had choices of clicking 'shop similar items' . But after just barely ONE month of use (One!!!) My favorites do not show, only when it wants to, my shop similar items option disappeared in a black hole, I tried deleting the app & downloaded it twice, but it just S@#*. I let costumer service know, but its been over 5 days now. By having a poor quality site/ app they are not aware it makes it harder for the buyer to want to go back & use their site. Its frustrating & I guess it doesn't matter if it has not been fixed yet.",2
1152,"Do not send your items: This app is ok for buyers. I had been a buyer for years. I decided to do a major clean out of my closet. I sent them 5 Home Depot Medium sized boxes completely full. Majority of the clothes were business attire all major name brands. And 40% still new with tags. 
First I noticed they did NOT list everything I sent. They only listed about half of what I sent. Second was the percentage that they tell you is not what you will get. A James Peres dress New with tags you will only get 10% of what it sells for. Then the process is long you will not receive any funds until after the buyer has received the item and 14 days has passed. 
Also they do not list the items correctly. A suede skirt they listed it as leather. Which obviously if you’re a buyer. There’s a high chance they will return it. 
The workers there are able to put something in the No bin and it’s a free for them. 
I regret sending them so many items. 
You’re better off taking them to a local consignment store. 
Never again will I send them anything. I am questioning even being a buyer.",1
1153,Best ever: Great deals and the app is so user friendly and easy to navigate. So fast and easy to chat with an online associate and they are super kind and helpful and accommodating. I actually prefer used clothing and shoes this is my favorite app. Orders and returns are super easy. The more you order the more incentives to order more. The only criticism would be the measurements are only as accurate as the person measuring and the dress forms are all different sizes so you sometimes have to gamble on if an item will fit.,5
1154,"“Returnable” items aren’t and good luck getting ahold of anyone: I received my order and a few things didn’t fit despite being in the sizes I normally wear. But they were *not* marked final sale, so I head over to the returns section to start a return, only to get a message saying that I don’t have any items eligible for a return right now. Hmmm. 

Ok, fine, I’ll connect with customer service. 

So I click on the chat link. Which opens up an email window. I figure I accidentally hit the email link. Nope. It *was* the chat link. So I click on the email link, thinking maybe someone on their development team got confused. Nope, that’s also the email link. So I sent an email, but got no response. 

But they also say they have Twitter customer support. Ok, cool. But, no, they don’t, because I haven’t heard back from anyone there, either. (And I even sent a smiley face.) 

So I guess the next time I want to spend $130 on thrift store items — which, y’all, is no small number when it comes to resale shopping — I’m gonna keep it in my own backyard, where they’ve got, y’know, dressing rooms and stuff.",1
1155,"love me some thread up: One of my favorite online shopping apps and truth be told,  Im sort of addicted to it.  Some of my favorite wardrobe pieces were found here and I love the extensive filters to narrow exactly to the brands, sizes, colors etc...  I love.  Bonus..  Awesome packaging presentation upon arrival.  Only question is... how to apply earned points to orders after you redeem in your account?  Also easy return options if an item doesn't fit right. but i've only returned a couple of items in years of shopping here.",5
1156,"I do 90% of my clothing shopping on here: and I have for several years now. It is my go to for tops mostly, but also work clothing and dresses. I have recommended it to several friends and everybody loves it. The redeemable awards are great, the quality is amazing, and overall I have zero complaints about this company. I will say the only slight annoyance is that I wish there were more details about the clothing, and pictures. Sometimes it’s very hard to tell what a piece looks like so I just skip it.",5
1157,"Get ready to have a new addiction!!: I can’t stop!! I despise shopping and my closet was, key word “WAS”, lacking color, lots of black, grey, & white. Having been a retail manager and supervisor, I can’t stand to go shopping. ThredUP has brought my man and I soooo much happiness, I’m no longer plain and boring, he loves the dresses that I’m finding as well as the pops of color & prices! ThredUP has also made it very easy for me to fully update my teen daughters wardrobe! Our only complaint is that there’s no mens stuff, my man and son would be all over it if there was 😔
THANK YOU FOR YOUR AWESOMENESS!!!!

1158,"Cart: Hello! I think the idea of Thred Up is so great and 6 months ago I would have given them 5 stars but shortening how long you can hold items in your cart to 4 hours definitely lowered their ranking to me. I like to place things in my cart in the morning, think about them for a bit, and usually place my order in the evening but now mid day I lose my cart and I don’t have time to get back to it till evening so half my stuff is gone. They had the process perfect at 24 hours but you could get notified whenever something you liked fell out of someone’s cart. Hopefully they change it back!!",3
1159,"Wonderful!: I recently made a new year’s resolution to either invest in sustainable clothing or buy second hand. I am so glad I found ThredUp because I live in a small town with very little thrift shops/second hand stores and I was weary about throwing all my money into expensive sustainable clothing brands. ThredUp has made “thrifting” easier and accessible! There are a lot of pieces to sort through, but you can definitely find some gems for great prices. Sometimes I am so amazed at price drops for pieces that are still in great condition! Highly recommend.",5
1160,"Good clothes: I love ThredUP! They have lots of options of clothing, including children’s clothing. I have used ThredUP for the past year and have bought all of my clothes and my kid’s clothes from here. There have been times when the clothes are too small or mislabeled. And there have been a couple of times that I have ordered something and a button was missing or there was a hole, but that’s what you get for buying second hand clothes. Overall this app is amazing and I will keep using it.",5
1161,"Great Customer Service: I read a review about poor customer service and was astonished. I’ve had a few issues with items over the two years or so that I’ve been a customer and have ALWAYS received GREAT customer service! Every email has been replied to in a reasonable amount of time, depending on time and day of the week. My only complaint would be that there is no customer service phone number. I’m all about instant gratification and would prefer to speak to a live person now.
I love this company and the concept!",5
1162,My favorite: Nothing compares to the love of searching endlessly through crammed thrift store racks but thredUP comes extremely close! I have found my most favorite clothing pieces through this service. Obviously not everything is meant to be and not all pieces fit or look the way i want but my overall experience has been fantastic. And the customer service is great! On one occasion my card was accidentally charged multiple times and they took care of it so quickly! Highly recommend :),5
1163,"Love ThredUP: I found out about ThredUP while listening to the Vanished Podcast because ThredUP was sponsoring an episode. The premise of getting stylish, quality and gently used clothes at an affordable intrigued me and I’ve been hooked ever since. I just placed my third order since December and submitted a clean out bag! I love the variety of top brands that are available and the ease of using the app for purchases. It’s also nice that I’m doing my small part to  protect the environment by buying secondhand. If you haven’t tried ThredUP I highly recommend it! You will not be disappointed.",5
1164,"Good...but room for improvement.: I honestly do love the items on ThredUP. They have some really great pieces at some really great prices! My complaint is mostly just with the return fee(s). And the fact that if you decide to sell, and send in your items, whatever items they decide not to sell you are responsible to pay the shipping for the items back to you. Furthermore they decide the sales price for your items; which is good and bad. Good for the customer because they can get some great deals, but could drastically reduce the sellers profits. So 🤷🏼‍♀️",5
1165,Amazing!!: I bought a ton of athletic gear on thread up and one of my four boxes arrived today. It originally was supposed to come in tomorrow so I was pleasantly surprised and very excited. Opening the box felt like Christmas morning since everything was packaged and folded really nicely with polka-dotted paper. I am very impressed with all my items. I’ll admit some of them are slightly different color shades than what appeared online but they’re all still very cute and fit well so I’m a happy customer. Will definitely be buying from them again in the future.,5
1166,"True to their word: I have made two orders so far from thredUP and each time so far has been a good experience. The descriptions of the clothing is spot on, they don’t sell anything that is in bad condition. 

One of my favorite most complimented shirts is from here. I love telling people where I got it. I feel like thrifting is really popular now but I hate scavenging through racks. 

I ordered a clean out bag and am sending it in in the next week. I will update to see how that goes. The directions on what they keep and how it works seems pretty straight forward.",5
1167,"Questionable reviews: My review has been deleted twice.  Here it is again: As with most self regulation consumer review boards I question the validity of reviews posted and lack of negative reviews shown.  Especially the lack of 3 negative reviews that do not appear on this site that I know were placed by others.

That being said, I’ve had 3 experiences with ThredUP and they were all negative.  After sending 2 bags to them with some having the original tags I made a total of $3.40.  One of the items that was in the 2nd bag I didn’t get credit for but found in for sale in their app and it sold.

I would of had better luck taking the items to Goodwill or Savers.  At least there when they sold the money would of helped people in need and I would of gotten a tax write off.",1
1168,"Complete waste of time: The process is not worth the results. Such a complete waste of time. The process is confusing and tedious. I had to wait 2 months for my bag to be processed. I sent in 11 lbs of clothes from stores like urban outfitters etc. that were all in perfect condition, some with store tags still intact. I simply didn’t like the style and had only worn the items a couple of times. My selling results finally came in & pay out came out to only $6.88. Also, you don’t receive the payout until ALL of your items are sold on their site. So not only did I waste time carefully selecting items to send in, waiting 2 months for them to be processed, I am not even able to cash out my pay out amount. I regret ever downloading the app and wasting the tape to seal the box.",1
1169,"Beautiful high quality clothes for cheap prices: I was actually shocked at how good my package ended up being after I ordered. The descriptions on the items matched perfectly, if not better than mentioned! The shipping took a little longer than expected but it was still under 2 weeks, which I personally feel isn’t too bad. The clothing I received was high quality, clean, and almost entirely free of regular wear and tear (which you’d expect from used clothing). Highly recommend!",5
1170,"Awesome!!: I enjoy shopping for everything on one App!!
I have found few treasures that I like them very much. But I have to be honest that one reason why I won’t be given 5 stars is because on my last order I bought this really nice black brand new jeans that I need it because they were boot cut and in the detail shows Boot Leg Cut but so I was very excited . For my disappointment when they arrived they were straight leg  . I still keep them but it wasn’t what I was looking forward to have. Overall I like doing some shopping over here ☺️",4
1171,"Some great finds, but quality control is not what it used to be: I have used ThredUp for years now, and if you know your sizes and your favorite brands, you can get some great deals on here, but the quality control on the items themselves has slipped a LOT. In my last three orders, an item listed as “excellent condition” came with visible stains on the front, back, and sleeves or even holes in the items. Sometimes I can get them out, and sometimes I can’t, and at that point it’s $4 to return it. So I am not using the site unless I get SUCH an amazing deal that it’s worth the $4 return fee if it’s stained. I definitely wouldn’t buy anything that isn’t washable!",2
1172,"Convenient, but needs some updates: I really enjoy TreadUp and appreciate it for being an accessible way to shop second hand. The filters allow you to sort through clothing pretty easily, but I think there could be some improvements. It would be awesome if there was a way to block specific brands from ever showing in a search. The amount of SHEIN I have to sort through every time is insane. This would be much easier than choosing every single brand you would like to see options from.",4
1173,"Unethical business practices: 3 out of the 4 orders I’ve placed all had something wrong with them - wrong size, missing buttons, wrong brand. I will never buy from them again! 

Partner kits for Reformation credit used to be decent. Of course they found a way to ruin that too! A new policy was put in place where we can no longer see which of our items were accepted OR which items sold within the timeframe to be allotted a credit OR the amount of credit we’re getting per item. You are expected to blindly trust that you’re being credited properly for each item . I believe this policy was implemented to prevent us from holding them accountable when they mess up on our kits! Shady business!",1
1174,"Horrible Customer/untrustworthy: I’ve been using ThredUP for years and it has definitely changed. My Clean up bag took 3 years to get processed and posted.  I have two purchases and the one that I really was looking forward too (almost $100) is just lost, it never showed up, but they took my money. I’ve tried to contact customer service and not one person has contacted me.  So basically, they took my money and ran with it. The company they used to ship was also unhelpful and careless.  Every person I have referred will hear about this.  We all work hard for our money just to throw it away. 
If you want to be successful, get a customer service crew to assist in issues like this.  Not an animated questionnaire.",1
1175,"Disappear: Items disappear a lot for no reason. If your cart expires, the items should be shifted below your cart as previous items in your cart. Sometimes after checking that they are not in someone else’s cart, and if they were sold or not—items are not found. I try searching for them again in the search options an narrow my search and they are still missing. Sometimes I have to wait a day or two for them to be found. Items that qualify for the sale promotions day-by-day don’t always retain their sale status throughout the promotion. Lame.",3
1176,"Like the app: Organized and I enjoy browsing and buying. I like that the promo codes are there in items so I can see what the price will be. It’s clean, easy to use, I recently purchased 2 items. I’m awaiting the arrival. Pretty excited. I also said yes to trying out this goody box! So I went and ordered it. It can’t hurt. The prices are comparable to other apps I use when purchasing new and used items. I have recommended this app to at least 5 people in the last couple weeks.",5
1177,"Bad sizing/limited search: I feel like this app was designed by men. There are no sizing options for bras. When I search for my size, 32D, it shows a ton of Small bras labeled “Size S (32D)”. Never in my life have I fit into a Small bra. Even the brand size charts say I’m a Medium. They offer no size chart on this app. It also ignores my size filter if I put a size in the search. Kool idea, but super hard to find things as you can’t filter by much. Needs more organization. Good if you want to just scroll through a mishmosh of items, not if you’re looking for something in particular. Poshmark is way better and female need friendly.",3
1178,Kari K.: I really enjoy shopping at this site. The selection is phenomenal! Making returns is extremely easy and convenient. My suggestion for improvement is that they change the backdrop for white clothing and other apparel such as hats. They use a white backdrop and it’s practically impossible to see the details with white on white. I’ve suggested it before but with no response. I have shopped for various white items but mostly end up abandoning the search because I can’t see the details.,5
1179,"Definitely my favorite Pandemic addiction!: ThredUP has been amazing! It’s allowed me to rebuild my wardrobe after loosing weight without having to leave the house and risk exposure during the Pandemic. I’ve also been able to make room in my closet for my new finds by selling my old sized clothes on ThredUP... win, win! I love that I can input my sizes so I’m not digging through a bunch of things that won’t fit me. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who loves the thrill of thrift shopping and misses being able to shop during these crazy times!",5
1180,"Just wait for it: It took six weeks to credit back into my account what I returned . Mailed it back June 2 and finally saw my money around July 16 or 17.  I ordered an item last Friday and there is still no tracking on it as to when I can expect it (today is Wednesday following week).
I ordered an item off eBay on Saturday and it was tracking by Monday and I will have it here by Thursday . 
I love Thred up but you are still a business despite covid. Hire more people ? Wear masks and shields? It’s beginning to feel inefficient.",5
1181,"2+ years and 20+ bags: I’m happy to have found this app. I send in a bag every few months with my own items and gently worn items from my three kids. Shopping for the kids is even easier! No more stores, I just search my favorite brands for them in their sizes. My older girls ‘approve’ my purchases for them before I order. Total dream for a busy mom. I feel like the selling pricing is fair considering I don’t have to haul anything anywhere. Just fill a bag and done. Plus the recycled element just fits our environmental standards. Thanks for a great app!",5
1182,"Favorites won’t save....later found the solution myself😊: I love the idea and like what I’ve purchased so far, but when I am browsing and saving items to favorites they are not appearing so I am wasting my time. Until this is fixed I will not be shopping on Thread up. Please fix soon and let me know when it’s fixed. 
Thanks.

UPDATE: so I deleted the app on my phone and then reloaded it, and now it works like it should, saving my favorites and saving me time and frustration. So if someone is having this problem, this may be the fix.",5
1183,"Thred-mediocre: Thred-up gives you next to nothing for selling your items. This was fine when they first started the business, other things made up for it. The customer service was also excellent. 
They have changed how they do things, they no longer give a payout up-front, they wait until the item sells to give you your $.50. The restocking fee is ridiculous if you return something as well. I used to make purchases biweekly, but not anymore. I would rather use Stitch-fix - free shipping and returns.",5
1184,"Good deals ... long wait: Love that I can score items for a fraction of the price. I can find hard to find or rare pieces and even get things NWT! 
However, sometimes you wait two weeks from the time the order is placed to get your goods. So don’t expect to start rotating it into your wardrobe soon. So I took a star away for that.
Second star loss was for the fees to return items. One you have to pay for shipping it back. Then there is a restocking fee. So you add those together and weigh if it’s worth it to return... and it never is so the  your stuck with an item you aren’t thrilled about or perhaps doesn’t even fit due to an improper description.",3
1185,"Poor sizing: I loved thred up. You can’t beat the deals. The reason I’m only giving 2 stars is for the sizing team. I learned years ago to ignore the size posted. You could order a size 4 and receive a 12. I started paying more attention to the measurements listed in the details and THEY’RE STILL NEVER RIGHT!! It’s actually easier for me to take my mis fit orders to goodwill than it is to return them... and I’ve lost hundreds of dollars. I’ve finally had it with my order tonight. I ordered 3 pairs of jeans (all same brand/same size). I get that some fit differently than others, but 1 won’t come up past me knees and another could fit 2 of me. It’s just so inconsistent. I’m confident this is my last time ordering from thredup.",2
1186,"I’m happy with thred up: I love thrift shopping. However, it’s become a little difficult since moving to another state with a toddler. We don’t have a car yet so this allows me to thrift from home. Also, it’s not always easy doing long shopping trips with a toddler. 

Prices on the site are a higher than thrift shops but I don’t mind to pay a little extra since it’s online. And usually you can find some discount or sale going on.  Shipping takes awhile but I don’t mind.",5
1187,"Used to be much better: The ThredUP app used to be my favorite method for clothes shopping. It isn’t anymore. Pros: Quality items, okay prices (though they used to be better), easy-to-navigate app. Even checkout is smooth. Cons: All clothing used to list their applicable measurements- chest, waist length, rise. Inexplicably, they stopped doing this. Now they only list size. My chances of something fitting just dropped dramatically (unless I know how each style fits in each brand). Also, their payouts for closet clean out used to be decent. Now it’s not even worth selling my items (previously had $20 payouts, but now got less than $2 for a good number of clothes). I’m done with this app unless they change their new profit model.",2
1188,"Can’t trust the “Like New” claims anymore: I’ve used this app to buy and sell the last few years. It was great at first, but has definitely changed in the last six months. I just bought a designer handbag that was claimed to be Like New on the site. Definitely was not with scuffed and faded corners and worn edges. Handbags are not returnable so I guess the don’t care about deceiving customers. You can do better on eBay where you get more photos and sellers are less inclined to lie because of feedback. I won’t be buying again. Also, the prices for used items have gone up substantially. In recent months I’ve found their prices equivalent to what you would pay for new on sale. It’s just not worth it anymore.",2
1189,"Seller beware: This place is a total scam I sent in a bag and I know what I sent because I keep inventory, items are missing and never posted on the website to sell, and good items too ironically one of the nicest items goes missing, not only that my entire bag is practically sold, over 50$ easily and what’s my payout? So far 59 cents, they do not disclose these mysterious “fees”. Please do not sell your items here if your looking to make any form of profit it’s a joke and clearly a straight up business they can care less about the environment. Please use eBay or even Poshmark yeah you’ll do the leg work but at the very least you will get more profit. Shame on you thred up I will NEVER sell on this app or even purchase any items.",1
1190,"Love, love, love it! 💕💕: I have been using three up for while now and I have many people who have asked where do I get my trendy clothes……I tell them it’s a great place where I can find great deals on designer clothing and make the earth a little greener through recycling used clothing!  Does it get any better?  Yes, it does cause I also can and have sent in clothes that I don’t need any longer and then when they sell I get credit to use for future purchases!  WOW!! That’s fantabulous!  Thank you thread up!!",5
1191,Bad experience: Not the experience I expected! Took over 2 months for my items to be listed then my shoe items that were never worn and by brands like Bed Stu and Freebird were returned to me because they said they showed signs of wear when they were made that way!  I figured if a place doesn’t even know their brands then they probably shouldn’t be pricing things for me.  Haven’t been paid out yet and I sent my items the middle of July.   Very slow and disappointing.   Now I have to pay for shipping as well to get the items back that I sent which will have to occur twice since they don’t release your stuff at the same time to reclaim.  Anyone looking to make some extra cash I would rethink this sight!,1
1192,"Love!: I love thread you. It’s a great place to send clothes your not wearing and a great place to purchase name brand clothing at affordable prices. Everything have been great. Quick shipping and great prices. My biggest complaint is that I have send 3 boxes to be reviewed a d put up for sale. One box was 3 months ago a d the other was received mid May. I know COVID has slowed the process, but not having my clothing up for sale hinders my process of purchasing with the credits received. I hope the sent boxes get turned around quickly and my product sells fast!",5
1193,"Great clothes: I have always loved loved loved this store! The items are EXACTLY as described! I tell everyone about this site, my only issue is how long it takes to get an item. Before bundling , I would order items and they would start arriving within a week, now they bundle and it takes a month, so you can’t order for a special event because chances are you won’t get it on time, I ordered summer clothes almost a month ago, I live in NY, my clothes are expected later this week but it’s now Fall weather so it’s a big disappointment. I would give them 5 stars if it didn’t take so long.",3
1194,"Great... until the latest update: Before the update, removing an item from your favorites list would require you to refresh the list before ceasing to display it. Now, whenever you remove an item, it refreshes the entire list and bumps you back to the top of the page. This is super annoying if, like me, you have literally 100s of items on your list (so it takes a while to scroll to the bottom), and now you have to re-scroll all the way down every single time you remove an item. It was soo much easier to just unfavorite, keep scrolling, then refresh the page once you finished. This new system is significantly more time-consuming and I’m not here for it.",2
1195,"Amazing: I placed my first order with ThredUP and I’m so thrilled with my purchases. Not only are all of the clothes and shoes in great condition (all seems new) when combined with my first purchase discount they’re simply amazing. 
I searched for clothes that are usually out of reach because of new price costs. Every piece beat my expectations. 
Of course I’ve placed a couple orders (that I’m still waiting for) because the site is so addictive and I’m even more excited because I know the high quality of clothes I will be receiving.
Thanks so much!",5
1196,"Absolutely love thread up: I adore this place. Great finds reasonable prices. I’ve never had issues with any of the clothes, shoes, scarves, hats... I’ve purchased from here. I adore the packaging and the paper is such a sweet touch! Save it ladies. Fill your purses you’re not using at the moment so they hold their shape- if you tossed your paper. Works great in boots too. 
Every time someone says, I need some new things but I just don’t have allot of money to go shopping. I send them here. 
Thanks ThreadUp... I’m one happy customer. 
And a frequent shopper!",5
1197,"Eh: I like the idea of the app. You can buy name brand clothes for a decent price. Okay. Great. I’ve bought a shirt or two. However, I wish they posted more photos of the items they list. For reference, typically they only post 2 photos for each item. For shirts, dresses, pants, and many others they post pictures of the front and the back only. If there is a flaw on the item, they really should include the flaw a photo, rather than just talk about it in the description. Idk. It seems a bit fishy?? Maybe it’s just me. Places like poshmark, eBay, etc. let the user post up to 8+ photos and it gives the user a better idea of what the item is.",3
1198,"Best thing since sliced bread: I am addicted to this app! I love the hunt for whatever I’m searching for....sweater, skinny jeans, purses. The app is easy to navigate and I love the selection, there is so much to choose from! The clothes you get don’t smell like the clothes from a second hand store either which is great, and most of the clothes I’ve received have been in great condition. Returns are easy too, even though they do take a while to process. Overall I’m very happy with threadup and will continue to shop for great clothes at a fraction of the cost! Happy hunting 😄",5
1199,"Make sure to use the option to get your stuff back: Recently, I ordered a clean out kit and had several items I thought for sure they’d take and sell. In the past, they’ve taken more than I thought they would.

One of my items was a pair of Rothy’s shoes - barely worn and the exact pair Meghan Markle has. Over $140 in value. I’m selling them because the size is too small for me. Rothy’s makes shoes from recycled plastic! So much for their sustainability messages.

They chose not to sell those shoes. I am horrified! I cannot get them back to sell or give away — because I did not choose that option. It was my mistake, but in the past I thought they demonstrated good judgment.

Due to their poor judgment, I will no longer be using their services.

It may seem like a hassle to list your own items on an app like Poshmark, but that’s what I’ll be doing from now on with items I believe deserve a second home.

I encourage you to not buy from them either, as I will no longer will. How many other generous, sustainability-conscious people have they cheated in this way?",2
1200,"Love Thred Up: I love the whole Thred Up buying experience and in general, I love that I’m buying second hand without having to go through racks on racks of clothes at the local thrift store. I can count on items being in good condition and if there any issues at all like a snag or fading, they disclose them. The app is so user friendly with many details about the items. You can favorite items and as long as no one’s dropped it in their cart, you can go back to put them in yours. Everything ships beautiful and overall, Thred Up is the best!",5
1201,Update is awesome: I’ve used thread up for a few years now but it’s never been easier to use. I miss being able to double tap to like and being able to use the app on my iPad but the pros outweigh the cons. I love being able to generally search for things and having them come up right away. Over all it’s awesome. Amazing finds and great price points. I hate fast fashion but I enjoy keeping up with some trends and this app is huge when it comes to sustainability.,5
1202,"New search upgrades make app 100% better: I’ve always loved shopping on ThredUP, but its search feature was inadequate, to put it nicely. But recently they have upgraded it, and it is so much better! For example, a search I made last night for “patriotic clothing” worked. It delivered star clothing, red white and blue clothing, and USA text clothing, etc. Before, that would have gotten me either nothing or a handful of random items that happened to have “patriotic” in the brand name.",5
1203,"I love it!: If your looking for good prices, quality & love it even more when its brand new thrift items you have found your app! I love hopping on here and getting a cute jacket for a weekend out and only spending 20$!! I’ve also gotten the cutest tops & jeans all in brands like J. Crew, Loft, American eagle, some even had tags still! They even have toddler clothes for my 2 year old! & You can also return stuff super easy. So far I really have had no issues which was unexpected with an app like this 😊",5
1204,"Disappointed: First of all, I was so excited about getting new clothes then I proceeded to check out. Everything said it was going smooth even gave me the dates that it would be arriving. I waited and waited. Nothing came in the mail. I looked on my app, and it turns out everything was canceled and my money was refunded; however,I did not do that to top it off  I went to go re-order everything in the cart kept having things getting taken out of it when I would check out. 
I wanted to relax and get myself some new shirts but I just got a lot of frustration and hopefully this time I will get my new shirts. Everybody claims this a great app, but I have not had luck with it! Hoping my life changes with it.",1
1205,"I’ve bought several times: I wanted to love this company. I tried them several times for purchases. Sadly I don’t think I’ll be buying anymore. The stuff that you buy doesn’t match the description. Says “excellent used condition, barley worn.” 🤣 The stuff comes with major piling or wash wear! It takes forever to get your stuff and trying to reach customer service is a joke all in its own. This company really needs some more people that know what they are doing working there. Your okay if the item is nwt, but shipping takes forever still.
UPDATE****
So still haven’t heard back and it’s been a month almost and still no package or email
Back! This is absolutely awful and will never buy again!",1
1206,"Great app/store: This has been the best thing that’s ever happened to my closet. I’ve never sold my own clothes but from the buyer’s perspective, it’s much more reliable than other online consignment or eBay. They are clearly very selective when they take on items; everything I’ve ordered is practically brand new. Docked one star because I wish they took more photos of their items. For textured fabric it’s difficult to see if it’s a dark color. Plus there is some functionality in the website that isn’t available on the app.",4
1207,"Amazing deals!!!: Great and easy search function. Amazing product selection. From Target to Chanel, you can find it here. I’m guessing they get great stuff from ppl who are just too lazy or busy to sell on eBay or Poshmark. These ppl are usually affluent and have exceptional fashion that isn’t worn that much. And is well taken care of. They want something back but again don’t want to work at listing. It’s a win/win. I’ve been very satisfied with my purchases. ThredUP under sells and over delivers. I’m addicted!!",5
1208,"Overpriced and bad deals: False and misleading prices - you only get any promos the very first time u order anything. Yet all promos/ and deals are shown to repeat customers as incentive to buy.  They say all these clothes are on clearance until u go to pay and can’t add any promos / 40 percent off. If they were trying so hard to get rid of clothes with slashing prices then say nevermind u have to pay $12 instead $6 for a shirt- I wouldn’t have bought it. 

Spent $257 and thought I was going to pay $180 at most. They don’t value costumers only looking for new buyers. Green washing hard core. Also I have tons of rewards but unable to use anything more than a $10 off ( after spending hundreds of dollars this past year) .",1
1209,"Absolutely LOVE ThredUP!!: ThredUP is definitely for those girls that always find a way to pick up a designer or high price item and don’t have the budget for it normally BUT with ThredUPs prices you can make your dream closet! 

I only buy my work slacks from ThredUP since it’s hard to find petite wide leg slacks that fit. I’ve even used ThredUP to find my best friend unique Kate Spade print bags for her birthday. 

I’d highly recommend that every woman download ThredUP to find designer items you didn’t even know were attainable (especially now that they have a Rent The Runway partnership!)",5
1210,"Addictive shopping experience: I’ve always loved shopping second hand - but I’ve also always enjoyed brand name clothing. Those two things can often be hard to combine, but ThreadUp has nailed it! I don’t feel like I’m being a wasteful contributor to the clothing industry, and I also get to enjoy the brand name fashion i love. They’ve made some releases lately that make the experience a bit more fun, but I do with their mobile team would work on their search functionality and algorithms to present shipping options.",5
1211,"Great finds!: I love Thred Up- I get great new clothes and I’m not being dictated to by department store trends! First quality items- I feel fully me! I would like better descriptions (“pull on”, “zipper”, etc. and washing instructions would be really helpful.) Finally, photos of black and very dark items should really have some definition and depth- otherwise it’s a leap of faith that often wastes time and money. 
Otherwise I’m always delighted and excited to reduce waste, gone my own style and save money! Thank you!!!",5
1212,"Old me new: I’ve aged.  I don’t care to shop.  My wardrobe was down to work scrubs and very old, I’ll fitting apparel.  And then came ThredUP.  I love it!  Affordable styles that I like are sent for me to try on and play with.  I actually look forward to wearing them!  It has made me splurge a bit on myself on some other things as well! Shoes and a new purse, a mani and a pedi can only do a girl good!  So ThredUP is not only spurring the economy and reusing slightly used clothes, it’s making me look in the mirror and working with my assets and accepting this aging process with a bit of fun.  Thanks!",5
1213,"Restocking fee: Love thredUP and the concept of recycling/reusing! I feel like the pricing is pretty fair and they have great sale items. Unfortunately I feel like the descriptions and sizes don’t always represent the product accurately. I don’t mind returning items, but charging a restocking fee for an item that was labeled incorrectly or described poorly is disappointing. I ordered a dress in size 14 and when it came the tag read L. 14 is comparable to an XL. I needed to return the dress because it was too small. Just beware of sizing! Will continue to use thredUP unless this becomes a common occurrence.",5
1214,"A great way to recharge your wardrobe!: If you find yourself in a retail store wondering why on earth a simple T-shirt is $50, this is the site for you! They have all the brands you want for those looks that you would like to try out but hesitate because of the cost and the prices are fair. Your items are shipped out within a few days, and the return process is simple. 

You will have to wait several days to receive your items, but for a few dollars more or you can get expedited shipping. You can’t go wrong!",5
1215,"LOVE: I have only been using ThredUP for a week and I already love it! I ordered two rompers and one had said “refunded” so I figured I wouldn’t get it. It arrived yesterday and said “freebie” on the tag due to some minor issues they hadn’t noted. I really like that because they’re small issues I can fix and it showed great customer care! Also, items ship rather quickly, the packaging is cute and I really like the flat shipping cost and returns as well. All in all, I have highly recommended this app to a few friends so far and I will continue to do so!",5
1216,"Phenomenal app!: ThredUP is a phenomenal app that provides gently used and sometimes even new clothing at a discounted price. Not only can you buy from thredUP, you can also sell your items online on their website. You may make good money to use for other things or even site credit to refresh your wardrobe. They have a wide variety of designers and also they offer the top brands! I absolutely love thredUP and highly recommend you check out the amazing app!",5
1217,"Good for some stuff: In my experience, good for: brands and fits that you already know.

No so good for: exploring something new. The photos are often not good enough to see details and I feel this is especially annoying and often misleading for tops and dresses. Details are also not mentioned in the description, thus leading to sometimes unpleasant surprises. All this would not be so bad if they didn’t charge a restocking fee per item, often not making it worth the gamble whether the item you receive actually fits whatever you can see on the picture/in the description.",3
1218,"BEWARE !!!: They don’t post the bad reviews but believe me, this is a zero star company. Thred Up is apparently now run by robots. My return was complete incorrect. I tried calling - they don’t have customer service support. I’ve been on my computer waiting to chat for 2 hours. Another example of a poor business model and terrible service. I’ll never purchase anything ever again. And I’ll throw my stuff in a dumpster before I let this company make another dime off of me. Shame on you.",5
1219,"Poor Customer Service and THEFT: ThredUP used to be a good company. But in the last year they have gone wayyy down hill. First off, they have had one of my clean out kits since April 2022…it is now February 2023. That’s almost a year! I could have sold those items elsewhere and made money by now. Secondly, I have found many of my items that didn’t sell -within their timeframe - being sold on their site, but not under my account. Really nice items like Paige, Rag & Bone, Frame, Anthropologie, etc. Them they disappear. Interesting… 
I always have it so my items are returned back to me. I have asked about these issues with no answer. TRUST ME…DO NOT SELL YOUR ITEMS WITH THIS COMPANY. You will get better PRICES and better customer SERVICE elsewhere.",1
1220,"Thred up has changed my life 😃: I have used a thred up for over 2 years and I absolutely love it ❤️  I get so excited waiting for my polka dot boxes. The ease of returns is so nice. And any time I have a problem it gets resolved quickly in the online chat customer service!  
I could seriously go on and on with good things! I love finding beautiful treasures and I love the idea of buying used!!! 
I also love the ease of putting my unwanted clothing in a thred up bag and sending to them for resale or donations ❤️",5
1221,"Beware!  Customer service doesn’t respond: I have used ThredUP for at least 2 years and absolutely loved the service. In the last 6 months or so, things have changed. I have received final sale items that weren’t as pictured, were incorrectly described, one had a huge hole (not shown on the picture) and one was a completely different item than shown. If it’s final sale, there’s not a way to contest the problem. Chat goes into a black hole and no response. Email loops back to chat.  I also sent 3 clean out kits. It took  months for the first to be processed, about 6 months for the second and the third disappeared off of my account before it was processed.  See above for contacting customer service.",1
1222,"Pitch: “exclude brand ___” filter: I’ve made a handful of purchases from ThredUP over the years and I’m constantly finding deals that are unbeatable!

The app itself is user friendly and pleasant to navigate. I utilize the search filters a lot, especially the inseam filter since I am considerably shorter than average for my size bracket. 

I do wish there was a filter that allowed me to exclude certain brands. My searches could be much more refined and less cluttered with brands I know for sure I don’t want.",5
1223,"Good for me, good for planet: Great app, great product, great idea!  Very functional app for getting info quickly so I can make informed decisions how and when to buy. Saves me time and money. The best functions are the search by “my sizes” so you only find what might actually fit. Also the function where you can get notifications when and how you want info by brand, etc. Top notch app that I use at least daily and save’s me hundreds of $$$$ and I am recycling at same time! What’s not to Love?",5
1224,Clean out bag: I got this app wanting to make some extra cash. when I ordered a clean out bag it took about a month to arrive. When i shipped it out if took FOREVER to get it processed. it definitely did not take “2 to 3 weeks” it took 3-4 MONTHS and out of the whole bag I sent they only put 5 items up. I paid extra to have my bag shipped bag to me and when I got my bag of items that didn’t make it to their site I was missing clothes and shoes that were not on the website nor in my bag meaning they were either gone or stolen. I tried getting in contact with them and of course they yet to reply to my message it’s been WEEKS super highly dissatisfied and disappointed won’t be using this app again.,1
1225,"Need more filters!: Would love it if there were a way to filter my liked items. For example, I’d like to more easily see which warehouse they would be shipping from, that way I can pick some things that all come from the same place. The “my home warehouse” filter for searching through items works fine, but if I’m ordering something from a warehouse which is not my home warehouse, I might as well get a couple more things from that place as well.",5
1226,"Disappointed: I was excited to try thredUP for the first time, but when I received my first order, I noticed a very NOTICEABLE blue stain on the shoulder of a sweater I had bought. I rechecked the product description and there was no mention of a stain. I reached out to customer support and never received a message back. I tried washing the stain out, and it did not come out. This doesn’t leave much me confidence in both thredup products, as well as their customer support. I will not be shopping here again.",5
1227,"ThredUp is the BEST: I love ThredUp so much! Everywhere I go people complement my clothes. It is the best used clothing website there is. The variety is fantastic, the prices are reasonable and the search function is so useful. I can search by designer, by color, by size, by style, by sleeve length, etc etc etc. They have a great feature where if something’s unavailable, their algorithm will show you other items that are like it. Travel down the clothing rabbit hole and have the best wardrobe you’ve ever had with ThredUp!",5
1228,"What a great way to shop!: Found ThredUP through recommendation of a favorite podcast, starting browsing during the COVID-19 shutdown. I had just lost enough weight (thank you WW!) to need a significant change in sizes, and truly didn’t have any jeans that fit. ThredUP allowed me to purchase jeans in a brand that I knew would fit my body but in a new size, and it has been such a good experience! Thank you to all the people who send their clothes in for resale, and thank you ThredUP for having a wonderful website and great customer service. I’m a believer!!!!",5
1229,"Filter for pockets?: I love this service. Thrifting with search capability is a dream, and this has really helped me reduce my consumption and save money. 

This would be the perfect app if there was a way to filter for items with pockets only. Fashion has a problem with not giving women reasonable pockets, and I don’t want to contribute to that, even second hand. Currently the descriptions don’t reliably say if an item has pockets or not, so I buy a lot less than I would if I can’t tell from the picture.",5
1230,"Returns super easy, quality is great!: I have been using ThredUP for about a year. I have purchased pants, shoes, dresses, handbags. The quality has been exactly as described and I love the selection. I have purchased items that turned out to be too small (I am between a S/M) or items that just didn’t look good in me. I simply select the item from the app within 14 days and hit return, tell them why I am returning and they send me a link to a shipping label. Easy! I am very pleased I found them! Oh- and the selection IRL locations is great also!",5
1231,"Love the brands, condition, low prices: ThredUP has really changed the way I shop for my clothes and I especially love searching for the perfect items and handbags.  The descriptions and condition of items is usually spot on.  Occasionally something doesn’t work out quite right, but they’ve made returns very easy and simple.  I love the phone app, works great and after the last upgrade it now matches the website.  I do really like the Buy & Bundle and Auto-Buy, if Available options.  Overall I highly recommend!",5
1232,"Love the concept, hate how the clothes smell: I prefer to buy second clothes for many reasons. The thredUP concept is great and I enjoy looking through their vast selection. I’ve order a few times and generally like what I’ve bought. However, I don’t know if I will continue to use thredUP because of the perfume smell of the clothes. I have to wash items multiple times (4-5) before I can wear them. Synthetic fragrances bother my eyes and sometimes cause headaches, not to mention they’re terrible environmentally. I know too many people who have unpleasant reactions to synthetic fragrances to recommend they use this service. 
ThredUP- please stop using whatever chemicals cause your clothes to smell. I’d love to promote your business.",2
1233,"So far... love.: The business itself:
Pros:
Great for buying. I love the fact that in all the listings of the articles, there are also actual measurements. This is extremely helpful especially knowing not all brands size clothing the same. This helped me ensure everything I ordered fit.. which is something difficult to do even in the store. I like the photos of front and back in great lighting. I like the idea of cheap but nice clothing and not having to leave my house and deal with people.

Cons:
Why aren’t there men’s clothing? You have literally everything except men’s clothes.

The app: it’s seamless, extremely simple to use. No glitches, freezes, or failures. It’s better than most other retail apps also actually. Including targets because theirs freezes and probably just has too many things they want going on rather than keeping their eye on the prize. Great work on this app, guys!",5
1234,Clear out Boxes: I sent my box in and was notified that it was received January 18th it has not been processed as of yet which means it has been 3 weeks since they received the bag. I was sent an email that stated I would have my bag processed no later then February 15th hoping this is true but does not look likely. Like many other people have said I’m hoping my items were not misplaced. I’ve had several complaints that things “have gone missing and not paid out for” when sent to thred up. Hoping this is not the case considering I sent almost 600 dollars worth of clothing in. If I have a better experience once my bag is reviews I may consider revising my rating as of now I’m not super happy.,2
1235,"I used to be a loyalist: I was a heavy ThredUP user until a few months ago when they changed their return policy.  Now their items are subject to a restocking fee.  So not only do you have to accept a credit if something doesn’t fit right, but you have to pay a restocking fee.  So this can get you into a vicious cycle of restocking fees using your original 1st time credit if things don’t fit right.  

I was spending several hundred a month with them previously, and now will no longer use them due to their policy change.  Also if you are trying to sell your items on there... they don’t pay out much.  It’s not worth it.  Sell at a brick and mortar consignment store, on Facebook Marketplace or via eBay instead.  You’ll get much more money.",1
1236,"Mixed review: So far, I have not had any issues with purchasing clothes from this service. When I had a question on an order, customer service was prompt and efficient. However, when I sold clothes through this site, I thought they were undervalued.
Shipping continues to be a mixed bag. It seems to take double the amount of time the email says and the package stays in limbo for several days before being sent to the post office for final delivery. The delivery status isn’t updated and it’s frustrating to figure out when your package will actually arrive.",4
1237,"Ethical, easy and cute!: ThredUP has become the primary place I get clothes for myself and my daughters. We’re trying to live by the rules “local or used” and this site makes that really easy! The clothes are gently used, and I can select brands that I know age well. When items aren’t to my daughters taste when they arrive (she’s slim and very picky about feel) or when I’ve purchased something that hasn’t fit, returns are incredibly simple. I always go for store credit, because I know we’ll use it up! I just requested a clean out kit and I look forward to passing on our gently used gear.",4
1238,"It’s Great But…: As a petite woman, I find it hard sometimes to find shoes. ThreadUp has size 5 shoes in women AND kids. What they fail to differentiate is the size between kids and women’s. I’ve ordered shoes thinking it was women and it ended up being a big kids size 5, which then I was charged for returning something that was not my fault. I do like that they have such a large variety but they need to double check their description and be more accurate on it. It’s quite annoying when we get penalized for their mistakes ($3.99 return fee).",4
1239,"Not worth consigning here!: I used to love thred up before they changed their processes. They no longer pay up front for your items and each item must be sold prior to payout. This is fine except they are now only paying pennies to the dollar, even for name brand items. AND they are automatically deducting the shipping cost of sending your items in from your payout. So despite 15 of my items selling, including some Lulus formal dresses, I didn’t make a cent. Lesson learned. I will be taking my items to a local consignment store in the future. This was a huge waste and I’m really disappointed that after thred up sold my items which in total had originally cost hundreds of dollars my payout was $0.",1
1240,"So helpful and patient explaining the cleanout process to me: Thred Up has been amazing I have sold and bought things with them. I highly recommend them if you have a question it’s usually in the FAQs if it’s not clear to you you can chat or email with them and I was so surprised at the quick response and helpful attitude of, the people that chatted and answered my emails. I highly highly recommend them. I will definitely continue to buy and sell with thredUP Cheryl in North Carolina.",5
1241,"No customer support: This might be a great service if you never need customer support. If you actually need to speak or chat with someone, forget it! I attempted to chat and to email, you cannot get in touch with anyone!! Their chat just keeps looping you back to the same 3 options. You can’t ever actually ask a question. There is NO phone number. I will never buy anything here again just because of their lack of customer service options.",5
1242,"THREDUP IS A SCAM: If you want to make extra cash by selling your designer wear/used clothes, DO NOT use ThredUp. They will take your stuff after you ship your clean out kit with very little to no payment at all to you in return for your items. They are conniving thieves. You’re better off using Mercari, eBay, or even FB. Don’t waste your time or energy on buying or selling anything with them. They don’t even have a customer service phone number you can call for real time or live support assistance. It’s most likely because they know they’ll get nothing but angry customer calls for all their theft and scandalous services. Do yourself a favor and don’t bother with them because all you’ll get is nothing but empty pockets.",1
1243,"Missing info: I have loved shopping at Thread-Up and similar sites, however I have bypassed ordering many times due to lack of information. For instance when looking for a belt I have nor seen the width measurements on any. This is an important piece if information when belt shopping. Too thick will not fit loop holes and too thin can be a fashion mishap. I hope this information reaches management as there is no other avenue that I have seen to relay this. I often get frustrated when not seeing information needed and head to another site.",4
1244,"Huge battery drain!: This app works great in one sense - I really enjoyed browsing clothes on it.

A couple days after downloading it, though, I noticed that my phone was getting super warm and the battery was draining really quickly. It’s a pretty new phone so I was worried. I went and checked in the battery settings - and this app was running constantly in the background and using 90% of my battery power! It was closed and everything. I deleted the app and my phone has been fine. I don’t know what was going on - the app was totally up to date. But I’d consider this when downloading again. I don’t know if they’re tracking or what.",2
1245,"used to love!: I have been using ThredUp since it started. I used to love it but lately I have had so many issues with orders. I’ve had clothes that said they were in excellent condition arrive damaged and unwearable, I’ve had clothes I bought be refunded cause they lost the item, I’ve had packages arrive very late, and clean out kits take over a year to be processed. I would love to keep using this app but there needs to be more people working to keep it running well. Also, can we PLEASE get a waist measurement for skirts?? Idk why this measurement is not provided but makes it extremely difficult to know if a skirt will fit. You have them for pants why not skirts?",2
1246,"I am a huge fan!: I just had my first experience with ThredUP and I’m impressed. I ordered five pairs of jeans for $36. Shipping was quick! All five pairs were in what appeared to be MINT condition. No true signs of wear and tear. There was no unpleasant odor and the packaging was adorable! I did have to return one pair (just a little too small), but the return process was easy and convenient. My return was processed in less than a day. I have already been recommending this app to friends of mine. I can’t wait to order again!",5
1247,"Bad app, service that badly misses the mark: At this point I have to delete and reinstall the app every time I want to use it. Otherwise it hangs forever - literally left it on the loading screen for five minutes, keeping the screen awake, before I gave up. 
ThredUP support is pretty awful, always implying that every glitch is my fault. Sizing is not normalized across different schemes - a 40 Eu and a 40 IT are not the same. Searching is incredibly painful. 
I’m writing this as I delete the app for the last time, because this is the fourth and final time they’ve sent a package to an old address after confirming my current in the app. About a hundred dollars of clothes delivered somewhere I have no way to get them from.",1
1248,Staff are getting lazy: Thredup used to be the best at everything and anything. I know staff/employees are getting tired bcs it’s getting so popular but I wish they’d try better. Measurements are getting wrong and the wrong clothes are sent. And you can’t see some products clearly. You would have to zoom in and have your brightness at max. I wish they’d have lights at the products esp for black colors. You can hardly see anything. The app and website are lacking. I’m still giving this a 4 despite all of that bcs I still love thredup.,4
1249,"Great options for designer baby clothes: I stumbled upon ThreadUp when buying clothes in anticipation of my first little one. Clothes are so expensive and they wear them for such a short time! I was able to get almost his entire wardrobe from the app! I only buy things that are ‘like new’ or new with tags otherwise I’ve noticed that you’ll find stains (which is fine depending on what you need them for).  Definitely check it out, I wish they sold men’s clothes as well.",5
1250,"Great app and great company!: Love, Love, Love ThredUp!  App is easy and quick to navigate.I love the app. I also love the company. I am disappointed about the re-stocking fee. It is really important when buying online to be able to try on items because sometimes they simply don’t fit. The restocking fee makes me less likely to buy something that may or may not fit, like a swimsuit or pants. However, I love the idea of letting clothing have a second life!  It is good for the environment and my pocketbook.",5
1251,"Awesome way to shop!!: I have used thredUP for several orders now and have processed a few returns as well. 
The sales are great and the site always has a large selection of clothing options to get excited about. 
I have made purchases here for name brand gifts, work clothes, gym clothes and luxury handbags. 
The return was easy and when I had questions I reached out to their customer support, they answered my questions quickly and were very helpful. 
This app has won my support and I plan on continuing to buy from them.",5
1252,"Best Secondhand App out there: This app is exactly what I needed! It's super user friendly, great finds, a great way to track what you love (by choosing favorites) and they tell you if it's still available or help you find something similar.  My first order arrived two days prior to expected time frame. It was packed neat and the clothes were folded nicely. They were exactly what I expected from how they were described by the app. They give measurements, tell you what condition the garment is in, ... I could go on for days. Just get the app. You won't regret it!",5
1253,"Cart Hold times: The in cart hold time is currently 24 full hours. It’s extremely frustrating as a potential buyer and even more so if you’re a seller. Customers can fill their carts full of items they’re interested and wait a full day as they decided what they would really like to do. Once the cart expires the process starts all over again. 

If Thred Up reduced the hold time, it would create a sense of urgency. By doing this they’re more likely to make more sales and more quickly. Or at leas her more serious buyers. This in turn would clear up their wear house space and bring in more revenue. 

Please, please, reconsider your cart times!",3
1254,Horrible: This site is a huge rip off.. you sending a bag full of a namebrand items they partially except the bag they offer you pennies on the dollar and they turn brown and jack up the prices to resell it even though it was something that was already secondhand sold to them they disregard tons of namebrand items which I really personally don’t think they disregard I think the employees are able to keep them which means they make a huge profit off of that because they give free stuff from people consumer said just us and then it’s just ridiculous I can’t I’ve never dealt with anything like this and I’ve sold multiple bags and receive bigger payout so now they’re offering five dollars on six items when the bag was over stuff with items,1
1255,"Not Worth It: After our annual garage sale (at which I had sold about $70 in kids’ clothes), I stuffed a Thred Up clean-out bag with clothes I thought met Thred Up’s standards. I sent it off and tracked the bag as it made its month-long journey to Thred Up processing. When it finally arrived, I was notified that my bag would be processed in three weeks. It took more than a month, but then I received some hope. An email alerted me that my bag had at last been processed. A whopping 30 cents. I can’t even cash out because the amount is so small. I’ve looked at Thred Up’s offering, and I have no intention of paying ridiculous prices for second-hand clothes. Summary: Dump your kids’ clothes in the garbage and scour the recesses of the couch for a bigger payout than Thred Up offers its customers.",1
1256,I profited $2.68 off of 13 items they profited almost $200: I was very excited to try ThredUP because I have a closet full of clothes that I’ve been holding onto and do not wear anymore. I’ve worked with consignment stores before so this seemed like something that was right up my ally. Sadly I found myself ripped off and extremely disappointed. A number of the items I sent in were brand new with the tags still on and the other items were in perfect condition. After everything except one shirt sold I walked away with $2.68 while they profited over $200 on my items. To me this seems extremely ridiculous and very dishonest and disheartening. I also reached out to customer service to see if there was some type of error but never heard back.,1
1257,"Returns are a rip off: Buying clothing online has its risks—mostly not being able to inspect the garment yourself or try it on.  That’s why it’s critical online retailers have a reasonable return policy.  I have made smaller orders in the past and had a positive experience. Recently though, I made a larger order and to my dismay not only did I have items with undisclosed snags, i had items that did not fit and some that were simply not as described.  I returned about half my order but was only refunded a fraction of what I paid for those items—and this was after I paid for the shipping (so as to not have that deducted from the refund).  No response from customer service to address the issue.  ThreadUp is a great concept but its execution leaves a lot to be desired.",1
1258,"Saving Money and the Planet: My advice: know your body measurements and the measurements of the clothes you already own and love. You can use those to make more accurate comparisons than the size on the label. Overall, ThredUp is my favorite way to shop. It has a great selection! Obviously, there are the basic brands you would expect (Gap, J.Crew, LOFT), but you can also find gems that you’ve never heard of that are more interesting and fun. Plus, you can buy secondhand, which is more ethical than perpetuating the environmental costs of fast fashion.",5
1259,Do not do clean outs with them: This is by far the most dishonest place to send your clothes and have them sell them. Long story short I’ve sent a bunch of name brand clothes in that they do sell and they were all in excellent condition. They are paying me out enough to cover the shipping on the items they listed and the rest of the clothes are probably sitting in one of the employees closets now because they’re unspoken for. Why would they list one pair of American eagle shorts and not the other 8 pair that were in the same bag and in the same condition. I’ve sent 3 clean out bags completely full and the same thing has happened with all 3 bags. Do not send them your clothes or you will get ripped off.,1
1260,"Great options and a greener way to shop: I love thread up. The variety of clothing is awesome. I am plus size and it’s so amazing to have so many options. Not to mention it feels good to buy second hand and at great prices. Abandon Shein and other fast fashion brands! 

The only thing I would say would help improve the shopping experience is if there were more options for filters under certain sections. Like sleeve length under dresses!

But over all this is my FAVORITE place to shop!",5
1261,"Better customer service is needed: While I enjoy finding clothing pieces through your app, the ability to get help or to even get a customer service rep to assist me does not exist. And even if I try to email your company, it takes days if not weeks for a response. Why have a chat option to begin with if there is no live person to chat with. And sending in my clothes to sell through your site pays out nothing and the process takes so so long. But it’s really not having a customer service rep is the real problem that your company needs to work on.",3
1262,Great for buyers Not so great for sellers: This website has great deals if ur looking to score a cheap outfit however if you are a seller and you are looking for a check equal to what you would pay for these items on the site you will be sadly disappointed! In fact sometimes you won’t ever breakeven! Depending on the shipping and handling you selected initially it could very well send you in the negative if ur not sellingLouis Vuitton purses! Please take a look at the payouts for the items you are sending before you make the same mistake I made and end up paying them to take your clothes!,3
1263,"Love this app!: I absolutely love thredUP!!! I get most of my clothing from the app now. I’ve been shopping on the app for about a year and a half. The only thing that I wish was different was the ability to search for items based on descriptions rather than just brand, it can be difficult to find specific items because of this. However, everything else about the app and service is wonderful. Absolutely would recommend to anyone!",5
1264,"Wonderful App! A bit overpriced: I love ThredUp and all of theier clothing options! They have one of the widest assortment of clothes I’ve ever seen, and finding what you want is so much quicker than in-stores. I will say, however, that for my last order I paid 80 dollars for 4 items. If I were to go the my local thrift  store, I would’ve been able to purchase 4 items for less than 30 dollars. All that aside, I love ThredUp, and I thank the creators forgiving  me a way to be more environmentally friendly while still doing what I love: SHOPPING",4
1265,"Caution to Sellers: I used to love this app, sold so many items and got what I thought was a fair price. The last two bags though I question what’s been going on, and even think they might be stealing items. I sent a Burberry coat that somehow wasn’t accepted along with several other items. Payouts also seem to be getting lower, if the item sells at all. I’ve recently reclaimed items, turned around, listed them on Poshmark and sold them for more profit than if they had sold on ThredUP. While I like the concept, don’t feel they are doing right by the sellers anymore. I used to send clothes here as it was hassle free, I’m taking the time now to manage selling my clothes and seeing much better benefits.",1
1266,"Love it, but..: You can’t go in searching specific things.. It’s just like thrifting irl. You have to “dig” through each category. My other gripe is that I think the pricing is a little high for secondhand clothes. I also would not personally sell with them and expect much out of it. I donate all my unwanted clothes though. I gave 4 stars because this is my go-to app for a special occasion outfit, even if I have to pay a little more than if I were thrifting irl.. I can almost guarantee finding something here, where as the thrift shops are iffy.",4
1267,"Almost perfect —one suggestion!: I love that I can find my favorite brands at great prices. However, I find it frustrating how much irrelevant stuff I have to sort through to find pieces in my size. SUGGESTION: please, please, please add a function that allows us to sort by measurements (in addition to or in place of “size”). I’d love to be able to search dresses by chest size and length, for example, since sizes vary so greatly even within the same brand. If this function were to be added, I think the app would be just about perfect!",4
1268,"Not A Happy Customer: I am one to read reviews. I look into things before making a purchase. We lost our home and everything in it last year. So with starting over from scratch, I tried to bargain shop. After reading the reviews, I was convinced. I purchased items for me and my daughter and man was I disappointed!!!!! After spending $215.?? And receiving my order, I believe I could have gone to the America’s Thrift Store & Did Better!!!! I Will Never Purchase From Here Again!! Never!!! I’m not sure if it was the sellers that were the  issue or Thred Up for allowing them to post certain items for sell without verifying the condition!!",2
1269,"If I could give 6 stars I would: I have been extremely happy with every purchase I have made from ThredUp. Their customer support is unlike any other customer support I have dealt with (I actually dont dread it!). I don’t foresee myself ever shopping anywhere else for clothing. I am more than happy to support their company for many reasons, especially knowing they are environmentally conscious! If anyone were to ask for a reputable online clothing store, ThredUp is the hands down the best.",5
1270,"They lost my clothes!: Do not send them anything you aren’t willing to lose! I sent in a bag of about 25 items.
(Jeans,shorts,dresses,rompers,and a Michael Kors Trenchcoat) After 11 months of emails, because they don’t have a customer service phone number, they finally admitted they had lost my belongings. Do you want to know what they offered me for all my trouble and the 25 or so items I sent?........$34. They said they might be able to give me more if I sent an email with a specific description of each item. I’d already sent them pictures of each item, what more did they need? So I’m just going to warn people to use other online sites to sell their clothes and to stay away from Thred up!",1
1271,"Love, Love, Love!: I absolutely love ThredUP and I love it’s app. I personally am someone who does not enjoy going shopping in stores for clothes and stuff, so finding this site has been a life changer. I’ve ordered a couple things from them and they get everything to you in a pretty timely manner. I also like that they are basically an online thrift store and you can get great quality clothes for a good price! I would say that I hope one day it’s not just geared towards women and hope it will also be geared towards both men and women!",5
1272,"Seller and Buyer Beware: ThredUP charges a huge percentage to consign, and does not treat consigners as partners, and exploits at every turn for their own gains.
They do not provide measurements for all of their listings, and they don’t provide consigners a place to add notes or measurements for an item.  
For example, if you consign a velvet skirt, they do not describe it as velvet, so buyers don’t know.

Regarding buying, the measurements issue is a bigger problem, as the tag size does not guarantee a good fit, and most of what you buy will not fit.
They provide very little time to try on and return items that don’t fit, and they charge a restocking fee. Providing garment measurements could avoid a lot of hassles.
I believe they should also add notes to listings that describe fabric weight, and weave.
For example, it’s difficult to tell from s photo if a fabric is a crepe, or twill, opaque, or sheer.",5
1273,Love this shopping site: I love this shopping site. I miss the days when you use to give the customers a discount on holidays. Like on thanksgiving and the 4th of July. You would give us 20% off. Now there are games to play to get the discounts. I don’t like the games like bingo. It’s not my thing. I used the site more before the games. But I still use your site quite a bit anyways. I have purchased some of my favorite articles of clothing from your site. You guys are still my favorite shopping site. Love you. You rock!,5
1274,"Amazing quality!: This is the second time I’ve bought from this company and both times have exceeded my expectations! From the packaging (cardboard box with teal polka dots), to how it was packaged (clothes neatly folded in tissue paper), and the quality of clothes I’ve received both times is outstanding! My kids wouldn’t know they were used without me saying so. Kids grow out of stuff so fast and places like this and Once Upon a Child help to buy expensive clothes like Under Armor & Abercrombie at a highly discounted price!",5
1275,"I finally feel good about buying clothes!: Often overwhelmed shopping in real life, it take me ages to find anything suitable and when I do, I’m usually settling for less ideal pieces just so I can leave the store. ThredUp offers great filters to view items by material (I’m a huge fan of silk, linen, and cashmere) and uses standard measuring techniques across items allows me to feel comfortable what I’ve purchased will fit. Bonus: awesome prices, amazing selection, and prevents my having to buy new items when my clothes have worn out!",5
1276,"So has improved: The ease of using thred up has improved. You can save items you like, and your cart warns you when it will expire, plus you know when items are no longer available. I make a lot more money selling my own items on other auction sites. 
It just depends on the amount of time and bulk I have to sell that helps me decide on where to go. 
Here, discounts are few. The most discouraging cost about being a consumer of thred up is that the shipping is eating into any desire to SELL or buy.",5
1277,"Great to buy, do not sell: So purchasing from Thred Up is great. I always good quality items at a good price but do not send them your clothes if you want to make any money. They are very picky (I read their guidelines) and couldn’t believe what they sent back to me. Many of the items I sent were brand new and I never wore them but they rejected them.  I ended up being happy about it thought because they literally give you no money back. They’d list one of my items for $15 and I’d get $.70 back. Better off selling your clothes somewhere else if you wanna make any money.",4
1278,"Love Buying Used!: I love buying used from here cause you know it’s going to be gently used and still feel like new. You can help save the environment and money by buying on here. The only downside I have found is that they don’t have pockets as an option to search by. They allow cut outs, glitter, bows, lace up, and other accents like that, but pockets isn’t an option to choose. And as a girl, we love our pockets and know we are always looking for those on dresses etc.",5
1279,"Could improve: Pros: found pricey items sold at cheaper prices than other thrift shops online. Just ordered and have not had a chance to experience the shipment yet. Will add information once the shipments arrive. 

App is a little glitchy but super easy to use and the merchandise variety seems pretty great.

Cons: non-existent customer service so far. I signed up through Facebook which had an old college email that I do not have access to (changed since). You can’t change your email on your own with threadUp, you have to go through customer service. There is no listed number to call. There is a “chat” option which I reached out to twice in the last two days without response. Because of this, i don’t have access to my shipment/order emails and have to go through the app to see my orders. 

I also noticed is that customer service responses to concerned customers have been a bit “passive”, at least the few I’ve seen. I’m hoping that I am wrong about this.",3
1280,"Reliable and easy way to shop sustainably: After finding thredup, I have cut down on frivolous spending at malls and online stores tenfold! Shopping with thredup helps me feel so much more intentional about what I buy and makes it a lot easier to buy good quality clothing at a reasonable price. I tell everyone to shop with thredup. While you may not get “prime next day delivery,” you get peace of mind that your shopping is not harming the environment and is helping end clothing waste!!",5
1281,"Access to so many brands!: Living in a rural area far from major cities means meager access to good quality and fashionable clothing. I have found so many treasures on ThredUp that I wouldn’t otherwise be aware of — and for such low prices. I love selecting my size range and then browsing all the options that ARE available. Returns for items that don’t work out is very easy, thank goodness. I accept store credit because I know I’ll spend it quickly on more gems.",5
1282,"Amazing but needs easier search: This is one of the most amazing apps out there. I wish the whole world would shop second hand. I’ve gotten a $3,000 Ralph Lauren embroidered dress for $50 on here. It still had the TAG!!!!
-
The four stars is because this app needs a better searching service. I wish you could search way more specific, because it takes a TON of sifting to find that perfect item. There needs to be way more key words attached to items.

Love you guys and what you’re doing for the planet!",4
1283,"I almost exclusively shop for clothes at ThredUP!!: ThredUP is simply fabulous. After a major surgery I gained a LOT of weight and basically needed a completely new wardrobe. I also left medicine for a different career path, so I needed a business/business casual wardrobe, too. I now have high quality clothes that cost me pennies compared to their market price. I also love that I get all the satisfaction of retail therapy without pumping additional money into the fashion industry. It’s a big win all the way around!",5
1284,"I buy everything on thredUP: I’m a stylish mom of 2 girls, and a thredUP shopper for all of us. I bundle my orders to save on shipping, take advantage of big sales, keep an ongoing list of favorites and LOVE my purchases. 
I recommend thredUP to all my friends and family.
Pay close attention to sizing on descriptions, remember these are USED items, they’ve stretched or been washed since their original retail purchase. I stick to dresses, tops, jackets and shoes, I still prefer purchasing pants and shorts in person. Go start hearting!",5
1285,"Great app! What happened to pricing?: I’ve been a ThredUp fan for several years. The app is great but it took a bit of time to figure out how to turn off notifications. My only complaint... the wild pricing increases lately. And worse, finding the eat at same item in the same condition with two completely different price ranges. Folk, it’s used!  10% & 20% off retail is NOT acceptable for USED. Some people realize this, others do not.  It just means I have to wade through more items to find the best price.",5
1286,"Seller Beware!: I sent in a box (my 30th box or so) and I paid to have the unwanted items sent back to me via ""return assurance"". Several of the items were returned back to me 6 months later damaged and the box was filled with debris and dirt. I contacted support and provided pictures and Erynn said that there is nothing that could be done and even blamed the problem on me. I am very disappointed to say the least because up until now I was really happy with thred up. I believe that in the 6 months that my items were in their possession they were thrown around and rushed through due to them being understaffed and overwhelmed with inventory. I'm still in shock with how they handled my issue. SELLER BEWARE!",1
1287,If I could give more stars I would!: I absolutely love Thredup!  I just got an order and it is better than I thought it was going to be the shirts were folded perfectly and wrapped beautifully with tissue!  I felt so special from packing !  The quality of the clothing was amazing and the price was so affordable!  The fact that I can shop and feel so happy is nothing to the fact it helps the environment.  Don’t be afraid to place an order with this store there are only positive things to say! Thank you for saving the planet!,5
1288,"Easiest way to consign from home!: Whether you just have some clothes laying around that you know you’ll never wear again, or if you’re a reseller and have some stale inventory laying around, thredUP is the perfect way to make a little extra money. I have sent in four bags now, and have been very pleased with my profit. Additionally, I love their rescue boxes!! They have always been great about including a couple of AWESOME brands, and the rest are always good brands. I love thredUP and will continue to use lots of the many services that they offer!",5
1289,Love them!! but hate the shipping with FedEx.: I’ve been using ThredUP for almost 3 years now and I absolutely love it! Only thing I don’t like is that they use FedEx for all shipping and they are so extremely slow. I’ve had packages from them get lost before and it usually takes a week + to receive your package normally. Other than the shipping I really love thredUP and buy almost all mine and my children’s clothes through them. Makes back to school shopping for high end brands cheap and you can save so much money!,5
1290,"Variety, but bad return policy: I really want to love ThredUp but I can’t get over the return policy. I understand that it costs $ to process and return items, I do, but fearing something may not fit and having to pay $2.50 per item to return is really off putting. Instead, I pay $20 or so to tailor each item, which slowly erases the cost savings (and my love of the app). I lean towards clothing lines I know well, to get a good fit, but it’s still sometimes way off. 

I would also bit more if I could search better. The item descriptions are so vague that I can’t find things - why can’t I search for something like “tank dress”??",3
1291,"Nifty app!: I really enjoyed using the thred up app!  I like the numerous categories.  It was very clear and easy to use and shop.  My only issue was that if I set filters to size and what-not and then decide to narrow down the categories section as well, (say from all to just tops) then it would take away my previous filters...slightly annoying if you are just shopping along and then realize you have some wrong sized items in your cart.  Though that was my only issue and why I gave 4 of 5 stars.",5
1292,"Filters aren’t great but the company is: I’ve used ThredUP a few times now and been VERY happy with the clothing I’ve bought. My biggest complaint is that the search filters aren’t great. In women’s dresses, for example, you can’t search by sleeve length, and even when you can filter out results, the clothing doesn’t always fit the category it says it does. It’d be a lot easier to find what you’re looking for if only solid black dresses come up when you search for a solid black dress, instead of the stripes, polka dots, and gingham I’ve been seeing. That being said, I’ll definitely continue to use the app to buy clothing!",3
1293,"addicted: when i first heard about thredup i had no idea i was even remotely interested in clothes but these days i find myself browsing new arrivals PURELY for fun, collecting favorite brands and silhouettes and fabrics and colors along the way, endlessly amused at the prospect of thrifting an outfit i never would have expected i would end up wearing, much less loving. the app functions pretty intuitively too, it really is this easy to switch to secondhand. do the world and yourself a favor by trying it out.",5
1294,"Love the concept: I think this is a brilliant idea. Normally I would just donate my cloths.   But the idea that someone else is going to be able to afford something that would not normally be able to and I get a couple extra $$ in my pocket.  Love it.  Plus you can pick and choose which items that you will put on consignment and which you just want to cash out on. Awesome.  The only thing missing for me is knowing which items I sent did not make the cut.  Also it took 2 weeks longer to process then they estimated.
I highly recommend this site!",4
1295,Fine for buying NOT for selling: I echo the reviews others have left that ThredUP is great for buying and horrible for selling. Three stars is generous and mostly because the app is very easy to use. Payouts for high end merchandise is very low and I feel a person would be better off selling on their own using the plethora of apps/marketplaces that are out there now or just donating. I have had an ok experience purchasing from ThredUP. I have received items that have not been as described or have been misrepresented on the site (like quality issues) and have had no problem returning or dealing with customer service in this case.,3
1296,"Fashion w/ Choices: People notice my threads! For 3 winters, my amazing fire+ice orange winter coat find hasn't ceased to get comments! :) Many other selections have given me that happy boost to don, even if just for myself ;) Plus, attempting to wear amazing clothes  is, well, amazing…….. And I can return whatever this ever changing body yearns for, yet cannot justifiable wear in public.  Thus, I faithfully return what is hideous and comfortably do it from my home and then wear my finds in public  and remark to others remarks, “I got it from ThredUp!”",5
1297,"Don’t shop here!: I bought a $90 wool Ralph Lauren dress that was advertised as “brand new with tags still attached” . The dress came with a Thread up tag only, looking well worn and small holes on front and back. I tried to return the dress through app but it was marked as “non-returnable” and that would not work. Tried to contact support through chat- it took me in circles and circles with noone actually to chat with. Emailed them twice to their listed customer email,  attaching photos of the dress, and never heard back. There is no phone number listed . It’s an awful business which I will recommend everyone to avoid. I will write a one star review for them every day until I hear from someone, maybe.",1

1299,"Sizing: Women’s sizing is rough from the start, but I have to believe some of the measurements posted are not correct, and therefore not helpful! Sometimes a size large chest is measured at 20” or something similar. That can’t be right. I’m not sure the solution, besides maybe looking up info or getting info from the designer, but it might be more helpful. 

Also I wish there were an option to bundle so many dresses and if choosing to keep “f” amount you can return the rest without the restocking fee. Because women’s sizing is asinine and arbitrary.",4
1300,"Simply amazing: First let me say… I’m in my thirties and this is my first review ever! I love ThredUP that much! I love everything about it. The sustainability aspect is incredible, and the prices are amazing. I don’t have a lot of money. Any extra I do have, I spend on my son doing fun things. I feel guilty splurging on myself. When I came across thredUP, I wanted to cry. I am finally able to reward myself with amazing styles and brands, for super cheap!!! I applaud them, and thank them, for providing such a unique business.",5
1301,"Will never shop here again: I bought a $10 BOX a MONTH ago, got it, loved everything so I kept the 10 items.  And then today my card declines when I went to pay a bill.  Go to check my bank account and I was charged $268 for a $10 box!!! Not once did the description say I would have to pay for anything I decided to keep.  It said the $10 was to cover that! Now I’m in a bind and can’t pay the rest of my bills until I get paid again 2 WEEKS from now!!  I’ve been in contact with my bank and I’ve emailed through customer service.   I better get my money back because that is NOT what I signed up for!  Was the first and last time I ever order from y’all!",1
1302,"Good but could be better: I’ve been using ThredUP for a little while and I enjoy the variety of designers and styles but it would be nice if there were sales or promotions a little more often, as someone who loves a good bargain there are many great finds but some of the items are really overpriced for second hand. 
I do enjoy the simplicity of the returns, however it would be nice if the process could be a bit faster as sometimes it can take over a week to be processed. 
All in all ThredUP is a good place to shop.",4
1303,"Has been processing my clean out bag for MONTHS: I don’t understand the positive reviews. I sent clothes in June and the status still says “processing”. I was notified there would be a longer processing time, but I am well past the extended time frame and I have no way to get an update. The customer service chat won’t acknowledge my questions because I have t placed an order, I cannot find a customer service email, phone number etc. They have been holding my clothes for 4 months, I could have sold or donated them another way. The convenience is not worth having your clothes basically hostage for months and no custom service options if you aren’t buying clothes from them.",1
1304,"THRIFT!!: Guys, this is a game-changer. ThredUp has become my designated shopping place when I want to change up my wardrobe or need a piece for a specific occasion. They have amazing sales going on pretty much always. When you buy, you get points to redeem on future orders. Everything I have ordered has been in perfect condition. Their return policy is great. They have very affordable prices and even luxury/name brands at a very good price. Really, there is NOTHING negative about what ThredUp stands for and is.",5
1305,"Overall great experience: I love the app and the ease with which I can shop my favorite brands and save searches. I’ve gotten some really cute stuff for an amazing price! I did purchase a dress, however, that was listed as in excellent condition and the hem was completely let out. My only major complaint is the time it takes for returns to be processed and my account credited. It’s not worth it with some purchases to deal with shipping and restocking fees so store credit is the best option in my opinion but it can be a lengthy process.",4
1306,"Love it!: I discovered Thred-Up about 3 months ago and have found soooo many gems!  Everything I’ve purchased has been exactly as described. I recently requested a kit to sell clothes so I’m anxious to see how that goes!  

The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the shipping time is very inconsistent. Sometimes I have my items in a few days and sometimes it takes 10 days or more. I wish there was a way to choose your shipping option to guarantee when you’ll receive your items.",4
1307,"Packaging and refine search: Thredup is so easy to shop, love the clothes selection. The only thing I have a problem with is that for 9 clothing items, I’m getting three packages. 7 items in one, 1 item in second, and 1 item in third. Why can’t you guys at least combine the two individual items together? Second thing, I would love to shop for some pants, but it’s hard to go through 23,000 pairs. It might be a bug, because when I choose to look only at straight or skinny pants, I still get flared or super wide pants in my search. Please fix!! I love you guys!",4
1308,"Packaging: ThredUP is fashionably amazing!  The only snag I ran across is that one of the packages arrived empty! 😱There was supposed to be a great find (Ann Taylor pants I found for 5.99) in the package.  Although I was sad not to receive my find, I contacted customer service through the app and was immediately given a refund.  The rest of the packages were loaded with my amazing fashion finds in great condition just as expected.  The thredUP concept is probably one of the best inventions yet!  I really enjoy looking through the app and finding Prada, jimmy choos, and other amazing brands.  I wish there was a section for men and young teenage men too!",4
1309,Missing measurements on clothing: I have been a customer for a long time and love browsing the site for clothing I might purchase. I have also sent several cleanout bags to ThredUP. But now I hesitate to purchase certain items without the measurements that used to be added in the description of the clothes. I need chest measurements and length measurements to even consider purchasing an item. I especially prefer the length listed for skirts because it’s not easy to tell by looking at the pictures. Please bring back the measurements so I don’t have to guess by looking at the pictures then return the item because it doesn’t fit.,3
1310,"SLOW Shipping: ThredUP needs to up it’s game. I purchase a lot online, through retailers and other reselling platforms. In fact I placed an order on The Real Real around the same time as my recent thredUP order. My beautiful shoes from RealReal have arrived and have been worn already and I’m still waiting for my thredUP order to arrive. I think it’s a great concept, I think their prices are good and I want to purchase through this app. But people are now used to receiving things within a few days and going on 8 days (and tracking says my items still have a few days till arrival) is not going to make me a return customer.",3
1311,"Ok, but not impressed.: I was so excited to get my first order... especially after seeing some of my favorite instagrammers carrying on about the quality. Imagine my surprise when I opened my box full of “like new items” (per item description) and found marks and scuffing to the corners of the handbag (of course a final sell item) or worn looking shorts... or a shirt definitely not in “like new” quality. You would definitely do better going to a local consignment or resale shop where you can actual see the condition. Suggestion to ThredUp - you might want to really work on your descriptions so they better fit the items.",3
1312,"New version lacks important features: A thing I like about this app is the robust search and filters. Seriously better than a lot of higher-end retail sites. But:
1. the new update lacks the # of returned results after adding a filter - so how do I know if I need to keep filtering or I’m able to stop and look at 20 or 200 results instead of 2,000? And
2. Please bring back the sleeve filter for tops and dresses - I want to know if I am looking for short sleeve or sleeveless or bracelet or 3/4 or cut outs or one-shoulder… among many examples. 
Filters were a strength for this app, please bring them back",3
1313,"A Treasure Trove: I’ve been shopping on ThredUp for years! As a single parent teacher with expensive taste but not the budget, ThredUp has enabled my daughter and I to be stylish within our price constraints. We love it! It’s a bonafide addiction! Search for the brand, filter the condition, and there are a ton of options at reasonable prices. Wardrobe refreshes are fun and financially doable. And you are doing something good for the world when you recycle clothing. It’s a win win all around, I barely shop anywhere else!",5
1314,"Buy used!: A friend recommended that I try Thredup because I’m thrifty and hate waste. I am absolutely hooked. I make purchases just about every month and send back what doesn’t fit or I don’t like. They make the process so easy! The quality of the clothing is excellent—some even have tags still attached! My only complaint is that the measurements given are not always accurate. So thats disappointing at times. But otherwise I highly recommend Thredup to anyone who likes good quality, thrifted clothes!",4
1315,"A diamond in the rough: This business is genius. I wish they were located near me so I could work for them. The app is smooth and straight forward. On the rare occasion I return something, as soon as the post office scans it in, I get my credit to use for another purchase. Plus, I send them my clothes and receive a credit towards my future purchases when something sells. This is primarily where I get my clothes now.  Saving me money and recycling!! Beautiful",5
1316,"Lost items: At me to the list of list clean out bags.  My clean out bag was posted and after 6 months of watching the processing date get pushed back, it disappeared.  They do not contact you about your missing clean out bag. You have to contact them.  I guess they’re hoping you don’t notice.  After 3 emails I finally got a response.  They offered me $42 for my 30lb box with designer items.  When I started selling and buying on this app it was fabulous.  Losing/ stealing items is completely unacceptable and customer service is practically nonexistent plus the little you do receive after many emails is not apologetic in the least.  Too many other apps to deal with company.",1
1317,"Sellers, Too Long too Process Bags: I have used Thred Up in the past to sell items and it was an okay experience. However, this last year they have severely gone downhill. I sent in a clean out bag in May 2022 and they acknowledged receipt of it the first week of June 2022. Here we are almost in November and it still has not been processed. That is unacceptable. If they are really that busy, they should hire more people or send the clothing bags back at no expense to the seller. My clothing that was for summer and early fall or now no good if they try to sell them during the wintertime. It’s a shame, because this could have been a great way to sell your clothes.",2
1318,"Overall great!: Love the quality items, good pricing for them, and green pok a dot shipping boxes and bags  they come in. They could do a little better on the pictures but most of the time it’s ok. Would like to see the heels in the back on shoes for wear, and anything that is white gets lost in their white background ( they need a darker  background to see the lighter items. 

I’ll keep shopping here because it’s great and I’m sure improvements will come along at some point.",5
1319,"Disappointed ☹️ Robbed of my points ☹️: I’m really disappointed!! I had over 7,000 points because I ordered A LOT of clothes & shoes this time last year so I’ve been waiting to use the discounts I accrued. Sadly, I was beyond disappointed to find that on January 10, 2022 they did a “points conversion.” I went from 7,031 points to 0 (zero) points & then a final “point conversion” the same day left me with 1 (one) point!!! How do you get ONE POINT from 7,031 (SEVEN THOUSAND+)??? 🤯😩😩😡
It doesn’t say they expired and if they did that too is ridiculous!! I’m SOOO DISAPPOINTED!! I’m going to take my annual $800-$1,000 clothing shopping spree to a different second-hand store. BEYOND DISAPPOINTED- I feel like I got duped! Why would you do this to a good customer?! ☹️",1
1320,"Loosing 30 lbs and getting a new wardrobe: I love ThredUp!! Shopping from home, liking, going back and forth, thinking it through, finding all my favorite brands, shopping outlets from home. Amazing! Great quality clothing!!! to orices that cannot be beat.

Only one suggestion - I’m relying on measurements for fitting, even waist measurements for skirts, and bust measurements for jackets - which is currently not provided. So, pls add additional measurements - no one wants to return clothing.

Thank you for a great app and shopping experience!!",5
1321,"Just okay: I ordered from ThreadUp for the first time about a month ago.  Three “like new” tops, one “new with tags” and two pairs of shoes.  The shoes are great and for the most part so are the tops with a couple of exceptions….after washing according to washing instructions, my “new with tags” top is unraveling in several places and not able to be repaired.  A second “ like new” top has the elastic at the bottom coiled around itself so it no longer fits well.  Not sure if ThreadUp is worth it.",5
1322,"Obsessed!: I have been shopping with ThredUp for several years, and I can honestly say that I prefer their app to their website. It’s so easy to use, the listings translate perfectly to mobile, and the purchasing process is oh so smooth. If you love to shop — even just window shop — you’ll find yourself scrolling through the app on the daily. There is so much inventory, even in specialty (petite, plus) sizing. PLUS it’s sustainable. Win, win, win! Highly recommend!",5
1323,"Everything about this shop 😍: I started using thredUP about 2 years ago, and it was so easy to sell my clothes. I just recently downloaded this app and started buying clothes and I AM SO IN LOVE!!! The clothes are better quality than I thought, the app makes everything a breeze, and shipping was so quick-even with the unfortunate state of our world at the moment. I am very pleased with this shop and their app. I love recycling and thrifting, and this shop is a good-doer🤍🤍",5
1324,"Nope: Don’t do it. Don’t use this app to sell clothing. I can’t speak for buying clothing but selling is a HARD no. After FOUR months I finally found out what they bought from my bag that I sent in. They bought 5 tops & a cardigan from me for $1.68. Yes, you read that right. One dollar & sixty-eight cents. This has been a horrendously long process just to get $1.68. Totally a complete waste of time. I wish I kept my clothes to sell on Poshmark. And yeah it would’ve taken more effort to sell on Poshmark but at least I would’ve gotten what my clothes were worth. Now I’d have to pay $15 just to get my clothes sent back to me which would probably take an additional four months. Don’t let these positive reviews fool you. This is not the way to sell clothes.",1
1325,"Wonderful invention: I am a big fan of Thred Up since I aim to shop mostly second hand and Thred Up have revolutionized the process by offering second hand item online while also providing a good app experience. I also really appreciate the reusable/recyclable packaging. 

The only reason I am docking a star is because the shipping seems to take a long time. Compared to other companies I have the option to receive packages inside 1-3 days while Thred Up often takes over 1 week. It would be great if didn’t shipping options were offered.",4
1326,"Fail: Where do I start. 
1.  Their ‘requirements’ for sending things in don’t match up with what you see listed. They want sheer perfection for what you send, but the majority of what’s listed is far from that. 
2.  The photos are atrocious. Items are barely visible, and if it’s a dark color, forget it.  This is why I wouldn’t shop here. If I can’t see it, I’m not buying it. 
3.  The selling model is great—for them—not for you. You make a couple pennies on very nice items.  And if you’re a buyer, you’re over paying for items.  I’D RATHER DONATE TO CHARITY than have them rake in the $ for themselves on my stuff. They have a ton of advertising which must be a huge part of their budget. I don’t feel they are helping their so-called ‘cause’ because they’re reaping so much money. 
4.  The website is difficult to navigate. Finding customer service is a job, which seems to say that they don’t want to help you.  However, if you’re buying, then they’re your best friend. 

This could be a great platform but the way it is now just reeks greed with a mask that tells you it’s such a great thing.",1
1327,"Links don’t work, mobile app with broken links: Once you have made a purchase, on the mobile app the curated items that go with your purchase (which are helpful) the links don’t take you to anything. I really love the concept of this store/app but the tie off between app and desktop application really needs a lot more attention because the 2 applications don’t integrate well. Feels like it’s a second or last thought verses priority. Instead of TV commercials, spend it on better dev ops.",5
1328,"Very disappointing.: Honestly, don’t waste your time or effort with this company. I used it 4c so far, and they really hook you with the first clean out bag. I sent in about 10-15 items of regular department store items, and got a whopping $90. The second, third and fourth time I sent bags in, I didn’t make $90 collectively. When reaching out to customer service to inquire about the poor pay outs, they gave me a rant about how they have to make money and the is a price estimator on their website. That’s great, but not “the most convenient” as they told me their company was. Save your time and effort, use Poshmark. I’ve had great success with that company and they are just as easy, and actually allow you to make something on their purchases.",1
1329,Happy customer: I have never sold through ThredUP so I can’t review that portion of the process but I have purchased many items through them and I am extremely happy.  Items are advertised correctly as stated.  Many times I have received are brand new still with tags. I have gotten many great bargains and have saved hundreds by shopping with ThredUP!  I hardly ever purchase clothing anywhere else anymore! I cancelled my Dia & Co subscription because I can find comparable items on ThredUP for half (or more) the cost!,5
1330,"Love thredUP - want better search/filters: Oh wow! Do I love scrolling through thredUP and what this app has to offer?? YES!!! It’s fabulous!!  Great clothes at great prices!  As far as the app goes, I only wish search function was better.... I can’t search by sleeve length on dresses (and typing “long sleeved dress” in the search bar doesn’t help either) wish I could! It would just be nice to refine results better since there are THOUSANDS upon THOUSANDS of items available!!!! Still gave it 5 stars because of the joy it has brought into my life, but if search function improved, I’d love it more!",4
1331,LOVE ThredUP!: I have really improved my wardrobe in the 2 1/2 years I’ve been using this app. I have not been happy with a few things but this is thrift shopping. Mainly disappointing fit and occasionally not the quality I am looking for. It makes me far more cautious in selecting and always when shopping second hand err on the side of ordering larger than taking a chance on smaller. For example I wear a 10/12 and do better if I stick to 12 or size large on ThredUP as I’d rather it be a bit large than too small as too small makes things look cheap.,4
1332,"Great when the app works!: I think Thred Up is a great service and I love using the app when it works. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work very frequently. Most of the time it will show that I am logged in, but it won’t allow me access (to like, cart, or buy anything) and it will ask me to sign in. When I try signing in it will say access denied. I don’t have this problem when I shop in browser (so I know I’m using the correct credentials).",5
1333,"Denise: I have received beautiful clothes, I’m so pleased.  One out of the 6 or so boxes wasn’t packed nicely (clothes thrown in) which disappointed me as the ones I received that were packed with care showed appreciation for customer and clothes and matters to me.  I am a bit confused on sharing my purchases to receive further discounts, but I’m still learning.  I can not reiterate enough how pleased I am with the quality of the clothes I received.  Different designers different sizing so I’ll have to return some things, I can’t comment on how that process will go, but I’m hoping well.  GREAT PRICES!!!",4
1334,"Don’t download if you don’t have an account already: I just downloaded this app out of curiosity. It was SO much work trying to make an account with them that it’s not even worth it. I’ll even admit I tried a little harder than I normally would (like going to their website 5x) because the sign up process was SO frustrating. 

First of all, the sign-up through Facebook doesn’t work. You will just get the spinning wheel of death. Every. Single. Time. 

Then, if you try to create an account through the app it will tell you your password is wrong. I tried this through both sign-up and log in. Believe me when I say I understand what form I was using. You cannot create an account through the app.

My curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to give it a final try through their site. Nope. Their site redirects you to open the app. I tried to visit their site more times than I am proud of. I finally found a work around and clicked on an ad of theirs, tried to sign up on the mobile site and the form told me to “confirm you are a valid visitor.”

I’m over it. Fix the user experience.",1
1335,"Very disappointing for seller: I have used similar services but my sister recommended giving this one a try. I thought “how easy” this would be since they do the work for you. Well, everything I sent was in excellent condition. Most not worn at all. Even a Gucci purse and wallet. Wallet was still in box with tag. That never made the listed items. Clothes and shoes were priced EXTREMELY low. Payout was ridiculous. Then when I tried to reach the company with questions everything is automated. Even the questions they lay you ask are from a computer pre generated choice. This is very misleading. Not helpful for the seller at all. I do not recommend this sight and will never use it again.",1
1336,"Such an Ethical and beautiful site to shop luxury!: This year I made a pact with myself that I will buy less new clothing and buy second hand! I feel as if most people have the misconception that thrifted clothing is “worn out” but could not be less true! They really check for quality and it says on the site the condition it is in. I found a pair of Anne Klein shoes that were originally sold for 200+ for TWENTY dollars! Can’t even tell they are worn in, if anything they are so comfortable!",5
1337,"PAID FOR MISSING ITEMS: Thredup sent me an email for an item they failed to include in my order today, while the order was over 6 months ago. They charged me for this item and never refunded the $26. That’s right, they mailed an order without this item and charged me for it. They stated they refunded it, but check your bank statements, they do not refund anything. When I contacted customer service, the man was rude, unhelpful, and condescending. How dare I assume a company as big as ThredUP would not make a simple refund? Did I think I was special or something?

Here we are over 6 months later and I still have no refund. BUT, I received an email from them today letting me know for an order I placed in January, that the item was unavailable. 

Guess what? 

I still have no refund.

Original review left over 6 months ago: 
I have reached out twice regarding a refund I was supposed to receive as they left an item out of my order. It has been two weeks and no refund and no word from ThredUP. It’s great as long as you don’t have an issue.",1
1338,"Good overall: Solid app over all. My only complaint is with ThredUP itself. With shoes, they only allow you to set your sizes in US sizing. However, they bring up shoes with incorrect European sizes, like their size conversion is incorrect in the filtering process. I have emailed them about this issue but it has still not been resolved. For example: I wear a US Women’s size 9.5-10 shoe. By most shoe conversion graphs with a quick google search, this should be EU Size 41-42, but ThredUP displays EU size 40 with their filter. If this was corrected I would give 5 stars.",4
1339,"Thread up messed up my order: Hello there and thank you so much for mixing up my order and then changing my order on my order form, which I do not appreciate at all.!! I’ve tried to contact y’all about it and I haven’t heard anything back from y’all yet.!! The way I see it is that it is soo much y’all’s fault and that y’all should send me the right shirt I ordered.!! But instead it was a favorite one I was gonna get later on and now I’m not able to get the one that I ordered.!! Shame on you ThredUP for sending and changing my order form which I did not do.!! Very very unhappy with y’all and here it is y’all know what y’all did and can’t even get back to me..!! Zero stars 0 for y’all thanks a lot",1
1340,"Love ThredUp!: I’ve been a ThredUp customer since about 2014. LOVE thrifting and the idea of recycled clothing but hate spending the time combing racks of clothing and only finding 1 or 2 items. ThredUp makes the thrift process so much easier. I actually prefer shopping via the app VS on the actual website. I’ve loved almost everything I’ve purchased. And if I didn’t love it, the return/refund process has been quick. Any issues or quality discrepancies have been handled appropriately and promptly by customer service.",5
1341,"App will not open anymore: I really like ThredUP and I think the app is set up very well generally speaking...Problem is, for the past 5 or 6 months, every time I try to open the app, the little circle just spins on the “thredUP” logo page and never actually opens. I have tried deleting and re-uploading the app numerous times, it does not work. It is not a connectively issue. And even if it was a connectivity issue, the little circle spins endlessly, I never receive a “no connection, please try later” message or anything of the sort. I really don’t want to give a 2 star rating but this is an ongoing issue has makes using the thredUP service less convenient, fun, and engaging.",2
1342,"Great selection, good customer service: Have been shopping on here for a while now. They have a great selection of clothing and make it really easy to search by brand, color, style, etc. I also like using my “favorites” section as a fashion mood board of sorts. I have only had to contact customer service once, and my question was answered within a day and resolved quickly. I have no issues with the app design, and love getting good deals on the clothes I buy. Would highly recommend!",5
1343,"Cleaned out my closet: So I did their thing called clean out my closet, they sent me a bag with a return label. I feel the bag with hundreds of dollars in clothes most knew some gently used. All top brand companies. It took a week or two to process. I was never notified when the order was processed my login online I was extremely disappointed in the fact that I only got a couple cents per item totaling maybe $15 dollars. They sell each item for 10x the account they gave me. They kept all of my items. And I mad nothing. Besides $1.90 something. $0.04 on something else.  Are you freaking kidding me. I emailed them immediately and never heard back! I DO NOT recommend you selling them your clothes, especially not brand new clothes or top brands.",1
1344,"THREDUP FOREVER: Love love (did I say love?) LOVE THREDUP! Not only is it good for the planet to reuse clothing, but you truly get one of a kind pieces and the hunt for them is SO fun! I’ve gotten some of my favorite NAME BRAND workout clothing for a 1/4 of the price! Also, for a mom of two toddlers, it saves me from having to endure the madness of clothing shopping with my littles. 😅 oh and my kids, they also have mostly ThredUp clothing. Some of their best outfits are from ThredUp! My only criticism, open a men’s section so I can buy for my Husband too! He’s starting to get jealous of all my thrifty steals. ;-)",5
1345,"Great secondhand app!: Really enjoying this app as a buyer! Sales happen frequently & promo codes are given to buyers, which I really appreciate. Only piece of feedback I would give is that more information on specific articles of clothing would be helpful for the purchaser - like specific cut, make of the item, and/or measurements. Returns take a little while to process, but overall I’ve been pleased that it is an option & that the credit goes back into my account for future purchases!",5
1346,"Best Shopping Experience Ever: I am not a shopper. I have come to love and depend on getting excellent bargains from Thread Up. The way they display and describe the items make it easy to pick out what you are looking for. In case the fit isn’t right or the color isn’t what you thought, their return policy makes it easy to return things and get a credit or reimbursed. The filters make sure you don’t waste time going through countless items you aren’t interested in. Easiest shopping anywhere.",5
1347,Love the idea... but that is all: So I want to start by saying I have had excellent experiences buying in the past from this company. But they have gotten ridiculously expensive and slow! Some of the things on their site that are used I have seen in store for cheaper! The pictures the show do not always do the item justice either... several items are nothing like how they were described. I wish they could step up their game a little because this is an amazing idea but with their costs what they are I can save a lot of money just shopping clearance racks and at least with that I know it’s brand new and I have the option of a decent return service...,2
1348,"Pay out is too little: I sent some clothes that were sitting out in my garage for a while to get rid of them really quick and make room for new stuff. I already knew the pay out was really little compared to how much they are making on my donations but it is really little. 

In addition to that customers have to wait longer to get paid because they hold the funds for 2 weeks and the only pay out options are ordering a visa prepaid card every time, transferring via PayPal by paying 2% fee, or getting credit towards purchase on the website. 

Here’s my advice to you. Figure out a way to pay the customers quicker and more for their stuff. No wonder this platform has such a bad reputation.",1
1349,"Not worth it: I sent in a bag full of name brand, barely used clothes and was sure I’d make a nice little profit, minimum. Only a handful of items were chosen, and I cannot figure out why certain pieces weren’t. I had a BCBG blouse that I paid over $100 for, I searched all over the internet for it after a soap star was wearing it. I also had some Lucky Brand leopard flats that had only been worn a couple of times. Neither of these items made the cut and I’m very curious as to why. It really makes no sense. Anyway, of the couple of items that sold, I made such a little amount it was hardly worth the effort of cashing the check. Will NOT use them again, would rather donate to charity and know that some deserving people ended up with my nicer things.",1
1350,"Love it until recently!: Love love love this app - the only thing I will say is that recently when you go into your favorites and select an item when you go back to the list, it always brings you back to the top regardless of where you were in the list. 

I have the utmost confidence that this will be fixed as soon as a developer sees this review and once that is fixed this app will return to being one of my favorites:)",5
1351,"ThreadUp has changed my way of shopping!: I was never interested thrift clothing until I stumbled upon ThreadUp. I love shopping here! Their items are clearly and professionally pictured so you know exactly what you're getting. All of the items I've purchased have been in excellent shape. I never would have known they were once someone else's. The only reason I put 4 stars is because they don't provide measurements for jackets. All other items do though, so you can be confident that it will fit. 💖",4
1352,"Shop here FIRST: I was lucky enough to have lost enough weight that not many of my long grown wardrobe staples no longer fit.  I started looking on Thred Up and found beautiful quality wool skirts.  I kept adding to my cart and was surprised when I ended up with 7 skirts. To my amazement with a discount the total was $50 for Ann Taylor Loft, Talbots, White House Black Market and Lularoe.  I will start looking here first before pricey online boutiques and trendy brick and mortar mall stores. So glad I found Thred Up.",5
1353,The highest amount of screen time on my phone: I love this app! I love thrift shopping in person and it’s rare dressing rooms are open in them so why thrift from home. If you want less fails when you order remember you body measurements and they have the exact size of all items! I am too lazy for that and lowkey I love the gamble. The success rate of item is like 2 out of 20. Love the millions of filters to search for exactly what you need! WHOEVER CREATED THIS APP THANK YOU❤️. It’s a thrifters paradise,5
1354,"Restocking fee to much: I was alright with the increase in prices, however with the frequent description errors and the photos not matching the item received, it may be better to buy new. The retailers have a lot of merchandise right now. If you are not buying high end quality items, the app is no longer worth it.  I’m a VIP member, you would think I would get some type of incentive. I know the cost has went up but really😩😫😖",5
1355,"Used to rock, now a Scam: Over the years of threadup existing their prices have steadily climbed. The return policy is really telling: they will keep a portion of each sale and you have to pay shipping. So if the clothes don’t fit, you just paid $10 to try something on. Whens the last time a thrift store or any store charged for trying on clothes? Yeah never.
I’ve also gotten clothes from them that reek of perfume to the point its unwashable. I’ve gotten things where the inseam measurement was a lie online and the pants have in fact been hemmed roughly to capri length. And their descriptions of fabric and material of shoes and bags is vague and often blatant lies.
0/10 do not recommend. Bring back clothing swaps",1
1356,Big family on a budget: We are a big family and to have a place to shop where we don’t have to spend an arm and a leg and still get good quality clothing for our children is a must and I get to do it at home and not have to search and search through bins or isles. it’s really nice way to shop if you’re on a budget even if you’re not you can find some things for a good price even brand names try it out!,5
1357,"Must improve filters: Thredup is great and you’ve really improved shipping and returns, thank you! Please focus on your filter options. Adding the ability to filter by Women’s Chest size for dresses and tops like you can for waist size on pants would make a huge difference in customer experience and ability to purchase more! There are so many options and having a way for consumers to narrow it down to realistic purchases would really help and we wouldn’t leave the app before getting frustrated.",4
1358,"Easy way to shop ethical!: ThredUP has a huge selection, which is great because I can almost always find many more styles than I’d find in any given store (and I hate going from store to store to store looking for what I want!). The downside is that it can take some patience to look though everything, but it means I can shop with a clean conscience (second hand is better for the environment and workers!), so it’s def worth it. The app is easy to use!",5
1359,"Very disappointed: Most of the items are so outdated that the sizes are too small, fabric is worn or stained, or otherwise in poor shape. The pictures are very misleading. Out of $400 in orders, I’m only keeping 5 things. It’s a hassle to pack everything up and drop off at a shopping store, just for a few bucks in returns.  So I’ve donated the rest, over $350 of my orders. The only good thing I have to say about ThredUP is that my packages arrived very quickly.  I’m deleting this app and won’t be ordering anymore.  I’ll stick with my 80% off department store for new clothes that I trust will fit, be of more recent styles and quality, and be of value.",2
1360,"Everything but the smell: I have found some great items, & they are always as described, I have been buying the majority of my clothes in thrift stores for years. Sometimes they have a thrift store smell, but one washing gets rid of it. Everything I buy from you has instead a department store smell so strong I wonder if you are spraying something straight onto the clothes. This smell is really strong & takes several washings & days in the sun to get rid of it.",5
1361,"Difficult to search for specific brands: Compared to similar sites, I have found it difficult to search/shop for a specific brand or item. For example Express jeans barely boot stretch. The search will return 0 results but after scrolling through all the women’s jeans, I will find that same jean that didn’t come up in my search. I believe it costs the company a lot of business because I believe you likely have something I am looking for but can’t find it in your search engine. I will go to similar sites and find what I am looking for immediately and purchase through competitor based on ease",2
1362,"Love thredUP: Love the app, easy to navigate (dear Wish app, please take notes), I love that you can easily search by a category and not just have to randomly guess that when you search “top for under ten dollars” that that’s what will show up, the way the “favorited items” feature works is great, I love that it saves specific searches if you want it to, and I haven’t gotten a parcel yet but it’s already shipped.  Plus I got a super-sweet email from the cofounder. So far, impressed",5
1363,"Thred Up fills the void when I can’t thrift: I’m missing thrift store shopping in the era of Covid so much but browsing Thred Up is my new norm. I’ve found several of my favorite items on this app. I love the clean, uniform aesthetic and how my sizes are saved and filtered automatically. Other apps take note! My only critique is you basically have to take the gamble on size and fit because returns are a headache. Between the shipping and restocking cost, it’s sometimes cost prohibitive to return something. I wish it came with a return envelop. Maybe that envelop could double as a Clean Out bag?",4
1364,Frustrating: I made all the items  I liked my favorites took me several days to pick out the items I wanted...I am in the middle of my purchase and chose PayPal to pay...it kept going in a circle I stopped the transaction..only to find 3 items out of my cart missing an not in my Favorites either...I got no notification my cart or items were about to expire... I have lost at least 7 items I wanted to buy an cant find them again...not going to use this app again to frustrating...I had an item expire at 1:20 am an I lost that item too..who the hell is up then looking at thred up...you lost a customer my first order was 10 items...this one would have been 6 items ...never happened,1
1365,"So easy, LOVE them! Returns are easy: I really love these guys. My items are always great, in good condition and don’t stink. I get compliments all the time on my clothes and I love telling people about ThredUp! I have done a return on shoes that didn’t fit. The returns are so simple and easy, you just go to the app and click the button that says “return” next to the item/s you bought. There’s no need to call or email anyone.... they also don’t make you jump through hoops to prove why you need to return the items....",5
1366,"Quality and Value: I am very much about reuse, repurpose, recycle and have been a thrift shopper for years, accordingly. However! I am a relatively discriminate shopper and expect a certain level of quality in the products I purchase.  In addition, I expect great customer service.  I have not been disappointed in any experience with ThredUp to date - the products are as good or better than expected and service has been exceptional. I would recommend ThredUp to anyone.",5
1367,"Amazing !: I’ve always had trouble buying clothes at stores because honestly, I always felt uncomfortable and insecure about something not fitting correctly. Thank you THREDUP for existing! Everything I’ve bought so far has fit like a glove and all the items have been beautiful. I have completely stopped shopping in stores and have moved on to this site. There are SO many plus size items to choose from, prices are great too! Shoes are especially wonderful and have large varieties.",5
1368,"So happy I discovered this option!: I tried Stitch Fix first. I don’t enjoy shopping and the thought of someone else noting what I like and my size, then sending me clothes sounded too good to be true; it was. Tried them 3 times and kept 1 item. 
Thred Up is perfect! I can shop whenever I like and know I’ll be receiving good quality (or new!) clothes that I love and can afford. Happily I’ve found both clothes and shoes ☺️ 
Thank you so much for this great service. Oh! Just ordered my first clean out bag!
Signed!
A happy customer",5
1369,"Best shopping experience: I couldn’t have enough space to write about the positives of this app. I find second hand beautiful unique pieces for myself and my kids all of the time. My outfits are always being complimented. The deals are incredible and it feels good to not buy first hand, to help the planet. I’ve found so many treasures and the customer service are extremely attentive when I reach out . I cannot speak highly enough!",5
1370,"Easy to use but prices have increased: I’ve loved shopping on ThredUP for a couple years now and I’ve had good luck with most of the items I’ve purchased. I’ve been disappointed to see that their asking prices have seemed to have gone up since they’ve become more popular. For example, I observed that they were asking more money for an item that still had a tag on it than was originally being charged on the tag. I will say that do appreciate the option to sort my searches by brands and by condition of the item!",4
1371,"Over this app: At first I loved this app; easy navigation, easy to order items, and it's even somewhat cheap. Well I ordered over 60 dollars worth of clothes about two months ago and I still haven't received anything! And whenever I go to check the shipment tracking it won't load, or it crashes the app! Also it keeps changing the delivery date as well. Keep I'm mind that I orders these clothes in time for when I stared my new job and the package should have gotten to me by now. If this app says items will ""be delivered within 5-8 businesses days,"" then I expect it to be here in a timely manner. Very disappointed with the outcome of this because I will on longer be using this app. If I could give negative ratings I would.",1
1372,"Petites not easily sorted - too time consuming to search and shop: Most established clothing merchants allow shoppers to sort for petite (or tall) clothing easily.  This app does not and it makes searching time consuming.

The app only allows you to add petite sizes into a broad search like “bring me size 8 plus include petite”.   That’s not helpful. If you’re petite it often means that you can not wear regular length clothes.  

This app doesn’t even allow you to search for the word petite effectively.  It brings back only brands with the word petite in their name, rather than all the clothes sized petite.",3
1373,"My Go-To Place For Clothes as I Lose Weight: I’ve been working hard to drop the pounds and am 30 lbs down now having gone one size smaller and near another smaller size. ThredUP is a great place to park my good too-big clothes while shopping  economically for new things while my shape is in transition.  Building a wardrobe in a new size is so expensive, but I can shop at ThredUP with peace of mind and $$ left in my wallet! It’s so much fun to shop on the app. Thanks for this service.",5
1374,"Declining App: I used to really enjoy this app and love the initiative. Unfortunately with raising costs this app no longer feels like a savings compared to buying new and the return process has become costly. The rewards program change over feels stingy. Customer service also used to be amazing but I’m currently struggling to get in contact with them and what seems like a simple correction is taking weeks. The quality of clothing is usually really good, but that means they are really picky about what they accept and they keep everything you send regardless. Overall, I will likely be returning to in person thrifting.",2
1375,"Scammer: This place scam your money. If you pay for the $10 return clean up bag, it does not mean they will send you back the items they don't sell on time. So if you send them designer clothes and shoes and items don’t sell, you will have to request to “buy” them back. They won’t automatically let you know either. Your consignment money has to be redeemed within a year, it does not automatically come to you. After a year, the money turn into store credits. And if you wait even longer, they remove all the credits out of my account. Many of my designer clothes are gone and because I am busy, I lost my $800+ funds and credits. First hand story, user beware.",1
1376,Don’t waste your time sending in your items: It takes them so long to sort through your items. I ordered a clean out bag & it took over a month for me to receive it immediately sent it back & I’m still waiting on my items to be sorted… also payouts take forever to post to your account. (Literally months) & then when you transfer to PayPal you are charged a fee. Items you order come fast but I ordered a shirt for my son & the picture showed the shirt looking brand new & when I got it it was faded bad. Just highly disappointed & I feel like they need a better system to process these items or quit offering the service all together.,1
1377,"Great Company, love it! Buy all the time.: ThredUP is a great company. They have tons of affordable options of name brands and styles to choose from for a fraction of the retail price. You can filter to even show new with tags still on. 

It is super easy to sell your own clothes without the hassle of posting pictures. They send you the bag for your stuff with free shipping, and then you get money back when they accept it. Sometimes I cash it out for real money through PayPal, and sometimes I use it for credit towards purchases. :) 

Their newer feature of earning points let you get rewards like free shipping and discounts is awesome, too!

I only didn’t do 5 stars because you generally don’t get much back when you sell things. But, that’s normal for consignment. You just need to realize it upfront. Also, this is not exactly true for selling designer things. Those you get to pick the price.",4
1378,"Don’t waste your time: I do not recommend purchasing from here. The quality control for this company is non existent. On two separate occasions, I made purchases of what was described as “like new” “with tags.”
One sweater had moth holes in it. I returned, but they charge you a restocking fee. The other purchase was listed as a sweater, but when it arrived yesterday, it was a crepe blouse. It had a 1” rip, near a seam on the back of the garment. I reported the misrepresentation and poor quality to ThredUP. I was offered nothing but a return with a charge for restocking. AGAIN! Seriously, restocking? Are they going to resell damaged merchandise to someone else? I’ve deleted the app and Reported them to the BBB. Customer Service is non existent.",1
1379,"Terrible: I sent in a huge bag of at least 30 items. I ended up with about 10 items as part of my shipment once they received it and half of them were not items that belonged to me! (They were items that belonged to someone 6 sizes up from me and at least 20 years older) I had never used the app before so I waited if they were going to update it with more but they never did. 7 of my items ended up selling and I only made about $20.. I also assumed if they didn’t get my shipment right when they received it, they probably lost my other items. Waste of time and clothing! definitely not worth the effort for the money you get.",2
1380,"Love ThredUP!: Ordering affordable, flattering clothing that fits me well and freshens up my wardrobe has made this my favorite way to shop!  Any returns I have made have been promptly credited back to my desired refund ; store credit. If size didn’t fit, or if I changed my mind on an item, no hassle to print a return label and mail it back. The items descriptions and sizes are pretty accurate. A couple times not so well but refunds are no hassle. I will continuing to use thredUP and recommend to my friends and family !",5
1381,"So far so good, room for improvement: So far I love what I see. I’ve placed a few orders and have had a wonderful time with the products I received. 

However I do have a minor recommendation?

 Because there are so many brands on the here, it would be nice to filter by measurements rather than just size, especially since a lot of the articles I’ve found have at least one measurement available. It would definitely make it easier to shop and not have to interrupt my browsing to check the brands size chart, then go back to the garment.",4
1382,"Good for buying, not for selling: This app is great if you’re looking to buy clothes. However if you’re selling you’re not getting your money work and should sell on a different app. I had 9 items and only got $8 out of it when for 1 item I should have gotten $8 for it. I understand the company takes a certain amount to keep the app going, but there are better apps where they don’t take ALL your money.  This app is very confusing. I had to pay $6 to reclaim my clothes when i thought that was why I paid $10 when I sent it??? Would not recommend selling your clothes here!!!",3
1383,"Loved it until I got my order: I loved the idea of the site but 3 of the items I got that said “Like New” were far from looking like new. I wouldn’t have paid even half what I did for the items had they been accurately described. Very frustrating and makes it hard to trust for future purchases. And this being the only place to do a survey isn’t very smart. An email that came asking how my first order was , was a bogus email where you click on the stars and it just brings you to the site to shop. Nowhere to write a review or even do a private survey, so they was my only option.",3
1384,"Dissatisfied customer: I have purchased a few thing on here and they have not been correct on the size or description of the product. I purchase a purse recently that stated that it was like new .. 
The bag has holes and the fake leather was peeling  off the bag. The bag look like it got chewed on the handles . I can’t even use the bag because it’s a piece of crap.. 
I also ordered 2 different pairs of shoes that states they where size 9 and they where not.. My daughter wears a size 8.5 and they where to tight for her .  I really liked the shoes to and I can’t even wear them.. 
 Be honest on the wear and tear of the product and show picture of the products defects so you don’t mislead the customer to buying something that they can’t use when they get it .",1
1385,"Best bang for your buck$: This app is great for selling my clothes. They do all the work for you and make it super simple to turn a profit.   In top of that, what a selection to shop from! Literally search for any designer look and you can find it on here, for much cheaper than you would find in any retail store. I love it, it's easy, fun, and totally user friendly.  Best way to sell your stuff, hands down, I've tried all the rest, but this one is the best !",5
1386,"THE EMPLOYEES STEAL YOUR ITEMS!!!: Do not send your clothes/ shoes here because the employees steal! I’ve sent a few items to them without much issue. While I was home for the holidays I decided to send over 20 pairs of shoes that I had that I rarely ever wore (some still had tags). When I got the email that my bags had been processed, only 2 of the shoes were chosen. Majority of the shoes were barely worn UGGs, so I knew immediately that there was an issue. I was told that they shoes were in good enough condition (even the ones with tags) and that they would be even away. I asked if I could get them back and they told me that was not possible. After reading other reviews, it looks like this company is known for stealing. I will never use them again. BEWARE!!",1
1387,"Review: I’ve placed many orders with Thread Up. I’ve always been generally happy with what I’ve gotten. I got one piece that was new with tags. I was very disappointed to see that Thread Up charged me MORE than what it cost brand new! Also, if you do a little research yourself, the prices for the items aren’t as much as they say they are. They say you’re saving 90% but I’ve found most of the “original” prices to be much higher than what I have found elsewhere. Also, I have sent in a lot of clothing for resale. I feel like since last year (2018) the amount of money you get for your items has decreased a lot! The average amount I got per piece was well under a dollar.",2
1388,"Worst Clothing Resale Company USE POSHMARK: Sent them a box of new or never worn or still tagged etc clothing and it cost more to mail it than they sold it. Their markup is high and they price it low - I’m sure there’s some name for such non-transparency as they never discuss how much they will list the items until it’s too late. I should have sold them on Poshmark.
I referred my sister and she send them a large bag with higher labels and never got anything back since they take it and donate items they deem “not sellable.” My question is who get the donation credit??? This company is part of the bigger picture of the downfall of the fashion industry - showing future generations to value items less and less after original sale. Fashion is not disposable.",1
1389,"Terrible customer service: I ordered a clean out kit over 2 months ago, received it within about 10 days, filled it and sent it back in about 7 days. I received an email update that my kit was received and would be processed within the next week. I have been waiting for them to process my clean out kit for about a month now. I have contacted them multiple times through the customer support on the app and if I get an answer it takes 3-4 business days at least. I was told my kit was shipped to a different facility for processing but it would be processed the following week. It’s been 2 weeks since then with no follow up and I have contacted customer support again. This time I have yet to get a response.",1
1390,"Worst mistake ever: If there was a zero rating that's what I would give.  My first clean out bag was a total of 9 items all new with tags all in current styles.  Some brands were INC, Ann Taylor, Loft, NY&Co, etc.....Bag two contained 11 items either never worn or gently worn everything in excellent condition.  The words written in descriptions of my clothes by thred up were ""you will think they are new"" 
I received 9$ for the first bag
I received 5$  for the second bag 
While I watch thred up making much more on the sale of my clothes.  Perhaps if you didn't see what they sell your items for you may just think well your taste in clothes is not that desirable as you think.  But people are by your clothes and fir a decent price.  That was my first and last time I will ever use this sight!!!!
Trust me this is not a good sight.  Go to your local consignment shop you will do much better.  
If I would've known how little I would make I would have donated my clothes.  
Only I wasn't off about how much I thought the clothes with Sell  for I was only off about how much thredUP keeps of that money
😡😡",1
1391,"I’m obsessed!: I love this app. I have hated shopping my whole life, but ThredUP makes it soooo easy. I can sit at home and search for my sizes and favorite brands. You can choose to only look at those that are new with tags if you are looking for stuff that is brand new! There are always new items and they get shipped directly to my home! If you don’t like the clothing for some reason, it’s super easy to ship back. I cannot recommend enough!!",5
1392,"Defeating its own purpose: I love the idea of thrifting on my phone, however these are not thrift store prices and it’s defeating the whole purpose. Paying shipping is understandable but why do you need to make such a large profit from people shopping sustainably? You could make plenty of profit selling at a lower price without up charging depending on the brand of USED clothes you’re getting. It’s limiting the amount of people that are able to use this service because everything’s just as expensive as at the store, why would someone pay retail price for USED clothes when they could just go buy it new??",2
1393,"Pictures could be better: Pictures for most items show good angles and almost enough detail, but for shoes, it’s hard to tell exactly what the material is (shines, matte, suede or leather etc) bc the background is pure white and the product just stands too starkly in contrast. Also hard to tell the exact shape of the toe bed. Would be nice in description to have that as well as a better picture (pointed, flat, tapered etc. ). I think it would be helpful to not always have such a bright white background. Just really hard to see the detail with that on a dark item.",3
1394,"Has the potential to be so great: ThredUP makes its users believe that they are constantly going to be saving money when the reality is as soon as they make their first purchase, they lose accessibility to sale prices.  There are benefit tiers and a points system in place for existing members, but it’s honestly a joke. It’s just a cheap distraction. I don’t care about any of those benefits I would much rather just have the sale price.

That being said, one really great thing about ThredUP is that I can get a whole bunch of items from one place and not have to worry about shipping. 

They have excellent search capabilities on their website, unfortunately, the mobile platform leaves a bit to be desired.. 

I don’t appreciate the fluctuating prices that existing members receive once they make their first purchase. I would be inclined to purchase much more if I were privy to the prices that new members are.",3
1395,"Good But Quality Control Could Be Better: I love the points and the frequent sales! My only two concerns are about damaged items and misleading measurements; once I got a coat with a missing button and a hole in the pocket and I’ve often purchased items with measurements that should have fit me but didn’t! Returns are easy, but I’d rather not have to do them so often. If ThredUp measured and checked the clothing for damage more thoroughly I’d give them 5 stars",5
1396,Quality that’s affordable and easy to use: The number one thing about this app it is easy to use it saves your personal information like your sizes so you don’t have to keep putting that in and with all the categories they have you can put it almost exactly what you’re looking for. You also get good quality you get to choose the level of quality you want and the prices are unbeatable,5
1397,"Do Better!  Accuracy Needs Work!: The folks at Thred Up need to take additional time to provide accurate information on items.  I’ve ordered a few times with hesitation because their measurements and pics. are Definitely not dependable.  Often there are no measurements or fabric content, and all photos are taken from a distance. The end result is dissatisfaction with purchases.  I’ve gotten things that are way too large and way too small, wrong color, etc. as a result.  As an online resale, accuracy in clothing details should be a top priority. How hard is it to take the time to do it right?",2
1398,"Love ThredUP, hate shipping service: I would have given 5  stars but shipping is an issue. Of course I expect longer shipping times with bundled items.  But for other orders I have experienced multiple changes and push backs on delivery dates. Not sure if this is ThredUP or if it has something to do with the FedEx branch in my area. Last 2 orders have had 3 different delivery dates and now tracking is not even bothering to update new delivery date. Other than that…my fashion obsession is being fed on a magnificent level",4
1399,"Good Finds: I’ve found some good pieces through Thred Up and have been mostly satisfied. However - placed my last order Aug 6 and stats still says, “processing.” When I go to send a message to customer service through chat, it comes back and tells me to login (even though I am logged in and using the app). It’s like a loop - tried several times and can’t get through. Never needed customer service before, and I’m really disappointed. I will not order again if I can’t get through to someone when there is a question or a problem.",3
1400,"Love Thred Up: I recently retired and needed a different type of wardrobe. Over the last few years I’ve been able to gradually transform my closet into clothes I look forward to wearing for my new lifestyle.
My one suggestion would be to please photograph the inside of handbags— I’m picky about how the inside is organized.  Also many purses are expensive, plus they are final sale.  This would really be helpful when deciding to purchase or not.  Thank you!!",5
1401,"False advertising: I will never order anything from ThredUP again. I ordered 2 pair of jeans BOTH were listed as mid rise, which was great for me because I don’t like high rise jeans. Unfortunately both jeans are high rise. The tag inside jeans clearly says high rise. I doubled checked the listing from my order and both pair say mid rise. I wouldn’t have ordered either pair if they’d be properly labeled high rise. Very very disappointed. And then to hassle with returning them and also be docked a restocking fee. I am now out over $60 and stuck with 2 pair of jeans I will never wear. How hard is it to read a label properly. Never will I waste my time or money again with ThredUP. Would have given zero stars if I could.",1
1402,"Terrible app to sell clothes and shoes: I have been using it for awhile just for convenience of cleaning out many bags of clothes and shoes before and during COVID. However, you are better off using different selling apps than this one…it’s a rip off for convenience! I have items that are $50+ and I only get $10-$15 back…WASTE! I might return to Mercari to get a real deal on selling my barely used or not used clothing and shoes…don’t waste your time plus it takes them MONTHS to process a bag of clothes and shoes for you to get nothing back from brand name clothing and shoes…I am sure it is fine for buyers but don’t bother selling here…just send them donation type clothes and sell elsewhere…",1
1403,"Just gross..: Not a single piece of clothing that is even slightly cute enough worth the price tag on them. It’s all just used ugly designer clothing made of poor quality materials that are harmful to not only yourselves and to the environment, but stuff only rich people wear to make a statement about their wealth...which is also dumb. I wouldn’t be caught dead in a single piece of clothing they have on this app. If you want ugly and gross looking styles that you pay outrageous prices for like these, then save yourself some money and just go shop the local Salvation Army or Goodwill for the same style and quality clothing for just pennies on the dollar instead. In fact, I’m sure those places will have better quality clothing than this app..wow!!",1
1404,"Thredup is a life saver: As a college student who doesn’t have a ton of money but also wants nice, name brand clothes, thredup is a total life saver. It’s definitely really time consuming to find what you want, but if you take the time you can find amazing deals. The fact that you can filter clothes by your sizes is so different and really, really helpful. 
 
My only complaint would be that you can’t search for specific item qualities like “chunky heels” or “long cardigan”. If only they could implement that!",5
1405,"Like all internet purchases, be slightly wary: I love the idea of ThredUP and I’ve used the app to purchase, BUT - the pictures leave something to be desired and the search function is pretty bad.  I ordered a pair of pants that I realized upon receiving them were petite.  If I had checked the inseam measurement that WAS listed, I may have noticed they seemed short, but honestly, I would think they would list as “Medium Petite” or “6 Petite.”  Also, dress pants/casual pants are often listed as the same thing - not exactly helpful when searching for office work wear. It’s all usually too cheap for me to bother returning, but it can be frustrating.",3
1406,Good customer service: This is the most frustrating site.  I received an alert that an item I favorited was reduced and when I clicked on it it had a great “final sale” price.   But when I put it in my cart it’s not the lower price.  I tried to chat with customer service but they were no help and took forever to respond.   I see know other way to get help.    Not sure I want to shop with them.    Customer service did contact me the next morning and helped me to figure things out.    I will recommend them to all my thrifty shopper friends.,4
1407,Great shopping.: I really do love shopping second time around stuff. And being able to send in our worn items is even better. There are a few things I would change or wish were different. the amount of time to keep something in your cart should be a little longer. The “Bundle” should be available on the app too. I wish the description was better on the clothes. I have to send stuff back a lot because I couldn’t tell from the pictures what the item was like. they could give a little more on the items they keep. Anyway still enjoy it.,3
1408,Do not order the goody boxes: Do not order the goody boxes. They gave me everything in the wrong size and in the same color despite having provided them a description of what I wanted as well as the Pinterest board that they asked for. They refused to refund my deposit when I couldn’t keep anything because nothing sent to me was in the right size. I don’t think their stylists actually care despite their advertising to do so. They’re just throwing things in boxes knowing they’ll hold on to your deposit whether you like what’s in the box or not.,4
1409,"Love this app: I love this app & thred up. I've purchased a lot of lovely items, shipping is always prompt and I've received everything as expected. I've not ever tried to sell items I already have or tried to return anything so I don't know how convenient that is. The only complaint I have regarding previous purchases I've made here is that I have received a few things that were visibly dirty and although I wash everything purchased prior to wearing I just found that to be a turn off.",5
1410,"Love ThredUp!: I regularly shop at local consignment stores, but ThredUp will be my new go-to! It's much more convenient to shop online and they have a large selection of brands I love at a more affordable price. Just placed my first order today! It's also a great resource to clean out your closet. You can choose to donate your old clothes and receive a tax write-off, they will also recycle your clothes properly, or you can send in clothes for potential store credit. Looking forward to cleaning out my closet!",5
1411,"My favorite shopping app!: It’s my #1 shipping app. Hands down,  it’s one the best shopping app. App is user-friendly and easy to navigate. It allow me to explore and shop my favorite designers, making it so convenient. Prices are unbeatable! As a VIT member, I enjoy free shipping on all order $39+ which saves me incredible amount of money. Majority of items purchased in “like new” condition, exactly as described.  Very satisfied with all my purchases!  I highly recommend!!!",5
1412,"New search makes the app unusable: I love this app, but the new search updates are horrible! I am now receiving tons of results that do not pertain to my search, especially when searching for a particular brand & getting a bunch of other brands included in the mix. That is not “relevant” to me. Stop thinking for me! The results should be what I’ve searched for, not what you think I might also like. This will not make me stay on the app longer trying to find what I was actually looking for, but rather closing it altogether & looking elsewhere.",3
1413,"Life changer!: I can’t even believe I ever paid the ridiculous prices for retail! This app has saved me thousands within just a few years. I have invited many friends who are so grateful as well. I highly, highly recommend this to all shoppers! The items come in a timely manner and are so cared for to the point that they even wrap them individually with tissue paper. I am blown away each time I receive my package. This company is amazing!",5
1414,"Just received my order: I bought (2) prs of trousers/Pants/Slack, the leather pants a so soft and fit perfectly. The second pair from Nordstrom Rack with tickets still on, also fits perfectly, just need to have them taken up. Both do not look like they have ever been worn, good quality and fabulous design. I can’t believe l was so lucky, thank you so much. I love thrifting, but l can’t find the time, so thrifting online is much better and so convenient for me. I love your app",5
1415,"Budget mom: So, I’ve really enjoyed shopping on here , most of the items fit and a few were too big or small even picking the same size like the others.  I love the fact that some of these clothes are in great shape.  Some are in decent shape, but you can filter all of those options.  The reason why I’m giving it 2 stars only is because they went on on their free shipping minimum.  
I was a little disappointed that thredup went up on their shipping.  I’ve earned up to superstar level and you get free shipping if you purchase $59 or more. 

Unfortunately, it’s went up after the New Year to $69 .",2
1416,"Thrifting for Me: ThredUP has opened so many doors that I can’t get from going store to store thrifting. I need clothes in Tall sizes and it’s just not something I expect goodwill or a local secondhand shop to have on hand or be able to sort or label. Having so many items, clearly labeled, sortable by size, color, length, fabric, anything under the sun? It makes buying previously worn clothes easier to find. I love giving these pieces a second life with me in them!",5
1417,"I love this idea and the clothes are fantastic!: It’s so hard to find good and fitting clothes online but Threadup has it all! The selection is great and best of all, they show exact measurements for things. Exact sizes vary between makers, but If you have a tape and can measure your bust etc. you can order things that fit perfectly every time. Everything I’ve gotten so far has fit perfectly and been in great condition. All items I now wear often!",5
1418,"Not always a bargain: I shop at thred up quite a bit. I have gotten some good deal and some crappy ones.  Not everything is described correctly. I have had things described as “minor wear” and received it and it had a hole. Something’s were described as “little to no signs of wear” and it was faded, stained or had a hole. I mostly only buy things that are “new with tags” now. I feel like thred up has declined in the last few years. They need to be more picky with what they sell, especially since the prices are not always cheaper than the store sales.",3
1419,"One star: On several occasions I have mailed in very expensive and new items (gifts I never wore) that were in great condition. They were deemed not adequate for sale and kept. Yet the items I have bought have always been stretched out and what I would rate as poor condition. Some even had stains. I’ve only had one item I’ve been happy with. I contacted costumer support and it’s my fault as I didn’t purchase return insurance. So thred up ended up with my 200 dollar boots and much much more, with no option to get them back. Yet if I search items for sale, I see the exact boots and size posted. Read all the fine print. They offered no solution through costumer service.",1
1420,Great quality at a fraction of the cost: Good quality name brand clothing and other items at fraction of the cost in the stores. I have purchased several items that still had the price tags. I’m really impressed with the quality of the items. All of the used items I have purchased that were used gently still look brand new. Buy used and save the difference from ThredUP you won’t regret it!!,5
1421,"Such a fan of ThredUP: I sourced my entire resort wear work wardrobe from here and I tell everyone about ThredUP!! I am obsessed and such a believer in this way to shop - fast fashion and the waste in the fashion industry really really bothers me as a consumer and a designer, and this is such a badly needed service and platform. I hope this company soars and thrives, I express myself through my style and this site allows me to curate a statement wardrobe within my budget. Love it and deeply respect what they’re trying to do.",5
1422,"Used it for years!!: I really love shopping with ThredUP but my problem with them is time. It takes a couple weeks to receive orders, it takes even longer for returns to be received and processed and don’t ask how long it takes for sale bags to be processed. Other than that, I love not spending full price and buying used, I love that returns are easy and that shopping is easy and fun. I have recommended them to many.",5
1423,"A dilemma: I have been using this app for its sustainable and second hand clothing utility. I am happy with the shopping but I feel that going to local second hand shops will ease my concerns of when my closet will be up for sale. I understand it’s a pandemic and all but it will be close to 3 months before I can see the cloths up on site at this point.
It is unfortunate as I was using this app for some research about sustainability. I hope they find more help.",5
1424,"Great clothes, price, and selection but….: I do love it this site/app, they have the great clothes, prices, and selection but my only issue is that you can’t contact the seller or anyone without it taking 24hr. I have bought 8 pairs of pants; most were $20 a pc, the inseam was wrong Or not listed…only 3 of those 8 actually fit me…so I do wish that there was a way to contact someone about to the clothes if there are any questions about measurements or whatever. Other than that I do love what I find on here!",4
1425,"Great, to poor: I have had this app for almost a year and have embarrassingly ordered about once a month. When I first started using I always got coupons and promos and the orders came SO quickly. Now, when I order things it takes a long time. One order took 3 weeks to arrive. I actually opened a second account to see if I would get deals like I had when I first opened an account, and an order I placed with the second account arrived BEFORE the order I placed with my original account. Totally bummed they only seem to value and want to please new customers not us reoccurring customers.",2
1426,"Customer service: I have been trying to contact customer service for a week.  I’ve sent messages and have heard back from no one.  I can not find a number to call and every time I try the chat, as suggested on website, it never even lets me chat with a person.  I purchased two products as “excellent condition”.  One was a bag that is so dry rotted, it literally crumbles when you touch it.  The other is a sweater with so much pilling on it, there are nearly holes in both shoulders.  I will say, I have ordered from them for years and the past two orders are the only time this has happened. How do you get in touch with an actual person at your company???",1
1427,"Greatest Finds: I love ThredsUp!! I can buy and sell, donate, whatever works for me and it is great for the environment as well as gives all the sellers out there some extra cash!!  My goodie boxes have been amazing. I buy a surprise goody box each season!! The designers pull together amazing looks I could never put together myself. ThredUp, I am one of best fans!! I love your web site with all the designer favorites and wardrobe ideas. Your wardrobe ideas make me rock so many new looks. Yeah!!",5
1428,"Search function is rubbish: Search is totally useless. Search “black sundress”, and every other colour and type of dress comes up. Search “pajama pants” and it shows you outerwear trousers. Etc. Also if you try to search something specific like “black a-line skirt with elastic waistband” , it has no idea what you’re talking about and turns up no results. Photos are often not good enough to see enough detail of the item. Fabric descriptions aren’t always accurate; I was searching summer dresses and bought what I thought was a casual summer dress, only to receive it and discover it was velvet. Needs major improvement.",2
1429,Once impressed customer is done: Beyond disappointed in the way they handle their bids...I have used this function multiple times and it occasionally glitches.  I called today they told me my cc on file was declined but I called the cc company and they said no such charge had been attempted.  Then a sweater I wanted had gone up $20 from my bid to the search I did to buy it once I realized something was wrong. Then customer service magically can’t find it and it sold...all in about the 10 second span of when we were chatting about the issue.  Done done done.  By the way half the time the stuff you end up with is beat up way more than they advertise.  There are much better places to shop!!,1
1430,"Love it !!!!: I have been using ThreadUp for about a year now. And I can't believe all the great items of clothing, shoes and handbags that I have been able to find. The quality is amazing.  
Im always getting complemented  on something that i have purchased from ThreadUp. I have recommended it to family and friends and honestly recommend it to you. You cant go wrong you'll find such good deals that you will defiantly  be hooked -just like me.",5
1431,"Love the app: I have really enjoyed finding deals that are specifically my interest, example - jeggings, Duluth, etc. the clothing has been gorgeous and the number of things that hasn’t worked has been small compared to what I have loved. What I don’t like - invite someone you get a $10 discount BUT you have to use it within a certain amount of time. So I lost mine because I didn’t have time to do the shopping in that time frame.",5
1432,"LOVE Thredup: This is a great fit for my tighter than tight budget. I enjoyed getting “final sale” items. I can get a whole outfit name brand for less than going to a discount shop, or the mall, 
There’s always a big selection in my not so easy petite and Jr size.

The items are always adequately described. Sometimes I get flawed items because I’ve got to clean house in something.

I ALWAYS shop final sale knowing if I don’t love it like I though I would I can gift, or donate it. 

I have been a thrift shopper since childhood. This is so much easier than going to several thrift stores, sorting through piles and finding nothing. I always anticipate my box.

I have donated lots of clothing to benefit Girls Inc, using the “clean out bag.”- previously loved clothing goes in the bag.— Thredup pays postage and then donates $5 to your selected charity. It’s the ultimate feel good “up cycling.”",5
1433,"Terrible from every perspective: I was excited to see this app because I’m an avid thriftier. However, upon downloading it I realized that their selection for bigger bodies (I’m a plus size woman) is vile. Shapeless garments galore. When I went to give feedback on their social media, I uncovered horrible reviews from both buyers and sellers. They misheard items, send fur covered clothing, and “lose” sellers clothing only to list it on the site without paying what’s due. Speaking of payment, you get literal pennies in the dollar for everything they sell, but they’ll only take about twenty percent of what you give them (and you have to pay to get what they don’t want to sell returned to you.) sell on eBay and you’ll make more money. This is pathetic.",1
1434,"So far so good: I’ve made two purchases and received one so far. I ordered three pairs of jeans, although they don’t fit me (not thred up’s fault, I haven’t worn the brands before and didn’t know what size I was) the items were accurate to the picture and description. Took 12 days from day of purchase until I received my items, but they did come from different places in the U.S. Don’t order if you need them for something really soon. Oh and I love the bundle & save option!",5
1435,"New and best way to shop!: A friend recommended ThredUP to me and I just thought it was another thrift site. Little did I know, I could find exactly what I was searching for and even some of the classic older styles/better quality I really have come to miss from JCrew. And there are other favorite brands either new or in very great condition! The app allows very easy searching so when I’m looking for a specific color top or pants, I will now go to ThredUP instead of buying new. Five stars all around!!!!",5
1436,"Great service extremely slow shipping: I haven’t received my packages yet. Placed order on Tuesday, and it’s Friday now, 2 of 3 packages have only had shipping labels received. Which means it did me no good to pay more for faster delivery because my packages haven’t been dropped in the mail yet 4 days after I purchased. The online app is great, easy to use. Coupon is great too. But most likely would not use this again, since it will take over 1 full week to receive what I purchased.",5
1437,"Yikes: Thought I’d give buying a shot after a less than great selling experience and YIKES. Ordered a pair of lululemon leggings, they sent me a completely different pair and then said I could return them but that they couldn’t send me the item I actually ordered. Seems fishy and seems fraud-y. To list an item and then ship a totally different (and lesser) item than what was pictured/described hoping the customer won’t make a stink about it and even if they do you’ll crush them with your terrible return policy. To be honest I don’t even trust this company to refund my money upon returning the incorrect item they wrongfully sent me. Read lots of other reviews repeating similar situations. Not a good look to actively and continuously defraud your costumers.",1
1438,"Very disappointed: Let me just start by saying I have NEVER given a company a bad review in my life! I downloaded this app very excited to clean my closet out and make some money and donate clothes! My first thredUP bag came and I made about $80 for semi-decent clothes and I was impressed! I was so happy I told friends and family about the company and some of them ordered cleanout bags for themselves! I decided to order another bag and filled it with mostly name brand clothes including J.Crew, Lilly Pulitzer, Nike and Under Armor. I was pretty upset when I only received $7 for this bag of clothes that were WAY nicer than the first bag of clothes I sent... I will not be ordering anymore cleanout bags and I will no longer recommend this business to friends and family.",1
1439,"A Good Shopping App: Update:  8/15 While the app is still easy to use, the prices have gone UP! Several items I saw @ $11-$15 are NOW $35-40!!! And, that was within a day. Considering that most of the brands can offer you the same price if you just wait for the sales, it's odd that the ThredUp would raise the price of USED CLOTHES! Plus, there are a lot of sustainable brands and websites these day that offer better brands.

Pros: environmental, easy to use, well known brands, like-new clothes, good customer service, $0.99 items.

Cons: some items change price. I've noticed that it might be $10 one day and then $40 the next day.",3
1440,The best thrift shop online hands down!!: I love ordering from thred up!!! I have made so many orders and gotten so many great things. Not to mention the fact you can send in your not needed clothes and handbags and much more in exchange for cash to your PayPal as well as credit. I have sent in several bags of my stuff and for the most part they have sold at good prices. I just love everything about Thred Up. Try it and you will love it too.,5
1441,"App update is a mess: I’m not even browsing anymore, which I used to do frequently, because the new app update screws up all my searches. I had plenty of saved searches but now when I click into them I only can view a fraction of the total available. And when I sort by newest in a brand I only get shoes and accessories? I can’t swipe to see the back of a garment in thumbnail and clicking on a saved favorite unusually takes me to another random item in my favorites. The glitches go on and on. And I’m on a brand new iPhone so I don’t know who this update is for. So no shopping for me until the app gets sorted. Maybe it’s for the best. Save my money.",1
1442,"My Favorite obsession! 😊: Thred Up is addictive in the extreme for anyone who enjoys the pursuit of the hunt for that one unique elusive item! I won’t disclose how many hours in the past year I’ve spent down this particular rabbit hole — suffice to say that I’ve earned a VIT rating (Very Important Thrifter) and discounts as a result of my relentless orders! Save the planet - reduce, reuse, recycle, AND REJOICE in the one-of-a-kind fabulous items you’ll enjoy finding here at the end of your search! (PS - Items change DAILY!😊)",5
1443,"It’s honestly really good: Items arrived in very good condition, they were a bit dirty but that’s to be expected and will easily be fixed after a wash cycle.

If you’re going to buy from them definitely check each item for bedbugs (I didn’t find any but I’ve heard a few stories) and make sure they are in good condition. Obviously wash them before use.

Everything fits very well, which as a thin and tall transgender woman I was worried about as sizes don’t tend to translate very easily and with male clothes I always struggled to get a good fit. I am glad for thredUP as it’s making transitioning a fair bit more affordable. you can’t get everything second-hand but you can still get quite a lot of value. + sustainability is always a great thing.

I’ll definitely be using thredUP again.",5
1444,"RFR Audrey: I Love ThredUP!Ive been a satisfied customer for a couple years now,and many of my friends have become loyal customers too after admiring my great purchases and hearing what I paid they couldn’t believe it!I have purchased Designer Bags,shoes and clothes,sometimes still in the stores,but at such great savings!I’ve also found some Vintage Items No longer available in stores,but still very iconic & fabulous!Thank You ThredUP!Best,Audrey,A Very Satisfied Customer",5
1445,"My Go To Shopping Store: Every time I am looking for something new, ThredUP is the first place I will check. I love the rewards system to help cover shipping and even get money off already great prices!

My only suggestions are to add more pictures of the items. ESP for jeans and leggings add a shot of the crotch so we can determine wear there. In addition if you could add the waist sizes ok skirts!! Its the only item I can’t purchase on here because I can’t go based on size alone.",5
1446,"UI is not great: I used to love the app and have been a user for years.  But the filters are terrible.  For instance, filtered to “wide leg/trouser” jeans and getting over 5,000 results many of which are skinny leg or jeggings.  I don’t want to spend an hour sifting through the results to see what i actually want.  Under My Account, there’s a link that says Give Us Feedback- which doesn’t go anywhere.  Chat with customer service is specific to orders.  So guess I’m limited to giving my feedback here; with no ability to filter i will not be using the app.",3
1447,"Great for buying women’s clothes & for donation.: Great for buying women’s clothes & for donation/earning a couple bucks. Love it, have used many, many times. However, children’s clothes are really too expensive compared with other avenues for used kids items and selling takes FOREVER and yields basically no cash. (FYI the Athleta Gift Card program they have going is fantastic!!! Much better $ yield that way.) If this doesn’t bother you the site is wonderful. Have bought half my wardrobe from them!",4
1448,"Great concept but refund policy is awful: I love this concept. There are great deals to be had here but the refund policy is awful. When ordering clothing online, there will inevitably be returns if things don’t fit correctly. The app states on items that there is a $1.99 restocking fee, which I understand. But I ordered $164 worth of items and ended up returning $64 worth of items because I didn’t like the fit. The refund I received for 4 items, totaling $64 was only $23. So if you think you may need to return some items, it becomes a huge waste of money.",3
1449,"Customer support and webpage could use improvements: I’ve been in love with thred up but I’ve reached out to the company TWICE about my order and no one’s gotten back to me. There’s no phone. I bet just come chat service and I don’t like that there’s no copy of what I’ve sent for my records. 
The website also doesn’t confirm which method you’d like for refunds before you submit and errors can be created due to page refresh/not confirming HOW you want the return done just in case. So I’m not super thrilled this time with the lack of response from the company.",3
1450,"No Men’s Section | Arbitrary Nonsense: This company will accept kids, juniors, & women’s clothing right off the bat, but not mens! Why!? So PLUS size is available (not surprising at this point), but not the grown men. What, are our clothes too short to be on your platform… obviously that’s a dry joke, but that’s not the point. For some reason this app has over 240,000 reviews or star ratings yet they don’t have men’s clothing. If I’m not mistaken, this company had been established in 2009. I’m extremely disappointed after 13 years of this company being in business that they haven’t even tried. You(consumer/thrifter), do what you will, but if I were you, I would take my business somewhere else.",1
1451,"Absolutely favorite customer: I purchased 3 items, vera Bradley bag, a wallet with Velcro which made my day, and a 31 wristlet.  It was like Christmas when I opened the box.  This was my first time buying and I bought it with free shipping.  I love the thing.  I think this is wonderful that you can go online and purchase gentle used items at a fair price.  Thank you again for everything.  I will be looking at least 2 -3xs a week.  Highly recommend!!!!!😊",5
1452,"Worth the $5.40 I paid: For sure made the purse look in better condition online than it was truly in when I opened the box. It’s more worn than they made it seem to be and explained it to be… it was only $5.40 so I ain’t mad at em, but I hope it lasts as an everyday purse when I’m just on the go because I hate using my expensive brand name purses for everyday use, like trips to Walmart and the Dollar Tree! Anyways, luckily I’ll fit right in with this purse I purchased/received and the condition it’s in. I don’t even think Plato’s Closet would accept it tbh, glad I went with my gut and went cheap and just hoping the straps stay intact.",2
1453,"Do not buy jeans: I love thredUP… for some things. Buying tops, jackets, and dresses has usually been great! However, every time I try to order bottoms, particularly jeans, it’s a huge disappointment. These issues have happened multiple times:

1. Measurements are not what is listed. I’ve ordered a pair of jeans specifically inches larger than what I ordered last, wanting a looser look. Despite both being thredUP’s measurements, the larger will somehow be way tighter than the original. 
2. The cuts are not as listed. I’ve ordered straight leg and gotten skinny jeans. Or order skinny and get rockstar ultra skinny. These little variations are important and make a huge difference in comfort. 

In conclusion, I’ve tried many times to get bottoms in my thredUP orders and have been burned almost each time. Never again.",5
1454,"Perfect for shopping in the pandemic!: As someone who gets a thrill from thrifting and is on a budget, ThredUP has saved me during the pandemic when I’ve been too cautious to sift through used clothing in person. Their prices are a bit higher than typical consignment and thrift shops, but their selection is great and their sales make everything so affordable. I freshened up my fall wardrobe last year for $67 with ThredUP and constantly get compliments on my outfits.",5
1455,"The best way to shop: I’m in love with ThredUP! Not only do I feel great about shopping more sustainably, but the options are incredible. Anything I could ever want from a casual beach dress, to a designer cocktail dress or a Disneybound outfit. Shopping for my teenager is even better since I don’t have to drag her through the mall only to find a few things she likes. She can pick from all of the trendy stores for a fraction of the price and try out so many looks.",5
1456,"Use to love now I hate it!: ThredUP use to be so helpful especially when you sent clothes to them but I sent them a bag almost three months ago and haven’t heard anything back from them besides that they have received it. I understand if they wanted none of the items but no one has even sent a message. Plus there were two designer dresses in the bag I figured they would take. Also it’s impossible to get in touch with someone to see why you have gotten no update on the clothes you sent. Honestly, they use to have the best customer service but it has gone to trash in the past few months. Buy clothes BUT DO NOT SELL THEM YOUR CLOTHES BECAUSE IT IS MORE HASSLE THAN WHAT IT IS WORTH!!!!!!!!",1
1457,"Happy App: As a seller, the app is mostly great and an easy way to keep tabs on activity on the go. There are some minor glitches that require occasional visits to the site on a desktop but they are minor (something shows twice as both sold and unavailable, incorrect payout amounts, inability to pick some numbers when making a price change). I also wish the seller was allowed to add some commentary about the item. This could add to the buyer’s experience and evaluation.",5
1458,"a lot of hidden fees: For a company that claims to be to be a consignment and thrift store helping the planet, they have several hidden fees, especially when returning and reclaiming items. On top of them already keeping a large percentage of the sold items, when you make a purchase and would like to return items, there is very small return window, a restocking fee per item and a fee for a return label. And if you would like to reclaim your items that items that did not sell, you choice to have them shipped back, you have to pay for shipping. Seems like they are more concerned about their profit rather than actually being a consignment/thrift store.",1
1459,"False descriptions: I purchase 3 dresses all labeled New with Tags.. True all had tags but were clearly worn .. one of them had two black scuff marks on the bag and all had faded materials.. That was disgusting .. I was under the impression that they were as state as New with tags like I personally own clothes new with tags that I have not worn .. First and last purchase

there is nothing to make this right.. except my full refund.. to sell used soiled and badly soiled stained clothes , faded and used as new with tags is disgusting and unacceptable. I will delete rhe app once i get my full refund..",4
1460,"Love thredUP: I love using the app to shop my clothing needs every month. It’s more convenient than going to the actual thrift store. The items are good quality and a good price. The good prices help me stretch my budget and get more for my money. Items are always added and changing and you can be notified when they have a desired item in stock.  If needing a return, the label is free and only $1.99 restocking fee. That’d be spent on gas just getting to the store. I love it and am glad to have found it!",5
1461,"So Many Missing Features: I wish there was a way to save certain search criteria besides just “My Sizes.” I never buy used clothes that are in worse condition than “Like New” because in my experience it’s a waste of money, but I have to set those conditions with *every search.* It would also be nice if the specific settings you enter don’t get changed when you switch search terms unless you intentionally reset them—like if I want to search for sweaters, and then tunics, and then cardigans from FP & Anthropologie, I shouldn’t have to go in and select those two brands over and over.",3
1462,"Love it!: I’ve been happy with the quality of the clothes and the ease of returning them if they don’t fit.  I always return items for store credit, as I know I’ll find something else later if something doesn’t work out.  The prices can’t be beat!  The only negative is how long it takes to receive the “clean out” bags.  Why would it take three weeks to receive a plastic shipping bag?  It’s not a deal breaker, though.",5
1463,"Awesome thrifting app: This app makes thrifting from home exceptionally easy. Offering measurements for most articles of clothing, with easy returns through the mail. Searching for what you want is easy too. The only reason I’m not giving it five stars is sometimes trying to search a specific style doesn’t work, even though those options are available. However their stock is MASSIVE so I understand why it would be hard to organize by every single option. Seriously has changed the way I shop.",4
1464,"Good overall!: I've ordered a few times from thredup and I usually like what I get. It comes very quickly and it's packaged very nicely and the items are what was shown.
I had to contact customer service a couple of times about a return and they were so helpful! I also loved the fact that it was over chat so I didn't have to call. 
I do wish they took more pictures of more angles of the items (like the back and overhead view of shoes), but otherwise I love it!",5
1465,"Awful: Please consider just donating your items to a local charity instead. Thread up paid me $1 for some nice, almost new items. Think Joie, A&F, etc. brands. And then they resell it for $20+ each. Next time I will just give my stuff away. The checkout process is crazy, you have to wait 10 days for the money to be available even if you choose the cashout option. And they charge you fees on top of the PayPal fee to transfer the money. The app is impossible to navigate, always kicks you out, and you can’t find anything. All around it’s such an incredible waste of time for what you get, it’s easier to just not bother. Consider Poshmark as an alternative, at least you can price your stuff fairly. Or donate. 😊",1
1466,"Best. Thrift. Store. Ever.: Honestly, I never have written a review for anything before. ThredUP is the best clothing store I have ever used. My favorite dress - 10 dollars. My favorite swimsuit - 8 dollars. And they have some seriously amazing deals on clothes. They make shopping so easy and hassle free. You can even use PayPal! Which is a feature I especially enjoy. I have bought so many clothing items from thredUP and I’m planning on sending some stuff out for them to sell soon. 10/10 definitely recommend.",5
1467,"Love this concept: This is a great idea! The clothes are in excellent condition, clean, orders ship quick, and returns are super easy. I have loved everything so far. I wish they would offer coupons or discounted shipping at times though. At first if you download the app, you get free shipping, but after a while that goes away. Around holidays (even when we ""fell back"" in the fall) they used to offer 15-20% off but that seems to have stopped as well. I am still a huge fan though",5
1468,"Love Thred Up so far: I have used Thred Up for a couple of years now and I usually get great items but for the times I don’t, they are easy to return and  are fair with everything.  I would highly recommend but also zoom in on photos and do your research on the items before buying. It’s an online thrift store so keep that in mind. Either way I will continue to use this app for my daughter’s clothing and summer finds.",5
1469,"AWESOME 😍💋: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ❤️ THIS APP. 
I’ve only ordered once so far; but it was a great experience!!! I hate to say it but I had a better experience with this merchant then some of my absolute favorite online retailers. 
It was even packaged very nicely, in a nice box with tissue paper. It looked really nice! I give them 5 ⭐️‘s
And more if I could ! Also it was a very quick process from order to delivery and I think my shipping was actually free for first time buyer. 
Love love love love love this app!!!❤️🧡💛💚💙💜❤️🧡💛💚💙💜",5
1470,"Missing Order: I was excited over this app initially because I wanted to buy second hand. Some of the items have tags and things are reasonably priced especially for designer pieces. As time has gone on, I’ve been fairly frustrated.

First one of my clean outs that was sent into them got lost in transit. This clean out had several designer items. They sent me 50 dollars for the loss but this clean out was my largest. I loved a lot of pieces in it but my style is changing as I enter my thirties. I had to send several emails before I got an answer

I’ve ordered from other things from the site but I ordered a jumpsuit months ago and it hasn’t shown up. I’ve been scared to order anything since. Again I’ve messaged them a few times over it and I haven’t gotten much in response. They told me to talk to USPS or UPS but they’re almost impossible to get a response from too.

Overall I got some cool clothes but it’s been a disappointing experience.",2
1471,"Love this cheap alternative to going shopping!!!!: I am a very skinny female with long legs and I can never find my size in any store; on this app, I’ve found my size in literally everything!  What a cheap alternative to fighting crowds and over spending!!! I’ve been more than satisfied with everything I’ve purchased and I’ve gotten great brand name clothing at a discounted price!  Keep up the great work guys; I’ll keep referring my family and friends to this app!",5
1472,"My favorite online clothing shop: Steering away from fast-fashion, I try to purchase all my clothes sustainably via thrift stores. Finding this online thrift store has been game changing! Not only are the prices decent, if something doesn’t fit quite right I can easily return it.
I’m spending less time running down thrift store isles and instead search for the specific clothing item I need down to the fabric type.",5
1473,"Takes forever: Options to shop second hand are always great - but they take forever to ship (and just as long if you send something back for credit). Take at least 2 weeks to receive anything and the same if not more every time I send something back (because sizing is also very annoying and inaccurate) even though I send everything with 2 day mail. 

There are good deals every so often and it can be cheaper than some other sites, only sometimes is it worth it.",3
1474,"Great app to bargain hunt! Always high quality: I have had this app for about a year now and I absolutely love it. If you put in the time to search through everything you can find great deals on high end items. I order a lot of blazers and blouses and all of them come in good condition and have lasted through being worn almost every day. 
There are different discount codes that rotate throughout the seasons, and selling your items is easy. There is no reason to not get threadUp.",5
1475,"I wish…: This site has potential, but with only 2 pictures of what’s being sold (occasionally 3, sometimes 1) and NO description of the item, besides occasional measurements and a one word analysis on the condition, buyers don’t know what they’re buying and there’s ZERO way of asking simple questions! 
Think of how much more money could be made if you only offered a little bit more to your consumers? Even with your low pricing, eBay will always trample you unless you make some minimal changes. AND THE FACT YOU LIST YOUR ITEMS ON eBAY DOESN’T change the fact you DON’T provide your consumer with enough info!",2
1476,"It’s so convenient & easy to find what you’re looking for: I loooove threadup, I’ve ordered a couple things & I always find myself on the app. Although prices are not as cheap as regular thrift stores, they are still very affordable. I also order when there’s promo codes so that I get more $ off. I love it because I can buy brands that I don’t have access to where I live. Threadup also gives you the condition of the clothes but yet again these are clothes that have been worn before so you’re not 100% sure what you getting.",4
1477,Descriptions are terrible.: I have ordered from Thred up a few times over the past couple years and every time I am disappointed. I just recently bought 2 pairs of jeans and both said they were boot cut. When I received them neither are boot cut and the label in both pairs clearly say “skinny”.  I had the same problem the last time I ordered from them.  Not even worth it to return them since they charge a restocking fee and a processing fee. I have also tried selling items to them as well. The first time was over a year ago and was fine. The last time was a few months ago and was not worth it at all. I won’t be buying from them again nor would I recommend them to anybody.,1
1478,"Enjoying buying and selling: So far having a pretty good experience. There has been some mislabeling/miscategorization of some items. Necessitates very careful reading of posts and a bit of a willingness to take a chance when placing an order. However, when I received a shirt that didn’t fit, I didn’t have a problem returning it. I have placed several orders and just sent some items in for sale and have been pleased. Aside from some (what I consider pretty minor) kinks to work out I like Thred Up and recommend it to my friends.",4
1479,"Terrible Customer Service: I have been using ThredUp for awhile now and have had more issues and bad experiences than good. I have received items that were absolutely not the item advertised. Most recently they sent me a used pair of Lucky jeans instead of a brand new pair with tags still attached of 7 for All Mankind jeans and when I reached out to them their response was we will refund you when you send the jeans we sent you back in but have relisted the jeans you wanted so you will have to buy them again???? I already bought them, send me the jeans I bought. After this last fiasco I am done with ThredUp and have asked them to delete my account. As of today still no refund or no new jeans.....",1
1480,"Saved Searches are the bomb diggity: I shop secondhand as a first option, only buying new when absolutely necessary. ThredUp’s saved search option, with its fine-tuning filtering, lets me keep tabs on a certain brand of jean (in my size), my favorite athletic brands, and was a superstar when it came to finding an LBD for my sister - I could be so specific! It’s like talking to someone who works at the thrift store....except ten times better because I can use the app while at home in my pjs.",5
1481,"Easy, Breezy, sustainable: The above subject line is how I would describe my experience on this app EVERYTIME! The app is so so user friendly its a joy to shop around and change the filters. Really narrowing down and hunting for that perfect article of clothing. I love the buy and bundle shipping option to further help with our fight to save the world #choseused.

I have a few special occasions coming up and our first family photoshoot since our kiddo was born,  and I just found all the pieces I was looking for and then some 😁

Also, I am doing all of this from my bed while my kiddo sleeps peacefully in the next room. I don’t have to worry about finding the time in between every to bring her with me while I go browse a few stores. It’s not fun for either of us haha 

So thanks for it all, is basically where I am going with this ramble!",5
1482,An Amazing Site: A friend recommended this site and I have made a few orders and sent in a bag of clothes. I love anything that can help us all be a little greener and the app’s second hand clothing is a great way to achieve a cleaner earth. I have found great items I love on this site. The payout for the items seems fair since donating the clothes would result in making no cash. I think this a great app that combines the convenience of online shopping and thrift stores all in one. I give this app two 👍👍.,5
1483,"Amazing Site!: I recommend this app to all of my friends, I honestly won’t shut up about it! I’ve always loved going to second hand stores to search for designer items at low prices, and now it’s all in my hands! Designer items are even sorted out for you so you don’t need to look for them, and they’re much better than any of what you’ll find in the other stores! I highly recommend you try this out if you have expensive taste and smaller wallets!",5
1484,App easy to use - thredUP could improve other areas: I have shopped thredUP for several years and love the ease of using the app. Have made many great buys! Overall I have had positive experiences. I would suggest ThredUP show pictures of the insides of purses if they are going to be final sale. I hate the restocking fee that was initiated. Sometimes it makes it not worth sending items back and I end up keeping things I really don’t want or that don’t fit. I won’t sell any more clothes because the payout is too minimal but I will continue shopping.,4
1485,"Okay to Buy From; don’t use their Clean Out Feature: I’m super disappointed in this company. I purchased things from them originally even though I felt it a bit high to restock items at $1.99 each if they didn’t fit. I decided to send them some clothing from my closet clean out to see if I could make some money back. I understood the premise that it wouldn’t be a lot of money per item and that some might get turned down, but I was shocked that after sending them a giant (think easily 3ft x 3ft) bag stuffed with gently used or like new clothing, they accepted about 7 items at $0.55 each. What a crock. I will be deleting the app as I feel it’s a rip off.",2
1486,"Disappointed: The app works just fine but the company is making a killing off of sellers. Is give zero stars if I could. I can’t speak as a buyer as I haven’t used this company to buy and likely won’t because I’m so unhappy as a seller. The amount I was offered for my accepted clothing was ridiculously low. This company is making a killing off of sellers. Brand new with tags items that I’m being given just a couple dollars for - I would have rather given them away to a friend. If you could deny the amount they propose for accepted items and get your clothing back, that would be different. Definitely read the details - I clearly should have read more closely. I’ll stick to Poshmark for selling my nice clothing.",1
1487,"Best Online 2nd Hand Store: I’ve been a customer for awhile now and I’m consistently impressed by how well the site is organized, how seamlessly everything works. 

The quality of the items I’ve purchased is exactly as described. Any returns (I personally only buy items that are returnable and not final sale) are easy and they apply credit as soon as the item is en route.

Everything is clean and easy to navigate. I love it!",5
1488,"Slow and disappointing: I love the concept of ThredUP, but they are incredibly slow and give a low payout. Getting your conscription bag takes up to two weeks. It is a nice sized bag and great for a good closet clean out. It is pretty easy to get your bag sent back as well. Then it’s a long waiting game. It takes almost a month for them to even process your bag. Once they finally process, your funds are not available for another two weeks...but don’t worry, you can use them right away if you take the store credit. It wasn’t a terrible experience, but not worth going through again. Next time I’ll just go to a brick and mortar conscription store.",2
1489,"don’t do it: honestly, just go to a thrift store. the items aren’t as described. when i first started issuing this site years ago it was phenomenal. customer service was easily accessible, returns were easy, products were described accurately. Now, it is HORRENDOUS. the interface is terrible, it is impossible to chat or call . The return process is handled differently on a case-by-case basis. When you speak with different people they will talk in circles and not assist you at all. the amount of money you will spend to get items that are damaged is insane. just avoid the company all together and find another sustainable company or thrift store that you can trust.",1
1490,"Exceptional products, frustrating website: Hands down the BEST prices, fastest delivery, and never had a problem with anything I’ve ordered/received. Only complaint I have is that the website is extremely frustrating to navigate and not user-friendly. Have had my entire cart returned after adding items 5mins before - but if you can get thru the site glitches and place an order, everything else is on-point!  Love all my items!",4
1491,"Customer service is nonexistent: The address my order has been shipped to is incorrect. I tried to adjust it immediately in the app, but there was no way to change it, so I immediately reached out to customer service. It was all automated bots and only offered an email option. Hoping I’d reach a human, I sent an email. All of this was done within minutes of my order being placed. The request for a cancellation due to the incorrect shipping address was unfulfilled and now the order is in the mail 4 days later! Terrible experience. I will not be recommending or using this app again. I welcome a human from thredUP to reach out to me and rectify their error.",1
1492,"Bargain shopper here!: I joined ThredUp years ago. I have always shopped thrift and I love how they package my orders, with care.  I have gotten many great items, but they make it very easy to send items back, as well.
My only issue was when I sent items of my own, to sell. I heard nothing about whether anything was sold, nor did anything get sent back to me.
I recommend ThredUp all the time and I have had good experience with their customer svc.",5
1493,"Returning things is a nightmare: All I wanted to do was return items that looked like clown clothing on me. They were so huge on me that I looked silly. So, I cancelled my account because I didn’t care for the “Restocking Fee” and the hoops I jumped through to just get ahold of a HUMAN BEING in customer service/support.
I feel like I’m being punished or given the cold shoulder by ThredUP because I cancelled my account AND wanted to return clothing that would never fit me.
This is so disappointing and upsetting. The entire reason I used this service was because I am too overstimulated and stressed and overwhelmed to buy clothing in a shop. Now, I’m overwhelmed and stressed, just by the return & cancellation process. 
😞",1
1494,"Long Time Customer No More: I have been using ThredUP for at least 6 years now and I’ve become more and more disappointed over the years. I understand the economy and the inflation that has come with that but the huge increase of the shipping price, the outrageous length of the cleanup bags being processed (and the painfully small payout amounts) along with the restructuring of the rewards has led me to go elsewhere for my shopping and my consignment. I gave it two stars instead of zero because the customer service team is ALWAYS responsive and friendly and they do deserve credit for doing a good job.",2
1495,"Amazing!! … just watch out for warehouse locations: I love this app, ThredUP is doing a great job keeping prices low and keeping inventory high. You can find literally anything your heart desires!! ….Just watch out for ordering items from multiple warehouse locations, it will take at least double the usual shipping time while they “consolidate” your order. They don’t warn you in the checkout process, so make sure to look at the description area of each item and you’ll be fine.",4
1496,Petite sophisticate: Good website for used clothes. Good prices. However hard to reach if you have an issue and takes months to process your clothes once they get them. Very little payout on your clothes you send them. Was going to donate my clothes anyway so doesn’t really matter what the payout is for me. I will continue to use three up and have recommended to friends as well. I got a great outfit for nephews wedding where I couldn’t find anything in stores and at a great price. Thanks Thred Up!,4
1497,"ThredUP favorite shopping but needs a few updates: This is my favorite place to shop for clothing. That said, the app could be better. Tough to to filter shoes and other categories, also no way to stack filters within a saved search, for instance to look for sandals that are new with tags within a saved search. Also difficult to discover new brands, create saved searches for specific brands, and add new brands to a saved search. Would appreciate easier way to do this both online and mobile.",4
1498,"Buying vs Selling: If you’re looking to let go of clothes and don’t care if you get any money for them, then it’s an easy place to donate them. Buying items is probably the best bet because it’s online thrifting, BUT for a thrift store it’s pricey. Why I’m giving thredUP 1 star is because they absolutely rip you off. If I could add images of what I sent in and what I got for ALL of my gently used items I would. I ended up with $9. Some of my items expired so I’m having them shipped back which is $6. I made $3 on the 12 items I sent in which is laughable. There’s also been numerous posts on other social platforms of people missing items because they got lost. Their customer service team is also a joke.",1
1499,"Biggest Rip-off in history!: Dear Thread-Up, 
You make your money dishonestly. I will pay $5.99 to ship my stuff back just so you don’t get the glory of having it. I ordered a Coach wristlet that said Made in China in the tag, it was a fake. You charge outrageous shipping and sell my things for a high price while I get $2.00 when I can go to the local consignment store and get a fair price. You claim you recycle and I have yet to believe that. Which if you do, I’m sure you make a huge profit off of that. You take people who are desperate for money while you are sipping a martini in your Los Angeles penthouse. If you were a fair company, I may give you a good rating, however you don’t care about the planet. You care about making a buck.",1
1500,"This app is amazing: ThredUP is amazing and the best online store to shop at. Not only are the prices astonishingly cheaper; but it’s clear that when you get there package they’re looking out for the environment! The prices may be cheep but the clothes are in brand new and great condition. I have definitely found amazing things off thredUP. Even when you don’t like something the return policy is so easy. I suggest you shopping at thredUP not only to be a style icon, buy to save money and the environment.",5
1501,"Best shopping app EVER!: I’m a huge lover of buying used clothes, thrift and consignment stores are my go to shopping places in person, but I’ve never found a used clothing app or online store until I finally gave thredUP a chance! The app is amazing! I love that I can favorite items, hold something in my cart for a certain amount of hours, bundle items so that I can get free shipping, AND save searches! Not to mention everything is in amazing condition AND brands you can’t find at thrift stores. BIG FAN HERE!",5
1502,"Fun Fashion Hunt: While I don’t love that I’m charged a restocking fee on some returns (after all, I don’t pay to return something to a store...and, HOW do I know how a brand or a style fits without trying it on?), I DO love having pictures of my specific fashion requests (in my sizes) show up in my inbox for my perusal every night at 5:02.  It’s fun to have a fast fashion safari before dinner!

I love finding things I’ll proudly wear at a great prices - and it feels like a celebration when my selections show up in my mailbox.",5
1503,"Don’t waste your time!: With all of the many options of places to sell used clothing, ThreadUp should be your last. I was told how great they were and saved all of my higher priced items to send in, while keeping my lower end items to sell on my own elsewhere. I made a total of $5 on over $150 worth of clothing. Not okay, not worth it! On other apps (that I need to take my own pictures on) I was getting over $5 an item... WAY more than $5 an item. Apparently they recently changed their payout system and so now they screw over all their customers. And don’t bother looking for customer service, because they only offer automated and it’s difficult to get an actual human to interact with.",1
1504,"It’s ok: I sent them a bag of full of nice clothes and shoes, some of them were unused and clothes still with tags, and they paid me around $1.00 for each item, later to be sold for at least $20, I know I wasn’t goin to be using it anyway, but the profit they make of your items is ridiculous. 
Also to be a thrift store it is way too expensive, I didn’t buy anything yet, I find better deals on my local thrift store. 
The convenience is nice, but you are an online shopper like me and know how to get deals and rebates for your purchases, you actually paying same prices as brand new.",3
1505,The GOAT of bargains: I have so many high end products that people LOVEE - I can’t believe I didn’t find this site sooner. The rush is real! You definitely have to be patient and have alerts ready for certain brands and items. I’m extremely happy with this company.  There are only a few items I was not happy with. Remember IF ITEM NOT AS PICTURED or described YOU WILL get a refund.  Happy haunting -BOO!   For real a great site. The rewards and points make it very worthwhile. Love it.,5
1506,"Overall Bad Experience: I like the idea, but the execution is terrible.

If you purchase something and it doesn’t fit, it’s a $9 shipping fee just to return the item, on top of a $4 “restocking fee”. 

The promotions never work on desirable items, only stuff that’s been sitting on the website for weeks because of quality issues or being out of style. 

Many of the items listed are close to what they would cost at a traditional retailer brand new.

They’ve canceled multiple orders of mine for having different accounts of family members at the same address despite having different payment information, with no way tip re-order (your purchased items are reposted and sold to someone else).

They don’t have a customer service number so you have to go through their “live chat” option if you want to speak to a living person you have to jump through hoops. 

Very bad experience overall. Wouldn’t recommend, just go to goodwill or your local thrift store.",1
1507,"Order never received: Order was delivered to Thred Up in Suwanee, not to my address. I am getting no response to my chat and email inquiries over last 2 days.

Update:  After several attempts to contact customer support, I received an email response and assistance getting my item reshipped.  It took over 3 weeks from the order date but I received the item, am pleased with it, and appreciate the kind assistance.",5
1508,"Wow!: I just received my first ThredUP order! Wow. For being thrifty and buying secondhand you wouldn’t know it! My order arrived in a polka dotted box, packed and wrapped in lovely tissue paper also polka dotted. Each piece (3 shirts, a skirt, and a cardigan) was folded neatly and honestly looked brand new. This arrived looking fancier than anything fancy I ever bought. Plus shipping was faster than I thought it would be. I have found my new shopping addiction. 5 plus plus stars for you!",5
1509,"So easy to see so many options: I love  the opportunity to shop from home and look at the items that I have and what a s available to see if they will work together.  I have convinced many of my friends and family to try it and they are hooked!  Also love that I am giving new life to clothing with plenty of life left in it!   Thanks for this wonderful option,  could not be easier…..",5
1510,"Loving TREDUP: I love this site so very much - they have been so very professional to me and the clothes sent - which has made up for the person that has stolen everything to me - which will be in my book that I write of what has happened to me - this person taking advantage of me having stage lVB cancer - and prior to death this is the best thing. -site - that has truly made me enjoy my time left here!  Thank You ThredUP - thank you so very much!
Kindly,

1511,"Wish for lil change: I do understand the cart timer,I have a handicap well more than one but my hand wrist all the way to shoulder hand drawn inn hard with timer ive been with y’all for years there’s a gap list parents brother I got hurt COVID lost more was wondering used to have quite a bit more time does it still that way have to work way up again?we do realy like thredUP but realy need to speak with someone about order try tomorrow  oh used to be able to see items an price even after going to check out not now? Thanks",3
1512,"They steal money from you!: I ordered a lot of outfits for my kids. Once they got here there were a few items that were too big so they needed to be returned. As I am returning these items I realize that the prices listed on the return page are WAY lower then when I purchased them. Plus now I have to pay 1.99 for each item that I’m returning which is not my concern because I knew that. So I take screenshots and then contact their customer service, tell them everything and sent the screenshots to prove my point. Their response was, “there is nothing I can do, sorry for the inconvenience”. Then ended the chat so I could no longer reply.",1
1513,Love this app: It’s one of those you check in with daily to see what kind of deals and items they have. Love the fact that items stay in your cart for 12 hours because sometimes you need to think about it or saw it and just couldn’t finish the transaction immediately. Plus I love being able to trade in clothes I’m no longer wearing that are in good condition and get paid for them.,5
1514,"Great stuff but sloooooooow shipping: I LOVE Thredup! Been happy with everything I purchased through the app. I’d give 5 stars if not for the shipping. Why ANY company chooses Fedex to ship their products is beyond me. It takes ages to arrive, and if it actually does arrive at my house (they often deliver to my neighbor’s house) the box is pretty beat up. One glance at the tracking can often explain that because the package often travels back and forth across state lines several times before it actually arrives. THREDUP - Change your shipping provider and I’ll up the stars!!",3
1515,absolutely stunning app: I love this app so much i’ve found so many amazing items of clothing. almost everything about it is perfect. the only thing i have a problem with is it take me multiple attempts to enter the correct thing i’m searching for. for example i search up winter hats and it takes me to winter boots like 6 times and sometimes things that have literally no relation to it. that’s really the only problem i have with it otherwise it’s a perfect app! :),4
1516,"Contacting thredUP: This is the absolute worst company to try and contact, I sent 4 messages to try and update my email information so that I could actually get paid and that’s far have had zero luck in doing so not only do they have ridiculously low payouts but when it comes to actually getting paid out it’s nearly impossible I basically have donated three very large bags of clothing to them which they continue to make a lot of money off of I really look to thread up to try to make a few extra dollars during the pandemic instead I feel as though I’ve gotten taken advantage of I hope it doesn’t happen to anyone else",1
1517,"Love it!: ThredUp is amazing. I’ve found so many amazing things on here for great prices! You don’t tend to get much money through cleanout kits, but that really isn’t a big deal with me. I have found what I think is a bug. Photos for certain items seem to be glitching, if not it’s probably careless employees. I found listings that have photos of blank mannequins, and others that have two front or two back photos. It’s kind of annoying, so I would like to see that fixed.",4
1518,"Love this app, minor complaints: I love this app and it has become my favorite way to shop secondhand. I do wish that they sizes were marked correctly, especially on pants. A description will say that the waist is a certain inch size and when you click on it, it shows a different number. I also wish they would either increase their pay for clothes sent in or not do it at all. It’s crazy that I send in like 10 items and only make $15. I love the app so much, but I wish they would work on these things!",4
1519,"What a rip off: Don’t sell through thred up. It is highway robbery how much they take. I gave them designer clothes with labels and tags still attached. Brand new. The latest fashion. Free people, Killstar, dolls kill, trip NYC, all brand new, all with tags. They took it all. They sold (according to them) only a few items worth selling and gave me $7.27. Don’t ever ever ever give them your clothes to sell.

Don’t ever buy from thred up. They don’t give you the measurements correctly, you never know what you’re getting. They constantly give the wrong size in their descriptions. They’re overpriced and they take a huge cut. The original seller hardly gets anything.

When I FINALLY reached a live person to talk to about my clothes they were selling, they pointed out to me the microscopic fine print where it is stated that they will “give away” the clothes they don’t use unless I pay them a certain amount. 

I would have made at least ten times as much if I would have sold my stuff on poshmark or mercari. Lesson learned!!",1
1520,"cheap sustainable shopping!: summary: 
- you can pay using venmo! 
- comes very fast
- excellent quality 
- very well and cutely packaged 
- app is user friendly 
i honestly can’t believe how great this app is. normally i love going thrift shopping but obviously that’s not possible right now during quarantine so i decided to give this app a try. i ordered three sweaters and a big fluffy coat for $30, with the full expectation that i wouldn’t like some of them when they arrived. first of all, they arrived within one week of ordering and every single one was in amazing shape! i feel like each of the sweaters could have easily had a $30 price tag, and much more for the coat. Instead i paid $30 TOTAL and am absolutely in love with everything i got. 
I give thredup a 10/10! 
Do yourself a favor and download this app now :)",5
1521,"Horrible: Buyer beware clothing looks nothing like pictures, clearly using very good cameras and good lighting.  Most items, even high dollar items,  have fuzz balls and colors are drab and some have horrible old odors and look no where near what they show on site AND you have to pay to ship this junk. I’ve purchased a few times and even consigned and on the consignment end you get nothing for your clothes and on the buying end you get mostly garage sale clothes at best cleverly disguised under good lighting and cameras. My experience is one out of every 15 items is worth a keep depending on the price. 

Save yourself the shipping fees, I’m officially done with this site !!",1
1522,"Great Experience!: I just recently started to purchase from thredUP and I have nothing but great things to say! All the items I’ve purchased were exactly as posted, from condition to size. Nothing is more exciting than opening my front door to see my fav polka dot box(es)!  

In a short time I’ve become totally addicted to thredUP!!! Ordered some great dresses for my son’s wedding and the associated events...corresponding purses, etc. I have not had one bad purchase!",5
1523,"Nothing But Good Experiences: I’ve used Thred Up for the majority of my clothing purchases for myself and toddler for a few years now. I’ve had nothing but positive experiences. As you’d expect with an array of brands, sizing is not always predictable but their return process has been a breeze every time. I’ve gotten regular clothes and maternity plus lots and lots of kids clothes.

The only fault I’ve found is my husband is always bummed there’s no mens section so we can buy his clothes there too!",5
1524,Getting worse.: The app hasn’t worked in over two weeks. No app updates. Tech support said to use the website on a computer but then I couldn’t reset my password with the reset link they sent! It’s probably for the best. I’ve received kid’s clothing items twice (once a sweater and once a belt) because they were listed incorrectly under women’s sizes on the app. The shipping cost to return them wasn’t worth it. They need better quality control and better app development.,4
1525,"Love but could greatly improve!: So many site improvements would make shopping much easier; thus, become the #1 shopping site for myself & many others: Entering specific type of product search (kitten heel, sports tee), difficult to bundle separate purchase directions (I've often bought enough $ to have free shipping even though I originally clicked Bundle but it was not automatically given😢), showing more “might like” options...and many more.",4
1526,Best way to shop for clothes EVER: It’s nice that the clothes are secondhand and you’re helping the environment... but what’s AWESOME is this method of shopping.  The clothes are all displayed on clothing forms so you can see how they will look on; you can try them on in your own home on your own time; the measurements are listed (no more hemming pants!) and you can shop peacefully from the couch on Saturday night during the family movie instead of with multiple kids + husband pressuring you to hurry. Love it!,5
1527,"Started Out Strong: My first experience with thread up was fantastic. I found their prices for my items to be reasonable and I was elated to get the items out of my closet vs other platforms which require additional work from me (posting images, negotiating offers, etc). 

However, after sending two more bags of clothes, I’ve seen a significant drop in prices. The items are selling much slower and my earnings for an entire bag of clothes is similar to the cost of three items sold on the other platform I use. Maybe my efforts on this other platform is worth the money!",3
1528,"Don’t sell with them!!!!: They have continuously ‘lost’ all the most expensive items I sent in and this last one takes the cake. My fault for trusting them thinking it’s a coincidence. The customer service doesn’t respond, you never get reimbursed for items they’ve lost and even with the return assurance option they haven’t sent back my most expensive items I’ve sent in. Stick to other platforms, you’ll get pennies or a big fat NOTHING for your stuff on this platform. They steal, lie, cheat and I have no idea why they call long shirts dresses and post pictures of dresses backwards, inside out misrepresenting items people try to sell. I hope this company gets their karma for their scamming ways.",1
1529,"Restocking fee will discourage me from buying again: I used ThredUP frequently a couple of years ago and was pretty happy with the experience.  I just ordered five items a couple of weeks ago and this was my first order since they added a $1.99 per item restocking fee.  Out of the five pieces, three don’t fit (one item is hung up in delivery somewhere) and are being returned, so I’m losing at least $6 on the deal. These were brands I’m somewhat familiar with, so I definitely won’t try any new brands (like I used to) because I don’t want to pay the restocking fee if they don’t work out.",3
1530,"5 Stars for Great Prices & Even Better Customer Service: So first off I love how easy it is to use ThredUp! The prices are always a steal and the clothes have always come quickly and in good condition. 
My one slight negative is that 2 of the pants I ordered came as petite when the description didn’t state that they were petite. I immediately contacted ThreadUp, and they refunded my money for the 2 pairs. They were pleasant and I really appreciate good customer service. This ensures I will continue to be a customer of ThredUp!",5
1531,Too expensive for used clothing: I have purchased a few things through thread up. I have noticed several items are out dated and they are charging to much for these items. Example: A dress I bought at Target on sale 10 years ago shouldn’t be selling for almost what I paid for it.  I also know that when you sell things through this company they hardly give you any money for them but yet they charge an awful lot for something used. I think I made a total of 8 dollars on a bag full of Name brand up to date clothing and shoes. I believe most of my items sold and $8 in store credit is what I made off of it.,2
1532,"Convenient: It seems that consignment and Goodwill shopping have gotten so popular in the last decade and their prices have followed the fade with increased pricing (compared to approx 10-15 years ago). Just a suggestion, I’m sure most of us shopping for used clothes are like minded and love a deal. However, if you are able to keep your costs the same and in some cases maybe even lower, perhaps having the option of a stylist would be a great addition to your website. Thanks for creating an app that allows me to skip the brick and mortar stores and spend more time in the garden.",3
1533,"Disappointed: I have been using thred up and liked it at first. However, I purchased a “designer” purse that said it was in excellent condition and got it only to find it is in TERRIBLE condition and missing its straps, I immediately tried to contact customer service, no response. There is no contact number or email that is made available on the app. If the situation isn’t rectified, I really would not be a returning customer nor would I recommend anyone to thredup.
Very disappointed!!",5
1534,Absolutely love this app!!!!!!: GREAT app!!! I love that instead of having to buy each item you want from a different person and paying shipping for each individual item here you have an amazing variety to choose from and shipping is either free(depending on how much you spend) or less than you are charged on most sites. Every item I have received has looked as though it’s new and it only takes a few days to get your order!!!! LOVE this app!!!,5
1535,"Okay: I bought some clothes from them about a year ago and everything came as advertised. But a couple months ago a mailed in twenty-six articles of clothing and only got eight dollars in credit. I didn’t send in cheap clothes either, everything was name brand. The site has an option to get your clothes sent back to you if they didn’t put it up on the sight. They received my clothing in February and now we’re in July and I haven’t gotten anything back.",5
1536,Give it a shot: So far my experience with the app has been favorable. I feel like there should be a limit to how long someone can keep something in their cart...and maybe the seasoned shoppers have worked a way around that. It disappointing to see one of my favorite items sit “unavailable” for days and days because a shopper hasn’t made a decision to purchase. I anxiously await my first purchased items to arrive. Hopefully I won’t want to change this review.,5
1537,"Do not sell items!!!!: Please do not sell your items to thredUp. I sent in a bag of clothing. Seven (7!!!) items were accepted for resale - and you know how much money I got? $2.08! 

Let me repeat that so it sinks in. $2.08 for seven pieces of clothing which included a business jacket, name brand dress pants, and several name brand dresses. 

This enterprise borders on criminal. I am going to write similar reviews on other websites so that I can alert more folks. This resale is a total scam. Please please please either give your clothes to charity and take the write off, or go to another consignment site.",4
1538,"Initially great, recently slow and unresponsive: I was initially very happy with the service at ThredUP theough the app and the delivery was quick and often faster than other online stores, however since November everything has been extremely slow including responsiveness from customer support and shipping. I’ve mentioned it in many notes with no resolution or offer of compensation for terrible service. I loved this store and am extremely disappointed!",5
1539,They stole my stuff: I’ve been a frequently customer since 2018 and decided to send a bag in despite the fact that they now charge a whopping $15 fee to process the back and they barely pay you anything for your clothes so it’s highly likely that the fee will not even cover the cost of the clothes. I can’t believe what they did. I sent a new with tags close that are very popular brands on ThredUp and they did not list them. They are definitely going to sell them because I know that those brand sell instantly on their platform and the stuff that I sent and was new tags. At least with Plato’s closet you can get your stuff back.,1
1540,This site is awesome!: I love this site. The way the clothes come packaged and fast delivery. The clothes themselves are like new and some still have the tags on them. Everything I have gotten off this site has been beautiful. I received so many compliments when I wear the outfits. Keep up the great work with this site. The only thing that I think maybe would be nicer is more buck for the clothes you sell. That’s all. 👍,5
1541,"Wish I’d known: I think it’s great that they’re trying to help the environment stellar idea, in creating an online thrift store on consignment. 
However my  issue is  with the amount of payout compared to how much they charge you if an item doesn’t sell and you want it mailed back to you. Overly excessive amount in my opinion. Additionally if it’s too expensive to buy back they end up keeping it and probably sell it past the date that your able to purchase it back and still make a nice profit while  you receive nothing. I personally wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.",2
1542,"I literally can't...: i cannot express how much i LOVE this app there's always new items to choose from and everything i have gotten has been perfect minus one shirt and a pair of pants that was too small, but since then i learned to look at the measurements carefully and everything has been beautiful i am so happy i started using this app i am not one to leave reviews on apps but this one deserves all the praise!! well done!!",5
1543,"App is fine. Company is not.: The app works quite well, has all the functionality of their normal site. HOWEVER, their actual business practice doesn’t seem to include measuring or sizing the clothes at all. Out of five items in my first order, five items were incorrect on every listed measurement. It’s clear that absolutely no one actually checked the size for any of them, and somehow only two were returnable and only for store credit to buy more randomly-sized clothing. 

So I’m out $75 and don’t have any shorts. 

If you feel like playing the size lottery, that’s up to you. If you prefer clothes that fit, go literally anywhere else.",1
1544,"GREAT, RECOMMEND! But I would improve one thing: I love thredUP it is so cool! It is easy and the clothes are always good quality! I love everything about it except the only one thing I REALLLY want them to change, pleaseee get better mannequins or a model to try on the clothes. I hate the current mannequin they have it makes the clothes look super unflattering and it’s hard to see how they would fit. But other than that I highly recommend!!",5
1545,"Sellers Beware: I love the company’s concept and have sold with them before, but I believe they have outgrown their ability to keep up. I sent a closet clean out in late July, which Thred Up acknowledged receipt of on August 4th. Here we are 12 weeks later and it still has not been processed. By the time my clean out of winter clothes is processed, it will be spring and my items won’t be worth anything. I have tried to reach out using the app as well as email, but got no response. Very frustrating!! If you are looking to make some quick cash for your gently used items, this is not the place!!",2
1546,"So helpful and satisfying!: Like others have said, this is how I shop for clothes now. I have a hard-to-fit body and having measurements for each garment that I can filter for is awesome. 
I give this 5 stars, but if you wanted to be a super 5 star app I do have a suggestion: folders within the favorites area so that I can keep stuff I might want for my toddler separate from the stuff for my older child and myself.  Thanks!",5
1547,"Ehh: It’s a hit or miss.. be sure to read the description (unless it says new with tags or you wouldn’t know it was used, I don’t recommend buying) if it says there’s a flaw of any kind, don’t buy it unless you can live with it.. I bought sunglasses and the ear piece was chewed up and it was uncomfortable to wear (they took pics where the that side wasn’t shown.) bought some shirts that said minor wear or stain and there was a bleach stain on the front. ALWAYS zoom in on the pics and look for the flaws otherwise, you’ll be disappointed when it arrives, if it arrives when it says it’s supposed to.",2
1548,"Absolutely awesome: This place is absolutely amazing, I bought not only from here, but also from Nike, ADIDAS, Abercrombie and Fitch, and of course Hollister. The ones from the other places (Nike and ASIA’S), where be, but the 3 outfits I received from thredUP are amazing, soft, burned in, and extremely cheap! I was shoved with the quality! These outfits I purchased from threadup would of been around $500, for the Hollister and Abercrombie, but it was actually under $100, and it’s perfect!!!",5
1549,"Good app but problematic descriptions and deliveries: Long time user of ThredUP. Item descriptions are becoming increasingly inaccurate and it’s terribly frustrating to continue receiving items identified as “women’s” actually being children’s. Additionally, the quality control process seems to be declining. I used to be able to count on the accuracy of “NWT” and “like new” but have gotten several items now that actually have gaping holes or stains. Something is happening to ThredUP, and it’s not good. I love second hand shipping, but if these trend continue, I’ll just go back to the thrift stores. It’s faster and more reliable.",2
1550,Can’t stop shopping!: It’s truly the world’s biggest thrift shop. I started using thread up as a way to recycle unwanted clothes responsibly. After pregnancy I realized none of my clothes fit me the same so I’m now using thred up to trade my old wardrobe for a new one while purchasing less and enjoying pre-loved clothing I would otherwise purchase new. I can’t stop checking out the app because it makes it so easy to browse.,5
1551,"Used to be 5 star: I used to use Thred up a lot more than I do now because they use to be really fast with their turn around times.  Not sure what is slowing them down on processing bags because when I buy something, I get it right away.  If they caught up on processing bags, I would clean out closets again and start using them more.  Still love the clothes though, I can honestly say it’s the only thing in my closet.",5
1552,"iPad App keeps getting messed up: The app is fine when its working right, but lately on the iPad its showing the iPhone version of the app and is super distorted because its for the wrong screen size. You also have to be super careful when it comes to the measurements they provide for items! Sometimes they are so far off they’re half the size and then you have to pay two dollars to return each item that they incorrectly measured. Overall it’s a great idea and they have great stuff, you just have to be cautious.",3
1553,"Repeat Buyer - Refresh your wardrobe on a budget: I absolutely love ThredUP and what it offers: quality pre-owned merchandise at your fingertips 
It’s eco minded with the bundle options, and the packaging is nice too. It’s a fun experience to open up the box and see the new treasures. Customer service has been responsive when 2-3 items (in 4-5 years) were not as described. One was a size mislabel, one maternity, and one item in poor condition. I’d say, the success rate for this avid thrifter is near perfect. Thanks ThredUP!",5
1554,"Item description ISSUE: The app is fine, but they have a HUGE problem with their descriptions on the items they sell. I’m writing this in hopes that an actual change for the better happens. 

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve purchased something that has been described as “excellent condition”, but then when my purchase arrives there are noticeable issues, such as rips, stains, fading, etc. I’ve also received several clothing items that were labeled as petite on the app, but were NOT actually a petite size. 

I have been able to score some pretty great deals, but at this point I always feel like my order is a crap-shoot. I just expect there to be a problem with an item (or items) that I ordered. 

Their customer service is good however, since they don’t charge you for a return if the description is inaccurate, but it’s SUCH a bummer to be disappointed.  

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ThredUp, item description needs to be accurate!! 

I’m afraid that I might have to delete the app so as to not cause myself further disappointment...",1
1555,"All Good Experiences: I have both shopped thred up and sent in my clothes for consignment to thred up. I have had all good experiences with both. It is so easy to send in clothes I’m cleaning out of my closet. I do no work and end up making money. I was surprised at how little they actually accepted of what I sent in. That was disappointing. But hey, I’m still making easy money from what they do sell. From a buying standpoint, I have been happy with everything I’ve gotten. All good quality, clean, no problems. This site has been a great discovery!",4
1556,"SELLERS BEWARE: I sent 2 bags back in MAY  one was so proceeds could go to charity the other to sell for me. According to the app one back is still in transit and the other has been revived but not gone through!!! I understand quarintine has slowed stuff down but it shouldn’t take almost 7 MONTHS to receive a bag go through it and post the items especially since I get notifications  daily that there are “hot new items” 
Please note that I have sent them 3 bags prior 2 I got money for and 1 bag they said they couldn’t sell anything which was weird to me but okay. Do your research and maybe go through a different company or sell your stuff on Poshmark or curtsy yourself so you have more control.",1
1557,"Long time ThredUpper: I LOVE this app and the overall site. I’ve been using for a few years now and will always come back to it. My only issue is as they’ve gotten bigger they’ve definitely changed a few things. The restocking fee, not listing measurements for every item. Things that can easily be adjusted to but still. I also wish we could sort items by measurement, or specific size per brand since every brand is different. Overall I do recommend ThredUP and will always be a fan!",4
1558,"Late shipment: I’ve used ThredUP in the past and been pleased; however, I’m disappointed with my recent order. I ordered one of their “Goody Boxes” and the online receipt said it would ship in 7-10 days. Mine didn’t ship for 17 days! I contacted them day 16 to check on it and was told it was being packed and should ship out in the next 24 hours. I thought it would be nice to a least get an apology for the delay, but I was just told the facts w/ no acknowledgement that this was out of the norm. I may try ordering from them one more time, but if still encounter such a delay will not continue.",3
1559,"Horrible and Do not trust: They received my bag of items and I got a notification - little note on the app after 3-4 weeks of waiting( NOT by EMAIL) that I need to call customer service... 
I did and I am told that my bag was received but they can no Longer find it and here is $35... my clothes were DESIGNER because I needed emergency money to sell...brand new! 
Now they are telling me- give us exact description of all items and we will look into this.. 
how the heck do they lose my bag - the one that has brand new designer clothes and not the junk that no one wants? 
I do not have time to think through every item I included- however I will watch all that they post and if I see my guess, lulu, Vince, Melani- brand new clothes and shoes I will keep letting them know. 
Do not send your good clothes in hope that you get paid, you will only get $35 if they are truly great clothes. If they are so-so, you will probably get them back and end up paying $10 to ship them back.
Be aware of this before you part with anything somewhat valuable.",1
1560,"1st order: 1 of 2 packages didn't get delivered and can’t get ahold of anyone to get some help! SO DISAPPOINTED! When I finally got a person via chat (of course you can’t SPEAK to anyone) and reported it , the customer service lady Christine said that the carrier said it was delivered, insinuating I did something with the item! MY ITEM WAS NEVER DELIVERED! They said they are refunding the money and giving me a 20% off my next purchase, I am not sure I will order again! EBay is where I will continue to shop!",5
1561,"Love thrift store shopping from the comfort of my home: Love the store. Just finished my first cycle. Purchase, try on , keep some, return some. Easy! First. This model works because we can return!!! Love that. The app was easy, intuitive and fun. Even gave me initiative to use it more and look more (coupon for another order). I will be coming back. By the way... offering free shipping for returns if i accept a credit is brilliant! Keep me coming back because I hate paying for shipping.",5
1562,"Like to Buy, Hate to sell.: They have some good stuff and good sales. I also like the goody boxes. I had one instance where my goody box was stolen off my porch and they were great with customer service. I also really like the bag they send to sell your stuff. That being said, I curated my clothes to send to them so well that they didn’t reject anything.... some athleisure, mid-designer accessories, and some higher end items. I sent them $1000 worth of clothes that they sold for $300 and I got $3. It also took a month for them to even list anything. I know they have to be profitable but...  Never. Again.",3
1563,"Awesome app, awesome company: The app is super easy to use and the filters for size, color, style, brand, etc. are all spot on. I almost always have a coupon to use and the shipping is super speedy. I’ve ordered 6 times, and usually return about 1/3 of the stuff — not unlike trying clothing on at a store — and returns are dead easy. I always return for store credit and get free return shipping, making things super simple. Condition has always matched description exactly. Huge fan!",5
1564,"Loved: I do love this app! It’s pretty awesome to get prices this nice. The only thing I don’t like is, 
when you heart items and add to your cart then you go to check out and it’s unavailable or whatever. Why couldn’t it have told me that before I went to check out? I found something so cute and that was really the main thing I wanted but due to it being unavailable I couldn’t get it or find one like it.
I would recommend that when you click on the item it will tell you right away if it’s not available.",4
1565,"Seller beware: The first thing I did with this app is try to sell clothes. I sent in three of their clean out bags. I filled each one with clothes. First, it took forever for them to be shipped out then, then it also took forever for the bags to be processed and even longer for my items to actually be received. This all took about four months and the initial payout was about $1. I had items with tags still on and some that were close to new. Some other items didn’t even show up in the listings. But after all of this, it’s been about a month and all I’ve gotten is $22. In my opinion, I would rather donate my clothes to a local charity where I know the clothes will be put to good use.",1
1566,"AMAZING!: I just bought 3 brand new bathing suits, 2 cover ups, 2 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of jeans, flip flops and boots all for under $200, WITH free shipping. I did it from my couch, relaxed and with a glass of wine. This is by far the best clothing shopping experience I've ever had and will not be going back to those awful stores with obnoxious music and horrible overhead lighting. Thank you ThredUP for making thrift shopping easy and fun! Reusing clothes is one HUGE way we can all make a difference to help save this planet and it's people.",5
1567,"U NEED THIS RN!!!!: If you are like me, who likes thrift shopping, but does not always have the opportunity to shop in a store or finds something really cute in person but it is not your size, you need to buy this app!!! With this app, you can buy as many clothes as you desire, and have the opportunity to do it at the comfort of your own home!!! ALSO, YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING, AND IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH YOUR PURCHASE, RETURN IT TO GET THRIFT CREDITS TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE OR YOUR MONEY BACK!!! What is there not to love?",5
1568,"Buy don’t Sell: I sent a 5 piece Vera set with tags on some pieces and one piece was a Grand Traveler ... my payout was LESS than $40 ... and each and every piece including the Coach pieces I sent with it sold in less than a week. I sent in this same order two MK purses ... got MAYBE $30 for them and they each sold for more than double. Clothing items I was offered FIFTY CENTS for sold for $10 on the site. 

They’re worse than a greedy pawn shop on the selling end. The fees are also exorbitant. The app is user friendly and the selling prices are okay ... but I wouldn’t recommend that anyone sell to them.",3
1569,"My new go-to shopping app!: I have found such gems shopping on thred up and I really appreciate the way everything is packaged and shipped. I really like the picture search function and the saved searches option! 

My only qualm is with the measurements on some items, there’ll be 40” waists on sizes smalls and that makes me question the accuracy of some of the items. So far so good though and I know the volume of clothing they have is insane so I totally understand.",4
1570,"Total scam!: I sent in a bag full of name brands - some with tags still on items - and received 50 points as my payout! Ridiculous! Will never use this company again. Zero customer service either! On top of that, I received an email two weeks later from thredUP asking me to email yet another department to get more information on my status. Receiving emails does not solve the problem! Again, scam!",5
1571,"App needs work: I love to thrift but my god. Shopping in here is SO frustrating that it took me almost a year to really dedicate myself to looking through each item. Please do a better job at writing descriptive key words that we can search and find clothing better! I use the filtering aspect but it’s too broad still. Even better, please allow us the option to upload a photo and allow the app to search the website for similar matches. That would make this shopping experience so much easier.",3
1572,"Great app!! But have recommendations!: I love this app and access to great discounts on clothes! I love being able to filter by condition as well. Currently the app has some glitches where you cannot click back in some pages. Also, I think it’d be great to be able to filter through your likes so you can see specific things and if they were discounted more etc!

I wish they kept the “Premium clothing” tab so you could shop from premium brands.",4
1573,"Some gems, some garbage: I have had a really mixed experience with thred up. The quality is mixed but as long as you review each item thoroughly prior to your purchase, you will probably be in the clear. Some other issues have been sizing- and that is hardly the fault of the company but rather the expected variation in sizimg between brands and typical shrinkage with certain fabrics. Overall I’m a fan of this service and many of my most valued clothing has come from here",4
1574,"Not the best but not the worst: I have been using this app for a long time now. I have received only a few orders from them. 
Pros👇
Great variety of brands and items
Price points seem to be good 
App is easy to navigate 
Cons👇
Restocking Fees, if you are returning items 
Return credit 3-4 weeks
Only 2 pictures of items 
Not very good descriptions of items. Even incorrect descriptions of items 
Customer service not the best
Have to do extra work to look up item for better pictures and description 
Some items on app look like they dug it out of a trash can. Especially some of the thrifted shoes on there. It’s weird how you will be denied them taking your perfectly in great condition clothing, but then witness some items on their app in worse state. But their policy states otherwise 
If you have questions or concerns it takes them about a week to get back to you",3
1575,"Mostly lemons and bad service: Update I found out that 2 more items had hole! 3 items with stains ,2 with holes , threadup don’t get back to you when you complain . They don’t accept this stuff when buying so I don’t understand why they think it’s ok to send damaged clothes to paying customers. It’s become a culture of accepting crappy service and goods while YouTubers chuckle about it casually like this ok.
Still no contact about that awful box,i even bought another box but could not track it on the app because the app shows that I have no purchases . So I wonder what those two boxes were ? Gifts? I waisted my money on them Thats no gift.",1
1576,"Need a few extras…: I love the viewing thread but I wish there were a way to toggle my favorite brands and simply look for items within those brands along with my sizes. I’m not a part girl so I’m not looking for those kinds of tops when I look at tops. I’m usually looking for business dress pieces - which is why I’d love to be able to search within my favorite brands that I know will bring it. 

I also wear a medium in regular sizes, but a petite large in petites. I desperately need to be able to set different sizes between petites and regulars. A 10 regular is typically a 12 petite.  I need to be able to see both sizes.",2
1577,Customer for life!: I don’t even know where to start with this review. The ease of use in the app is a plus. However I would like to see a change in the results for specific searches of items when queried. The item descriptions for clothing include measurements that make clothing buying a success; no more returns due to ill-fitted clothes with the disappointment that follows. I hope this review helps someone give a try!,5
1578,"You won’t regret it!: I had seen this app, heard about it, I’ve seen unboxings and I’ve read other reviews. But the items you get from here are nothing short of amazing! The first Oder I made and received were items that I’m pretty sure we’re/ are new or never used!pretty hard to believe it’s thrifted ! But even better knowing they were! New to the app? Sign up and get up to %50 off your first order + free shipping! ITS WORTH IT !!",5
1579,"ThredUP was great, now is terrible: I have been a customer since they started.  They were amazing, great prices and customer service was spot on - but they have CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

The customer service is non-existent, no phone number just email that takes 5 or more days with a blanket response, or by chat - but if it’s not closed, no chat person responds during regular hours!! Literally waited 12 hours still no response.

They RAISED their prices and rip off people who consign with them with extra hidden fees. If you want your unsold items returned, you pay over $10 for each time they send something back!

If you have to return anything, good luck.  Even when they sent the entirely wrong thing, they still attempted to charge a Restocking Fee AND tried to refund me a lesser amount.  PLUS they charge for postage even when it is their mistake because it’s impossible to reach anyone to explain the issue.

ThredUP is a complete rip off now.  Disappointing.  Need to start a competitor company.",1
1580,"Apps need improvement: Apps need improvement on synchronizing account updates. I changed shipping address in apps and after that, I placed order. My order was shipped to old ( wrong) address after all. It was disappointment. I didn’t receive my order and didn’t received refund. I will not recommend use this app in case if you need change address, it will not synchronize with guys in wear-house.",5
1581,Amazing THRED UP: I found thredUP years ago & honestly I’m so happy I did their amazing easy to search categories wonderful prices & their merchandise is Amazingly Wonderful I’ve also ordered order kits to send my clothing & shoes I no longer wanted & they sold it for me on thredUP & I received credit to my account to purchase new items & it’s awesome I just love this It’s improving even they were perfect to me before. You must try it’s great. Momma2000,5

Fashion for me is all about mixing classic staples with fun and unique pieces, and I am all about the thrill of of the search and finding a good deal. ThredUP is like a treasure hunt, and I have been able to curate items that suit my own personal style without breaking the bank! Plus BONUS, buying up-cycled clothing helps the planet :) Its truly a win/win and I am a very happy customer! Thanks ThredUP!",5
1583,"Terrible Service: The app works fine; however, Thredup has gone downhill. In the past, I purchased hundreds of dollars of items from Thredup and was generally pleased with quality and the process. Recently, I decided to buy an outfit for an event. It took 13 days to receive 4 items shipping from same location. It all arrived two days after the event, so it is of no use to me. I know get to hand them over $10 of my money because of how poorly they run their company. This was also not a shipping issue; it was them NOT shipping my items that caused the delay. Never again and I’m happy to share that with as many people as I can.",1
1584,"Great shopping option: I have been pleasantly surprised more often than not. I absolutely love some of the items I’ve received but there have been a few that were worn/pulled more than expected, HOWEVER returns are extremely easy and when I received the wrong item it was also resolved immediately. 

I would like to see waist sizes on skirts. 

Sizes very from different manufacturers and although returns are easy, I would rather not have to send stuff back.",4
1585,"Goody Boxes are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!: So I ordered a GoodyBox and received it Fairly quickly. The items that were chosen for me were super cute and I really did truly love everything. Some of the items didn’t fit but it’s really hard when there’s different brands and items that have been worn, and washed etc. So that is just something that you’ll have to play around with. But as or the condition of everything, it was all JUST BEAUTIFUL! Thanks ThredUP for amazing customer service!!!!!!!! Xoxoxoxo",5
1586,"Changes: Some of the changes make it harder to navigate the site. The changes to the pricing makes it harder for the average consumer to make some money on items that they don’t wear anymore. I do believe that there should be more sorting facilities so that processing doesn’t take so long. Since there is only 4 facilities that our items get shipped too causing a huge processing backup. I understand you are trying to get an IPO to go public on the stock market, but it is also in your best interest to support the needs of your sellers that are suppling you with product to sell.",3
1587,"Great App but My Sizes Needs Work: I generally think the app is incredibly well-designed and very easy to navigate.  As a petite person I love that I can narrow down most searches by petites with one exception:  My Sizes has a button to “include petites” but it doesn’t let you select petite sizes.  So, as a Petite size 6 “My Sizes” always shows regular size 6 items along with Petite sizes (which is maddening when looking for a pair of pants that are on sale).  I would think the same would apply for tall people who want to just see tall sizes and exclude all regular sizes.",4
1588,"Love the app but needs bug fixes: This is the most convenient way for me to shop as I am always busy. I love the selection & although I had shipping issues in the beginning, everything got sorted out perfectly in the end. Lately, I have not seen any of my likes in my favorites, therefore I cannot tell what is available & what is not. I have the app updated so I’m not sure what’s happening. Hope this gets fixed soon so I can make my purchases.",5
1589,Fabulous shopping: I recently changed from a position where I wore scrubs all day to one where I wear casual business attire. I’ve put on a few pound & nothing in my closet fit. ThredUP helped me get a very nice wardrobe together in no time & at spectacular savings. I love trying the clothes on at home & the returns are so simple & no hassle. I’ve even learned that I can arrange for the post person to pick up the returns right from my porch. Check out the USPS app. Together things couldn’t be easier.,5
1590,"Poor customer service: I would give ZERO stars if i could! It takes a lot to make me upset but have a major issue with an item that I received that was not as described. I emailed ThredUP customer service 7 days ago with no response...so, after 5 business days, I sent another email...still no response. I then proceeded to start a “chat” with customer during their “business hours”...however, it showed their customer service as being “offline” and my chat inquiry went unanswered until they closed down their chat system for the day.
Buyer beware! If you spend your money with them...you may not get what you paid for and even worse... no customer service!",1
1591,"Terrible customer service: This company has terrible customer service!  I waited a over a week for a response about my package being sent to the wrong address (I changed the address before shipping but it went to the wrong address anyway) by then it had been delivered and they told me if I had contacted them before delivery they could have stopped it but now I just had to wait for someone to return it. I don’t know anyone at my old address, so I just had to wait. They never returned it and i am out over $200 for the entire box. I have had problems with the customer service before and i thought I would give them a second chance. Guess they won’t get a third.",1
1592,"So glad I found this app: Never a disappointment when I receive my items. I shop here often (1-3 packages a week) I have 5 children so paying full price in store isn’t always a great time... they have great products, some of the prices are a tad bit high for second hand, but the deals and promo codes help out a lot!! I recommend you check it out for yourself. I have already got 7 of my friends and family shopping through here",5
1593,"So Nice to Use!: Secondhand shopping or even discount shopping can be a bit daunting.  One can find themselves looking through so much inventory to find the magic item, that it hardly seems worth the trouble.  But, with Thred Up, one forgets they are shopping second hand.  The clothes are presented so well, and it’s so easy to find what works for you.  I like the idea of cleaning out my closet with this app too, because I can get more of what I love to replace.  I can wait fir my next shipment.",5
1594,"Love this!: ThredUP does a great job of picturing the items and giving a good idea of what shape they are in. I love shopping here for clothes because I know I am not contributing to the massive new clothing market and I am reducing my impact on the environment, as well as saving money!  I love how they are consistent in their mission to reduce and reuse, in that they ship items in paper cartons and envelopes, and wrap them in tissue paper.  No plastic! Such a plus for those of us trying to do our small part in being mindful of our “footprints”.",5
1595,"Okay: I like being able to shop items at lower prices.  My only concern is how little I got the second time I sent clothes.  The first time I received a credit for over $35.  The second time I only got a credit for about $18 and I even sent a brand new pair of shoes, never worn. The quality of items were about the same both times, so I was surprised that my credit was about half the second time.  All of the items I donated sold.  I am apprehensive now about sending in my clothes for credit.",4
1596,"Thread Up: I have shopped many thrift and consignment places in the last 20+years for clothing, but nothing tops Thread Up. The fact you can see the full design, description, quality of the clothing before you purchase is fantastic. I have spent the last couple years completely renewing my clothing collections , spending was less than it would cost me in any clothing store. Can’t give it enough praise. Love it!",5
1597,"Sometimes difficult to find what is there: Site is improved, but I would like more details on items.  More photos, more descriptors of items, more measurements.  

Today I had a lot of glitches during browsing, many (at least 10) “oops, something went wrong” pages, it even logged me out at one point.  I’m using a newer IPad, no problems today on any other sites so I know it’s not me.  

I persisted and found a great item today, though.",4
1598,"Like the app, but doesn’t work outside US (even if shipping to US): I travel often and I am not able to use the app anymore outside the US (even if I would be shipping to my US address).  The only workaround is using the website as a guest to browse items (can’t login on website either-same issue, get “Access Denied”).

Other than that, no issues with App or service. Would recommend to those who like to thrift.

When are you doing men’s clothes?",4
1599,"Love the service, dislike shipping and can’t reach Customer Service: I’ve shopped ThredUP for years and watched it grow. I love the products and the value provided! 

However, shipping is always an issue. Purchased items take 4-5 days to even ship. Then they are difficult to track and take longer than any other merchant. I’ve tried to reach Customer Service and it’s elusive through the app and disappointing. 

So, if you’re in no hurry to get/track/communicate about you’re purchases, ThredUP will not let you down.",3
1600,Charvette Howard: The blouses I have ordered have been too tight. I usually wear a 1X and I like things loose so I ordered a 3X and it is so tight across my breast. I have called trying to get a return label and authorization to return to no avail.  I have been on my computer trying to get a hold of these people and they never respond ever.I am extremely disappointed. I have ordered two other things and they’ve been tight also. Maybe women like things tight but I’m not one of them.,5
1601,"Love it!: Thred Up is awesome.  So many ways to find excellent quality used clothes.  Items I wouldn’t have found otherwise because they’re clothes from stores I wouldn’t normally shop at.  Love all the filters too.  They help so much on narrowing down the options.  
My only complaint is that the measurements aren’t always accurate.  I try and look at where the clothes lay on the mannequin instead.",5
1602,"I can’t stop: I used to dress almost completely second-hand, but the life changes involved in a pandemic made thrift shopping tough, so I found myself falling into the fast fashion trap. Enter second-hand shopping apps! 
I love love love ThredUP because not only can I reduce my environmental impact and find good deals, it’s also SUPER easy to use. The way I can narrow down the crazy selection to find exactly what I need???? PERFECT. So many more “ways to filter” then with other apps. Love ThredUP!!",5
1603,"Needed New Wardrobe, ThredUP delivered!: I recently lost 20 pounds in a month because of a health related restricted diet, and it was such a huge percentage lost from my starting weight that NOTHING I had in my closet fit me AT ALL. Enter ThredUP! I’m in love with this, and will never do new, in-store clothing shopping again! My new wardrobe is AMAZING, and for a fraction of the price I would have paid for brand new in these name brands! And the time it takes to look around clothing departments... I don’t ever have to do that again! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",5
1604,My new favorite way to shop: Super easy to navigate (although the app lacks a couple of the functions of the website) and returns are a snap. I returned one item that turned out different than the photo so I got a full refund. Another item I did not like the fit so sent it back for a reasonable small restocking fee. That fee is nothing compared to what I save over retail. All my other items have been excellent and just like the photos.,5
1605,"Wasn’t Aware....: ... That even if you are literally checking out (putting in your card information), the time still counts and your items are given away. This doesn’t seem right because no one would think this is okay if you’re checking out at a store and someone gets to grab something out of your cart while you are digging into your wallet. I felt violated. I honestly didn’t even want to buy anything else after that because that was the main item I was most excited about. Hence, it was in my cart the moment I saw it. This left a bad taste in my mouth and unless I get that item back or something better, I probably won’t be shopping here again.",1
1606,"First Purchase: I was very excited to purchase from this company. I was thrilled when I saw a fossil purse that looked brand new. I immediately put it in my cart and purchased the purse. I received my purse just in time. When I opened the box I was already disappointed. The purse looked so much smaller than on the mannequin; I really expected the purse to be bigger. I looked into returning the item...but being unaware of the company policy about purses (which...I don’t understand) I could not return the item to for a refund. I was stunned. I never write reviews, but I was highly disappointed. I have not purchased since this happened. I guess that’s what I get from just assuming they are like most online stores.",1
1607,"Love the app, could use minor improvements!: I’ve sold and purchased and had a great experience on both ends. 

I do wish items in the maternity section could be marked as nursing-friendly or there was a separate subcategory in maternity for nursing clothes. 

I also would love for there to be a section of brands to click on - more than the small handful shown on the front page of the app. I do enjoy searching by brand, but sometimes can’t think of all the brands I’d be interested in off top of my head.",4
1608,"This site is garbage: The amount I received for items sold is a joke. The first time I used ThredUP the amount I received for items sold was fair. The second time (and last time I will ever do business with them) the amount I am to receive  (considering the number of items and price they sold for) is horrible. Their payout scale is worst than bad. The section that I had to use for my payout wasn’t user friendly. When it finally worked, thredUP still ended up with $.17 of my money which I will never get because the minimum amount to transfer is $1.00. If I could have given them a minus star instead of the one star, it still wouldn’t reflect how bad thredUP is.  Don’t waste your time.",1
1609,Shopping Addict Trying to Help Clothing Waste: I absolutely love thredup for two reasons. That it has AMAZING brands for way cheaper - are your friends really going to notice those shoes are a little broken in? They’re going to think you did that! You can keep up with the high fashion of the world and stay trendy and stay right in your price range. Second reason - WHY WOULDN'T YOU THRIFT IF IT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT YOU LIVE IN?? Clothing waste is a huge problem and I absolutely love that this company does so much to help that.,5
1610,"Awesome Secondhand Online Store!: I started using the app just a couple of weeks ago. At first I was just browsing if they are good clothes to buy. I was actually excited to see cute tops and dresses that are in good condition in a very good price. So I purchased few dresses for the summer. When I recieved the items they were really nice. And I’m happy to get clothes that I like in affordable prices without leaving my home! 
I recommend this app! very fun & easy to use plus prices are really reasonable!",5
1611,I love it: I have to say that most of my clothes come from thredUP these days. But this is a review of the app and not the company (which I would easily give 5+ stars). I prefer the web interface over the app because the information is presented differently and makes more sense to me. The website also has a “recommended for me” feature that the app doesn’t seem to have. But I wouldn’t let these things deter me from using the app. It’s still pretty awesome.,5
1612,"Love it!!: Most of my wardrobe is from ThredUP. I speak highly of this company and I’ve never had a better time shopping for clothes. My coats, tops, dresses, pants, shorts, skirts are all from ThredUP. You can sort by size, condition, brand, price (and more, that’s just mostly what I sort by). You can “love” things so you can go back to it later when you have some money to spend. You have designer options. Returns are super easy if it doesn’t work out for you.  I love this app and company!",5
1613,"User friendly however: The app itself is great , very user friendly. However the site advertises that they take measurements on everything but I’ve found that to be false . The size is stated but that means nothing as it can vary brand to brand. Eg. Their more vintage clothes run two or more sizes smaller than their modern day counterparts. Making for regular returns on my account that I continually have to pay for. It’s starting to add up and I don’t feel like having a large balance for store credit that I may never use.",4
1614,"ThredUp is No Longer Worth It: Although ThredUp started out with the customer in mind, that’s no longer the case.  The payouts and consignment payout to sellers have dropped significantly.  It’s not worth the time and effort anymore.  In addition, as a buyer, you now have to pay significantly more for everything.  Again, no longer worth it.  ThredUp is another example of not leaving well enough alone.  It used to be good for the customer, now it’s just good for ThredUP!  No stars from me!!!",5
1615,"Secondhand fun: I absolutely love thredUP! I'm not a big thrift store shopper. Though I love getting secondhand pieces for my home, I find it hard to find quality articles of clothing at thrift shops near me. ThredUP has all of my favorite brands and makes it easy to narrow down by size/category/condition. (Tip: sort by newest to see what's just come in.)

I've never sold clothes to them and don't plan to do I can't speak to that side of things. But overall the prices are fair and there are promo/referral codes.",5
1616,"Can’t change shipping address: Really like thredup and have gotten some good deals. One major complaint is you cannot change the shipping address for your account once it’s created without customer support assistance. For someone who moves often this is frustrating, especially when the chat I sent on Friday wasn’t answered and there are no services available over the weekend. I had multiple items in my cart and had to remove them and hope I could get them back in before someone else did or else they’d expire. Seems a simple fix to allow people to change their own address.",2
1617,"Buying is great, selling is horrible.: I love buying things from Thredup, but selling is a disaster. I sent 2 full clean out bags to them that took months to process even past the expected date and I was ripped off. They accepted 14 items from my first bag and only paid me $5. I added everything up they sold and they made OVER $100. My second bag they accepted 9 or 10 items and only gave me $2. I’ve never had issues buying or returning things, but they’re ripping people off when it comes to buying their stuff. I won’t be sending any more of my clothes into them.",3
1618,Great selection: Love to shop at thredUP! The selection is great from designer to everyday wear. I’d love to see more pictures and wish I could zoom in to see the patterns/fabric up close. The site glitches at times which can be frustrating. Also shipping is takes a while. New fee added when selling your clothes takes away some of the incentive to mail them in the first place. Overall thredUP is my go to place when I’m shopping for clothes.,4
1619,"INACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS: Several times I have received item to find they do not fit the description in the online store. This week I received two items described as dresses that are actually jumpsuits. This was not shown in the photos either. I shop online to save time, but this ends up being a waste of time, because now I have to return them. Also hard to contact Customer Support. The ""Contact Us"" button in the app does not work! I had to look online, and then only email, so I have to wait for a response. Typically it has taken a few days to hear back.",2
1620,Makes thrifting fun and easy: I am always pleasantly surprised at the quality of my ThredUp items. And I love the thrill of setting up super precise searches (“Orange canvas satchel gently used or like new under $25”) and seeing TU return something that fits the bill exactly. I am tall and have also been surprised at the quantity of tall clothing to be found here. Literally all my workout gear is from TU. Bonus: I’m fighting the waste of “fast fashion” with every purchase. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5
1621,"The first place I go to shop!: ThredUP comes through every time. If I see an item I like I’ll look it up here and most of the time I can find it, or something similar, for half the price of new. Love how it saves your sizes so you know what you’re looking at is available to you. If something doesn’t fit returns are so easy. I save a fortune on high end work out clothes as well as every day items. The best!",5
1622,overall okay: i have been shopping w thred up for several years.  overall i think they have a great concept. i wish they were more consistent w their returns. sometimes i get a shipping label from fedex other times the post office. if the label is from fedex i drop it off at the fedex location and within several hours my account is credited minus the restocking fee (which has doubled from what it originally was several years ago) if the return label is from the post office you do not get the instant credit. i recently made a return at the post office on november 16th and it's been 11 days and my account still has not been credited. thats ridiculous. i also wish they were more thorough with the clothing inspections. i have purchased many things over the years that were in excellent condition and i returned them bc they had a stain or tear,3
1623,Sensational !!: That is exactly how I feel when I try on my selections. High quality clothing that I can afford !!! I have not been disappointed in my choices. My only wish ....more time to “search” the designer pieces. Thank you Thred Up for the opportunity to step it up a notch and increase my visibility in the corporate world. Plus I love all my Playtime clothing !! Only wish this had been my business concept...kudos to you !,5
1624,In Love: My absolute favorite company ever. I love secondhand clothes but I live in a small Midwest town so there’s only so much you can find at the goodwills or salvations army’s. There is EVERYTHING on this app. You can buy the most beautiful dress for $7. Or the cutest pair of shoes for $20. The amount of money I have spent on this app is insane. The amount of my boyfriends money I have spent on this app is even more insane. I think my entire closet is thredUP. I freaking love this company.,5
1625,"The only place I shop: I was very suddenly offered a job out of the house after working at home for 10 years. My wardrobe was not ready! But for $180 I was able to fully stock my drawers with work-appropriate duds that I LOVE! I buy all my clothes and all my kids’ clothes through ThredUP (well, occasional local consignment). My only complaint is that they don’t have menswear so I can’t also shop for my husband.",5
1626,"Loooove it!: I love this ease of convenience this app provides  for sustainable fashion. I have found so many gems! There are, however, a few reasons why I didn’t give it a five: 

1. In the “active shop from $6” section, there is an option for “sweatpants”. Unfortunately, when you click it, it originally said they couldn’t find anything matching that request. When I clicked it again, it showed almost everything with a few sweatpants sprinkled in. It’s those minute details that really optimize apps. 

2. I noticed that the measurements for pants aren’t always accurate, specifically the waist measurements, inseam and rise of bottoms. As a tall woman, it’s hard to find pants that properly fit. If you guys could accurately gather and list those measurements, I would greatly appreciate it! 

Keep up the great work!",4
1627,Terrible Service that takes your goods then never communicates with you again - Cleanout service: It’s a bit concerning to me that my cleanout bag was received on July 20th and I am yet to get an update on if anything can be sold from it or not. It hasn’t even been updated as PROCESSED yet. It has been over 3 months. The least you can do is ping to say it is still going to be reviewed but no communication. At this point it seems I have sent a bag of my clothes and shoes to this company for free. Terrible communication I will advocate for others NOT to use your service. What is the difference between THREDUP and Goodwill? Goodwill would have been a MUCH better decision.,1
1628,"Buyer & Seller Perspective: As a buyer, the prices are quite high for preowned items. I find the prices on Poshmark and Mercari are better, but I have found some good items on here. I like that many can be returned. 

As a seller, the payouts are SO LOW. I sent them $1000 worth of name-brand items (LOFT, JCrew, Boutique), most still with tags. They accepted 80% of them, then gave me a payout of $24. I was moving and couldn’t take all the inventory with me, which is why I decided to send them a Clean Out box, but if I sold them myself on Poshmark I would have easily made $300-$400. 

One example: a LOFT sweater, brand new with tags (NWT), retail $79, on trend style and colors. It sold and they gave me $0.24! 24 cents! 

Bottom line: sell items yourself or donate them. Don’t give Thred Up free inventory, it will just make you feel angry when you get nothing in return. Better to donate it and feel good about it.",3
1629,"Kind of fun, but often a hassle: I love the ability so secondhand shop from my phone, and Thredup has an AMAZING filtering service to find clothes that suit my style. Unfortunately, as was mentioned in other reviews, the service can be hit or miss. Another problem is that the sizing descriptions on each of the clothes are very unclear. It isn't clear if the measurements listed are taken on a garment laying flat or include the full circumference, and sometimes they are missing all together. Absolutely would love to see improvement on that.",3
1630,"No longer accepts Affirm for payment: I’ve been using ThredUp for years now to buy my kids clothes. They recently made the decision to not use Affirm anymore and only use AfterPay, AfterPay has very restrictive payment plans of only biweekly payments versus Affirm giving many different options. Also AfterPay doesn’t accept Discover cards at all and is very limited on which credit cards they can work with. This has ultimately made me decide to stop using ThredUp moving forward. I’m a single mom of two and I always pay on time but adding so many restrictions now is ridiculous.",2
1631,"Non existent customer support, unable to retrieve my sales: ThreadUP received my CleanOut Bag over 6 months ago, my bag is registered and my clothes have been listed and sold, yet the website continues to give me an error message when I attempt to view my sales. Customer support is nonexistent. I have tried for the past 6 weeks to get support on retrieving my sales and have received a continuous error message and no customer support. The company doesn’t offer customer support, only written suggestions on how to navigate possible issues. This is unhelpful when the app doesn’t function and only provides error messages.",1
1632,"Worst Customer Service and Super Slow Processing: If you need help, it’s impossible to reach anyone. And if you sell anything on Thredup, the processing time is 3+ months. It’s been 13 weeks since I submitted a bag to sell items and they have yet to process same. They keep changing the estimated processing time and it’s expected to be another 4 weeks. I can’t get ahold of anyone for explanation or expedition of processing. It’s ridiculous!",5
1633,"Kinda 100% Obsessed Tbh: I never review anything because it’s just not my thing, but oh baby! I am obsessed with ThreadUp!!!! I got into in because My Favorite Murder suggested it and omg I’m addicted. Literally my favorite app to scroll. I have purchased more clothes in the last two years than like ever and they are NICE (like fancy but not a million dollars). If you are a bargain shopper but you have a taste for the boujee, download ThredUP. 10/10 highly recommend.",5
1634,"Losing momentum: I was a die hard thredUP user for years, but over the past year I have been less than impressed. I’ve noticed a few things are only $3-$5 more to buy brand new on the brand site - with free shipping, that ends up cheaper! BUT THE WORST is the shipping - I just placed an order for 1 item and in the time it took to process, I ordered and RECEIVED 5 orders from another consignment site…I am STILL waiting for my thredUP shipment.",5
1635,"Never using again.: I’m never using thredUP again. I responded to their order protection email the day after they sent it. 2 days ago. I talked with them today about why it hasn’t been confirmed and the girl said it would be. I went to take a nap and woke up to an email that my entire order was canceled. They claimed to never have gotten my email. When I sent a screen shot of my reply email, which listed the date it was sent, they said they couldn’t do anything and I’d have to wait 72 hours for the items to be re-listed. The basis of the whole order was to have stuff for my bachelorette weekend and now I have nothing.",1
1636,"Love thredUP. Suggestion for new filter.: I love thredUP. They have nice items for a great price. I have loved everything I have received so far. I have a suggestion about putting sleeve length as a filter option ie. none, short, 3/4, and long. That would save a lot of time for people who are looking for a specific sleeve length. They would not have to keep scrolling through hundreds of items to find what they are looking for.",5
1637,"Excellent customer service: Wow! Shipped to wrong address because I forgot to check profile. Quick response to email and I had no hope this would be reconciled but Josie was on top of it with results and suggestions. Refund applied when items shipped back to Thredup. Admittedly some items are overpriced for thrifting but if you know the price point you’ll find some real bargains. Thumbs up, five stars for outstanding customer service! Thank you Josie!",5
1638,Love/Kinda Shady: I’ve only used this app a few times and LOVE how easy it is to return items. The customer service is speedy and efficient. The only mild issue I have had is that I bought a pair of cute sunglasses for around $22 and when they arrived they said “Mrs. Worldwide Bach” on one of the legs. And they were made of pretty cheap plastic. So I was confused why I paid over $20 for a pair of sunglasses that were clearly a party favor for someone’s Bachelorette party. Kind of a scam but that’s the only issue I have had. I had a laugh and mourned the money I lost.,4
1639,MERRY CHRISTMAS..TO ME ...: Hi threadup...I am a new customer and have only been on here for about a month and it has been the best experience I’ve ever had at a thrift store..so much selection and great prices as well..Thank you for having this online treasure especially in such chaotic and unknown times I’m so impressed with everything I’ve received and refer you to all my friends and family II.. I’ve lost 140 lbs since October 23/19 ... went from a size 22 to a 10..so this site has been a god send for me ...I’m a loyal customer for life... Happy holidays Threadup.. Great job!,4
1640,"Amazing Customer Service: I have ordered from ThredUP 5 times, and only had an issue with a listing once. It wasn’t as described so I reached out to customer service via email and they got back to me right away. I supplied them with pictures (without being prompted, I figured they’d want pictures anyway) and they issued me a full refund. I’ve also reached out to them before inquiring about the size of a few dresses, and they were very polite and helpful.",5
1641,"Nonexistent Customer Service: I wanted to like this service. I was hesitant though, but after reviewing the return policy I was comfortable with the idea of a small restocking fee per item. I ordered the items, and some were way more worn than advertised, some didn’t fit, etc. I decided to return a few items, until I found out that returns cost WAY more than just a restocking fee. I reached out to customer service and never heard back. The cofounder also supposedly sent an email to new customers, and I responded to that and STILL no response. Terrible customer service, unclear return policy. I am extremely disappointed with the experience and will not be purchasing in the future.",1
1642,"Love it, the best thrift shopping app ever!: Way better than other apps I’ve used for buying used. Threadup allows returns which is #1 in my book. You shouldn’t be stuck with an item if it doesn’t fit - which is what other apps do. Also the clothes are really good, their standards are high. The clothes are exactly how they appear which is again, not like other apps that try hard to make the clothes look better than they actually are.",5
1643,"Extremely user friendly: After being a solid seller/buyer for over 2 years, I’m done with this shady company. My latest bag I sent them had an expensive pocketbook and several pairs if barely worn leather name brand shoes. Non of those items made it onto my sell list. Really???? 
I think they resell items on eBay or some other site. Done with this thieving group. Beware before sending anything of real value.
And their customer service is awful!",5
1644,"Easy to use: Super easy and fast to use. Problems — I don’t think the “condition” filter on the clothes is always accurate; it would give me clothes that were more wear than what I had in my filter. Further, there is a filter called “work” but it does nothing to actually filter work/professional clothing. Also, it would be nice to be able to scroll through the cart rather than going back and forth to view items.",5
1645,I LOVE THREDUP: I literally LOVE. THREDUP. I don’t like shopping at in person thrift stores so this is a great way for me to shop sustainably online. I never thought I would order so much clothes from THREDUP. I honestly think I might be addicted. If you’re looking for cheap basics definitely go to the outlet tab in the app. That tap has the cheapest things. Might take a while to get the hang of it but once you do you’ll love it and you’ll keep ordering more.,5
1646,Had to switch devices to get free shipping: I saw that if you use the App to place orders the shipping was free.  So in the process of placing my order from my phone the shipping did go to $0.00 but when I got to the Place You Order page the shipping was showing $5.99.  I switched from my phone to my iPad and was able to place my order with free shipping.  Could have been a glitch but it take more time by trying several times from my phone and sending an email.  Still love the concept of this sight.,4
1647,"App is fine--company is horrible!!!: Be cautious when doing business with Thred Up!  Some of the items they sell are priced way too high for used items.  Know how much things are worth before buying.  And even more importantly, DO NOT send your stuff in to sell to them.  They will either not accept your items, or give you pennies for items that they are going to turn around and sell for $12-15.  I sent a bag of kids clothes that was new with tags or stuff that was worn once or twice.  They accepted 11 items and gave me $6.00.  They will probably make $150 on the stuff I sent.  I would have rather gave the stuff away!!   Read other reviews on them.  They are not positive!",1
1648,"Sad at the Changes: Thred Up has made a lot of changes that are negative as a buyer and a seller. First, just be aware that about 20% of the time the item you receive will not match the description (measurements, condition, etc.) which wouldn’t be such a problem if it wasn’t prohibitively costly to return something. Second don’t even think about selling on here any more. I need to spend $18 for an app to just accept my items because they charge for a bag and a processing fee? No thanks. Payouts used to be decent but now I don’t even bother. Also as another reviewer commented it’s next to impossible to use your points on purchases.",1
1649,This is a scam: I sent in a huge bags of beautiful clothes. Amazing most of which were not deemed worthy of them selling. And the few things they did sell I was only given a few cents per item and then they are deducting a processing fee (which was supposed to be waived) so in reality I will get nothing. Save your time and effort. I could have easily taken the items to the local charity and then they would have been appreciated by someone who needed them.  I will NEVER do another clean out with them. Nor will I purchase any items knowing that the person who sent them in is getting nothing and the only profit is going to Threadup.,1
1650,"Yikes: This site has gotten worse and worse. They sell stuff for $30, pay the consignor $2.50, and can’t even take decent photos or do anything in a timely manner. I have sent in thousands and thousands and thousands of $ worth of clothing thinking I was helping an ethical and somewhat green company. I ordered a couple things and paid so much more than they were worth- but whoever sent them in got nothing for it. You’re better off just donating your clothes, this company is awful. I will be happy to see them dissolve someday, hopefully soon. Thredup is a crappy version of goodwill, except they’re good for no one but presumably the execs.",1
1651,"Makeover central: Threadup,
I discovered the threadup website on instagram. I love the ease of the website. I processed two returns and that was a super simple process. I like the variety of choices on the website. I can get dresses for our new granddaughter at an affordable cost. I have been in the process of making over my closet with many exciting new outfits! 

I’m glad my choices of using threadup are good for the earth. Thank You, Dolores",5
1652,"Goody Boxes are the best!: I started using this for cute maternity clothes at the beginning of the pandemic. I didn’t know what to expect (with the clothes or the baby! 😂) but I kept multiple items from each box. Prices are great, and I feel better about buying used clothes. I’ve also bought several things between boxes and love the prices, styles, and filtering available! Would def recommend.",5
1653,"Product numbers please!: I love this service. It makes me feel great knowing I am helping recycle great clothing. However, I wish thredUP would add product numbers for their clothing. I would like to look up the items to get a little more info or details as sometimes descriptions are vague. I usually stick with brands and products I know. I would love to branch out and try new things, but I don’t know enough about them to try it. A product number would help!",4
1654,"Easy to find top brands in new condition: Thred Up has so much inventory on hand that I find the best way to use it is to identify a couple of brands you prefer and your sizes in those brands and then use their search engine. If you only want new with tags, you can also put that in your search criteria. Prices are great. Also, there is usually now a $1.99 restocking fee for items you want to return but I believe that the return shipping is still free.",5
1655,Previously a fan but perturbed: I have been a fan of this site until this particular experience. I purchased a designer backpack with an estimated retail of $3900. Upon further research I found that it actually is a custom order priced at $1700. The item in question has scratches which were noted and was priced at 92% off (typically enough to make anyone look twice!) but I find the price discrepancy disturbing as the MOST expensive item from the designer was $2400 and obviously more detailed and labor intensive than the item I was purchasing. I can’t fathom how the team of experts arrived at their analysis but it certainly taints my trust in their other valuations.,2
1656,"Love it: This company has changed the way I shop.  It’s fun, and slightly addictive to use because the inventory is constantly updated.  I have made many purchases and love almost everything I have received.  It’s saving money for me and resources for the world.  Frankly, I doubt I’ll buy new again.  I wish there was slightly more sizing information but I’ve done well with fitting so far.  So glad I was referred here!",5
1657,"almost perfect: i love this app and use it all the time. my one BIG complaint is that the measurements are often very off. a listing for a pair of pants will say it has a 27” waist in one place, and then in another place say it has a 30” waist. or the pants will be listed as a size 4 and then the waist measurement will be listed as 30”+, which doesn’t make much more sense. it’s very frustrating when this happens, and i’d like to see a change in this soon because it often results in me not making as many purchases as i would with accurately measured items.",3
1658,"Keep cancelling my order. They never respond. STAY AWAY!!: I am one of three women that live at and use this address. Everytime I place an order and my mother-in-law places an order, THEY CANCEL IT WITHOUT REASON and don't respond to use when we reach out. They only allow one person here to actually place orders. According to her, they rip you off with the consignment too and it's impossible to cash out. If you share an address with another person don't bother with this company! Awful to NO customer service at all. Cancelling my account. I sent in items for consignment and because they continue cancelling orders they better send my items back to me for FREE. Stay away from this company!!",1
1659,"Only 1 star because I have to: A few months back I requested a clean out bag and filled it up with tons of great name brand and designer items I could have sold elsewhere for over $150. My total payout for all things sold was a whopping $26 dollars, however I accepted this because it was a convenient way to get rid of clothes and make a few bucks. I used requested another clean out back a few weeks ago and again filled it up with tons of name brand/designer clothes is perfect condition, this time more clothes and they are only giving payouts of like 11-12% on my clothes... for instance a $9.99 item I will only receive $0.75!!! This is absurd. They are taking 88-89% and I only receive 11-12%!!!",1
1660,Slow....slow....slow...: It is unreal how slow the shipping and returns are with this company. I sent a return back on August 1st and I still don’t have my refund credit posted as of August 15th. I have also been waiting for several weeks for a clean out kit. I am also still waiting for my questions on these waits to be answered by customer service. The shopping and deals are great if you are extremely patient and willing to endure endless waits.,5
1661,"Awful Customer Service: I purchased a pair of boots that ended up being damaged and unwearable. Trying to get an actual refund versus a store credit was a huge hassle and the customer service reps I dealt with just made me feel like an inconvenience. Not to mention, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a live person. My annoyance made me do a little research and found that some of the other items I bought had inflated “suggested retail pricing” to make the “deal” I was getting look better than it was. Do your research before buying and pray you don’t have to return something for a refund. I personally will not take another chance with this company and will be sticking with my local secondhand retailers.",1
1662,"Almost Great: Love the items I receive.. and it’s simple to return the ones that don’t work out.  However I only purchase from about five consistent brands and yet it takes quite a bit of time to search.  Could use a better search and suggestion filter! The suggestions provided are not accurate to brands and styles I consistently purchase. 
Shipping is costly as compared to other online stores and time to receive is quite long.  
Basically just want a better/faster way to get stuff so I could use the site more frequently.",3
1663,Love this company: This site is amazing. The clothes are almost always just as described and the measurements are usually accurate. I’ve ordered a lot over the last couple of years so of course a few items have not been as expected. I love having the measurements to determine what will fit. Would like to have waist measurements for skirts.  PLEASE. I work in a professional setting and I get complimented on my clothing Daily. Thanks to ThredUP I can afford those compliments.,5
1664,Rip off: The App is easy to use and navigate but the consignment part is a scam. If you use this app to sell clothes they resell your items for more than 70% off retail and only pay you out less than 1-2% off the sale! If you have the time it’s almost better to just sell your clothes yourself on eBay or Poshmark were as you earn more than 50% of your sales. This place basically uses this app to get you to basically donate your used clothes for free so they can make a 90% profit. You do better donating to your local Goodwill than spending time and money to ship clothes to ThredUP and only receive less than 2>%,2
1665,"Deleted. Will never sell to you again: I made the mistake of req a bag to send my shoes, hoping that they would sell for a DECENT amount. For starters, it took over 2 months to process my shoes. I sent over 15 pairs of shoes that ranged in brands from Steve Madden to Jessica Simpson. If a 30+ year old wouldn’t buy it I’m certain a teenager or young adult would. Out of all those shoes, all I got was a payout of $3.00????? I would’ve had better luck selling on Poshmark. This is a lesson learned. I will never make that mistake again, because this app has been deleted. I advise anyone to think before you send your things to this company. And as for the shoes that wasn’t accepted? Who knows what happened to them. Total scam!!!!",1
1666,"Restocking fees, shipping fees, long wait for delivery: I used to like thred up and recommend it to others.  It is no longer a bargain due to restocking fees and shipping fee changes.  Also less of my items have been accepted when I sent my used items as were in the past.  Now there is less reason to shop here - I can easily find $20-$30 brand name sweaters that are new and on sale, and not pilling, and I will receive them much faster with free shipping.",5
1667,"Experience getting worse and worse: I used to shop on the app all the time and got some great clothes at good value. They recently instituted a restocking fee that makes is must less cost effective to try on clothes at home or take a risk on a new brand or style. In general, their customer service and customer experience is on the decline. 
As for selling, I’ve done multiple clean/out bags and their payouts have tanked. I send in look-like new clothing from up-market boutiques—nothing you can find in a mall. They’ve just started accepting less and paying out less. They also have some “bargain basement” items on the app which I suspect are skimmed from bags without a payout. It’s super sketchy. Steer clear.",1
1668,"Love, love, love!: I absolutely love ThredUP! I have completely changed my way of shopping and instead of going through my emails and see what’s on sale at my local shopping mall I go straight to the website and can’t find new or how’s the new items for a fraction of the cost. I have also recycled so many items that I no longer wearing for a great price and enjoy having credit to shop with. How did I live so long without knowing about this site?",5
1669,"1st time and hooked!: Well... I placed my 1st order 1 week ago. I ordered 5 pairs of pants and 6 tops. The next day I ordered a sweater, shirt and a pair of capris. I’m HOOKED,  my order came today packed very well, all clothes are wrapped in polka dot tissue paper. Everything fit and looks so cute! I placed another order today:))
Don’t hesitate, just try this company. I also ordered a clean out kit to send in some of my items. I ordered true to size med tops and size 10 pants. I’m 5’4, 143. 
Sincerely, 
A very happy customer ☺️👍🏻❤️",5
1670,"Great buys...very, very slow selling process: I’ve been using ThredUP for almost a year and I love the great deals I’ve found on quality merchandise. I’ve even returned things that weren’t quite right without any issue. The selling process is ok. I’ve had success and the communication with the seller is good, just don’t do it if you’re in a hurry. It can take months from the time you send your items to ThredUP until they process and credit your account.",5
1671,They need free shipping and less restrictive cleanout bag fees: I was really into thredUP a year or two ago. I frequently cleaned out my closet and mailed a lot of stuff in. Then they started subtracting $10 from the value of the cleanout bag. With the amount of good clothes they reject and the very little they pay you for what they do accept this is not OK with me. Furthermore for a little while they offered free shipping if you shopped thru their app. I placed about 5-6 orders in the course of a couple months. Now they’ve gotten rid of the free shipping so I’m done with both aspects of thredUP. Just not worth it for selling or for buying.,3
1672,Dress for cruise: The best app to go to for the right size and selection! Great prices and good quality! I’ve searched everywhere for the perfect dress to wear on my cruise for the Red night event! Found a gorgeous red dress that’s perfect and fits my body frame! This app helped me more than others out there! Now I’m ready to go and relax and not worry about not having a beautiful dress! Thank you for making this easy for me! Best decision all around!,5
1673,"Credits (money) just went missing: I’ve been using this company for a long time and have noticed a lot change not for the best. I sold with them multiple times and got a decent chunk of credits I’ve been saving up to make a order with. I checked my account today  and $40 of my credits are missing. I never made a order or requested a check for said money it’s just now missing. I’m quite upset because if I knew my money would just disappear I would have requested my money in a check. I reached out customer service and have not heard back from, I’m beyond frustrated. How do credits just go missing!?",1
1674,Such a fun and easy way to shop second hand: I love this app! I pop on every once in a while to see what’s available. I love to thrift and that fact that I can do that while sitting in my comfy chair at home makes it a million times better. The best is that they provide the measurements on the clothing. That has been a game changer for me since I have long arms and legs. Shopping on this app is mostly guilt free. Love thredup!!,5
1675,"It works. It’s great… But…: When you order items and get what you actually ordered, it’s pretty good. That being said, it seems more often than not I keep getting items in incorrect categories and they won’t let me return them. I understand that some items are not returnable, but when it’s your fault and not mine, there should be an exception. I get T-shirts that are in the women’s category that are little girls and I get actually quite frequently women’s pants that I order that come in petites. I am a tall woman and would never order a petite pant. They really need to work on who’s listing the items, I think I’m about done using them.",1
1676,"Increasingly not worth it: I’ve been shopping with Thredup for a few years and have gotten quite a few great finds. It’s usually my go to for thrift shopping. However it’s very hit or miss and it’s becoming a waste of time. Sizing descriptions can be completely inaccurate, quality is inaccurate (“excellent” condition items have obvious stains, holes), shipping takes forever and you have to pay return fees and restocking fees if you want to get anything but a shopping credit refund. Not worth my time or money anymore.",3
1677,"Beyond amazing: What can you dislike? Easy searches & buys, easy returns, if necessary. I find all kinds of items for my family, we live rural so it’s nice to have variety and labels we do not see (or won’t afford up front) I am thankful for all the great items everyone sells on here and they do a great job with display & descriptions. I tell many people about the site when I’m questioned on my attire (or my kids’) Thanks!!",5
1678,"Love!: I buy most of my clothes from Goodwill, other thrift stores (like ThredUP), and occasional clearance sections. I love ThredUP because they have top brands and a rewards program that saves me money. Plus, I feel good knowing I’m not contributing to fashion waste but am instead recycling clothes instead of throwing them away. 

Also, the goody boxes are so fun! I have gotten several and I always love everything in them and want to buy it all!",5
1679,"Was great until they changed it: While I still use the app, they changed it making searching more difficult.  There used to be a ‘search similar’ feature that was extremely convenient.  Could look for something I liked in a different size or if an item I liked sold, could search for a similar item.  Much more difficult now.  I would have given 5 stars before the change.  Poshmark still has a similar feature.  It needs to come back.",3
1680,"Never buying retail again: I wish I found this app earlier. I don’t like spending the time going OUT to shop for clothes. This app also helps with styling and exposing me to brands I’ve never heard of, or may not have access to where I live. I love the filter feature. Two recommendations I would make: include a men’s clothing option and be able to share your favorites list with another ThredUP user.",5
1681,"ADDICTED: I don’t even know where to start. I tell everyone about this app. I’ll steal another reviews quote, “champagne taste with a beer budget.” Clothes always come smelling and looking clean and fresh. I suggest heavily filtering your search or it will be overwhelming. My whole closet will be from ThredUP before long. My only complaint is that they are out of clean out kits and you have to send in your own box but, that means lots of new clothes coming in! Will never stop using ThredUP.",5
1682,"Amazing!: I’ve gotten such wonderful items from this app, and they always are in such great condition! I haven’t completely found my style yet, but this app really helped starting my journey to find it. The app is very easy to use, and you have so many options on how to filter items. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that you can track your items after they’ve been ordered. Love this app!",5
1683,"Could use some work: The idea of ThredUp is great, and it was super easy to use. What I am not a fan of is that it took FIVE months for my items to be reviewed and put up for sale. Another thing I’m not a fan of is that if your items don’t sell in a certain amount of time, they expire and you don’t get the money for them, and from what I’ve read, you have to pay them if you want anything back? It’s super easy and convenient for stuff you’re getting rid of anyway, but I would definitely not recommend sending nicer, better quality items that you could sell yourself on other apps.",2
1684,"Best Sopping App: I have always loved ThredUP and recently decided to get the app. I was skeptical at first, thinking I’d just download it for the initial discount you get for downloading the app and then delete it after, but I found myself using that instead of the website anytime I wanted to shop. The app is so user friendly and easy to use for anyone! 
Plus discounts are constantly given for those who use the app so it’s definitely a win win if you love thredUP!",5
1685,"Horrible Customer Service, AVOID: Like the concept, but their inability to deal with the most basic issues (recent example: I sent my package to the wrong address, noticed immediately upon completing the order, but was unable to edit this myself—instead had to EMAIL, and by the time they got to my email “nothing could be done as it is in transit;” they suggested I put a mail forwarding notice on this other address, thus putting more work on USPS in the midst of the pandemic). This example is indicative of their unwillingness to take any responsibility but rather to act as a platform and make money off of transactions whilst having no care for the consumer experience or needs.",1
1686,"Sustainable and user friendly: I love that ThredUp encourages buying secondhand clothing. Thrift shopping isn’t for everyone, a lot of people are overwhelmed by the idea of checking everything to make sure there aren’t signs of wear. But ThredUP does that for you and also makes it easy to make a few bucks off of clothes in your closet you don’t wear. It’s a great business model and I’ve made decent money and used it to buy some items I love at an insane price.",5
1687,Love love love: I’m not sure how long I’ve used Thred Up but I absolutely love it. There are so many different things to choose from regardless of what you are looking for. I’m a very busy person so I like when I have a few minutes to browse I can save a couple of things to look at later. There are also unique options. I like not being cookie cutter and thred up allows me to do that. Not to mention making it very affordable. I can go on and on.....,5
1688,"I used to love thredUP now I’m believing all the reviews!: This company started out strong and now it’s becoming a joke! Customer service is the worst I’ve ever experienced, they “chatted” with me like I was completely ignorant and didn’t know how basic functions of checking out a cart works. All I was try to figure out was why my $150 in Christmas gift cards weren’t working. I have received absolutely no answers and as of right now I consider my gift cards as stolen by this company. They told me I can only use gift cards on the website from a laptop or desktop computer. Well, to my surprise there’s no gift card option, once again.",1
1689,"Great selection, Fun shopping!: Good quality at fair prices.  Plenty to choose from and the filters —- size, color, brand, condition—- make it easy to find what you’re looking for. 

Customer service is atrocious. S-L-O-W. And not too bright.  You’ll get a rote response that misses the target. Every time.  It takes a LOT of time and persistence to get the answers / help you need

Shop to your heart’s content.  As long as there are no questions / issues / errors, you’ll be fine!",5
1690,"Amazing!: I don’t know what I expected from a second hand clothing site, but I was blow away with the amazing attention to detail and care! The clothing is impeccable, they wrap it beautifully, and it came so quickly. They have everything you could imagine, and I love it. If I could recommend one thing to make things easier to shop, it would to be able to search for things like graphic tees or band tees specifically. Other than that, LOVE THIS SITE.",5
1691,"Ugh!!: Customer service needs big time improvements. It’s difficult to even find a number. You can email, but won’t see a response in several days. Other problem is, the items that I am selling have wrong descriptions. One says my top has minor fading and wear. It’s never been worn! Plus, it’s black and they say it’s blue. I have a shrug and they call it a top?! Nobody is going to buy that as a top! It won’t cover your boobs! No way of editing any items. Whatever they write is how it stays. Very frustrating to buy as well. Sizes are listed differently from the detail page. Review won’t work unless to put 5 stars!!!",2
1692,"Glacial Payout and Processing Times: I use ThredUP to do my closet clean outs. Although I am not looking to get much back, I am astonished at the rate of time it takes to get your bag processed. My most recent bag took 2 1/2 months to go up on the site. After my items started to sell, I couldn’t check my payout dates. They disappear after a few days. I am sure one is now overdue and I can check dates on the others. It seems like this slow process is really just discouraging the consignment side of their business. I have only been lucky enough to get upfront payout once and of course this was on my first bag. Try at your own risk.",2
1693,Never sell through them!!: I thought it would be nice to sell items on there. First off the items you send them that they don’t accept get donated unless you purchase a shipping bag to get those items sent back to you. Alright sure I get it I guess.. but then- once an item sells you make like 25¢ on each one (Really?!) and then the items that don’t sell that they list you need to also pay for shipping to “reclaim” them and get them sent back to you. So essentially I’m out money 🤷‍♀️🙄 ALSO the things listed are fairly out of date and way overpriced! Not worth it! As soon as my items come in I’m deleting my account through them and deleting the app!!,1
1694,"Nothing but LOVE: I’ve made several purchases with thredup over the past few months. Absolutely obsessed with this app, have received some high quality and unique items for the low. I’ve purchased entire wardrobes for my 2 daughters ages 3 and 6 and found many items that were new with tags. The few returns I’ve made have been easy. I’m so happy with everything and look forward to my next package in the mail",5
1695,"Love it! It’s like savers, but in app form: I’ve ordered a few things from here, currently waiting for (another) box! The clothes I’ve received so far have been in great shape, no damages or stains, and it ships in good time. Very happy, the only thing is (like all online clothes shopping) some sizes are a little off, which isn’t really the apps fault as the tags all had the same size but companies may have changed that size for themselves.. but still, only one pair of leggings felt too small for me, so over all I’m very pleased!",4
1696,Awesome experience: Started using a couple of months ago to purchase.  Quality clothing sent with my first purchase.  I did not keep some things and the return method is simple and easy.  I just sent my first clean out bag a few weeks ago.  I have another one to send.  My first purchase gave me a better understanding of the quality they look for.  I used that knowledge to fill my first clean out bag.  Hope it brings positive results 😊,5
1697,"Great Idea, Prices Need Work: When I first came to the site, I thought it was great. The longer I have used it, I have noticed there prices going up. They are basically selling the clothing like it is not secondhand. They are comparing used clothing to a new retail price. Especially on the kids clothes, I think they could work on their prices. I can buy active pants for my boys for the same price on a sale that I can buy them on ThredUP. Why would I buy secondhand when I can buy items for the same price new?",4
1698,"Satisfied and happy customer!: I absolutely love ThredUP! It’s super convenient for everyone’s busy lifestyle! And I love recycling clothes, so it makes me feel good to support them!! Highly recommend them, even if you’re weary about purchasing online they have free returns! Easy on the commitment and the prices are SO good! I also appreciate that each listing tells you the condition the item is in because that’s hard to determine just based on the picture! Thank you ThredUP!",5
1699,"Needs improvement: I really enjoy Thred Up for purchasing my wardrobe. However I came across a frustration which I’m sure I’m not alone in experiencing this.

The order system allow 24 hours to reserve items into the cart which is great but there are customers that are abusing this reservation
system. 

There are customers that hold items in their cart for multiple consecutive days— they remove the item before the clock runs out of time and then adds it back on to their cart so prolonging the reservation,  day after day.

Perhaps Thred up can implement a minimum wait time before that shopper is able to add the item back into their cart. This gives buyers has a chance to buy items if this customer do not purchase after that maximum hold period. 

It is not fair to other buyers that they can keep reserving indefinitely and not purchase. There are buyers who would love to buy those items but those items are continually unavailable.",2
1700,"LOVE THREDUP: I love ThredUp, it’s very fun to shop and they have incredible deals, pricing and brands. Compared to buying new things the price is like $1000 to $100!! 
It’s easy to find things for your style and love that it is sustainable to!! Their customer service is awesome as well , so much help and real people (not AI). The one problem is that things don’t always look the same as in the picture and sizing is tricky, but totally worth it!!",5
1701,I wish I had read the reviews: I was very excited when I discovered this app because I have lots of clothes that I have nothing to do with! So I sent in my bag and even requested another because I had more but now I will not be sending a second bag. The amount of money you get for the payouts is RIDICULOUS whoever is running this is a serious scam artist. It's not right and once they take the stuff you can't get it back. I had multiple brand new items at which they listed for 10x more than the payout. I wish I read the reviews before sending my stuff in. I hope this helps anyone who is curious about the site. HIGHLY disappointed will not be selling to them ever again.,1
1702,"Highly Recommend: I’ve loved using the ThredUP app this last year. The return policy is fair and straightforward. I feel good knowing that if something shows up and I’m not 100% in love with the item I can return it within a certain number of days at no cost. 

I’ve recommended ThredUP to friends and family and they’ve enjoyed using it too!

The quality of the pieces I’ve purchased have been like-new. ThredUp has high standards for the clothes and accessories they carry and that makes me feel good knowing that even though I’m getting something secondhand it won’t have large holes and stains.

The only change I’d like to see happen: 

Include more images of the items from all angles. Accessories like belts and scarves usually only have a single image. I’d like to see more to get a better sense of the product and the quality of the material.",4
1703,"Fun to shop but sizing is a nightmare: Please update the sizing/measurement policies! Some of the items I can't figure out why they choose to measure what they do. What difference does the length of a skirt make if I can't tell what the waist size is? Pants list waist and length sizes, why don't skirts and dresses? It would also be great if I could put in my measurements somewhere and be able to filter out the items whose tags say they're my size but whose actual measurements say otherwise. I hate seeing something I like in my size only to find out it's eight inches too small in the bust. Fix the sizing please!",3
1704,"Love with room for improvement: Love the selection, love the layout. I see a wide variety of option and each item I have received was great condition. My only complaint is the time for shipping. I wish we had a faster option because 10 days feels like forever!! Also I wish I would occasionally get a $10 off coupon or something in my email. Or having the option to build points for the amount of money you spend. But they are all stuff I can live with!!",4
1705,Easy to shop!: Love the app! Super easy to use. The filters are all super useful and being able to track the things you like makes shopping easy! The only thing I would add are more measurements. Items like jackets have no chest or length measurements and skirts also lack a measurement for waist. I tend not to purchase those items to avoid risking having to return items later.,5
1706,"ThredUP is great…the app is not: I love ThredUP but the app is so annoying. It logs me out literally every time I close it. Even just for a couple seconds. My banking app keeps me logged in longer. 
So I’ll open it and start searching, and the minute I try to favorite something or add it to my cart, I have to log in again. Which would be fine, except unlike many other e-commerce sites, it doesn’t save my place or my search or bring me back to the item I was looking at. So if I’ve found something cool, I have to start my search over from scratch. So frustrating.",2
1707,"Sad I used to love thred up DISAPPOINTED!: So I purchased a nonreturnable Kate spade bag which I loved the layout and color but after only 8-9 wks the handles cracked peeled apart! I reached out to customer service so disappointed and they gave me 30% refund, the bag wasn’t cheap! I won’t use a bag in this condition so it’s money lost and I guess a lesson learned! They said because of the time since purchase well I can’t predict that it would fall apart. After all the money I spent with thred up to date I will now go else where.  I understand you can not always know about preowned but please stand behind your products you sell and advertise as like new or gently used !",1
1708,"Horrible Customer Service: I’ve had a few good experiences with ThredUp in the past, but lately there seems to have been several issues with quality, sanitation, and timeliness—not to mention my biggest complaint: customer service that is extremely lacking. Before giving this company any of your money, I strongly encourage you to look them up on the internet, read reviews, and go through the comments on their social media platforms and decide whether you are comfortable with the possibility of being unable to successfully get in touch with customer service should an issue arise.",1
1709,"Very slow: It took months to process my clean out bag and longer to sell. Some of my higher quality items were poorly photographed and didn’t sell. Buying is difficult for the same reasons, it’s hard to trust what you’re buying. I think thredup is a great idea and i hope they continue to do well but i probably won’t order from them or sell to them again. 

It’s been 8 days since i ordered two sweaters and a tshirt and it still hasn’t shipped. They move real slow.",3
1710,Love this app!: They make thrifting easy. Easy to make returns and they even help create less waste by being able to use the same bag from the shipment to return your items. I’ve been shopping on thredup since 2017 and have seen their app improve over the years. Very user friendly and you can filter down if there’s something specific you’re looking for.,5
1711,"Love It: I love this website - having fluctuated sizes myself over the past few years due to pregnancies and Covid quarantines, it’s been quite helpful to not feel so guilty buying all new clothes as I update my wardrobe. Also, I love the VARIETY of styles I find by thrifting! And for my kids? Why would I buy my toddlers brand new clothes?? They get them filthy faster than I can say boo, lol. And thredUP makes it all really easy. Love it, truly!",5
1712,Very Happy Customer: I ordered two items from Threadup and I was very pleased when they came in the mail. They were wrapped in nice tissue paper and just as the website said they were very lightly used. I love both of the items. As a bonus I also received them 1 day earlier than was expected. I will definitely be ordering from Threadup again. I am very happy and can’t wait to wear them.,5
1713,Recent Use: Normally I really enjoy using Thred Up. However most recently I noticed their prices have gotten higher(like retail price or higher) for second hand clothes. Also I sent a bag of my own items which I have done a number of times before without a problem. However I sent this bag and it says it was received back in October and seems to be stuck on received. It’s now December and it hasn’t even been processed. This might be the last time I use the app depending on the outcome of this bag.,3
1714,Obsessed: One thing I hope you can improve is allow user to adjust the order on their saved search page. Also the ability to modify search filters. I might be wrong if they do exist and I couldn’t find it. Another nice feature will be helpful for me is if you can set an secondary email or phone texting notification on your bids etc.,5
1715,"Only place I’m buying clothes from now on.: I’ve made many purchases from them in these last few months. I’ve been satisfied with them all. They don’t lie about the quality. I’ve sent in a clean up kit and am waiting to see how that process goes. The only suggestion I have is more than 2 pictures if possible, especially on items that have obvious marks.",5
1716,Good way to shop more sustainably: I have bought several items and sold a few too and i have been satisfied with most items I purchased. The search feature by size works well. I would like a little more description on items such as washing instructions. It is difficult to tell by the fabric material alone whether something is machine washable. I love my new shawl but it is ‘hand wash and dry flat’ so I’ll machine wash in a lingerie bag and hope for the best ;),4
1717,"Love it, but…: I love thredup! There’s alway deals going on and the clothing I’ve bought is always great condition. I think there’s should be a “my feed” page to look through clothing that is already your style based on things you’ve liked or purchased. Oftentimes when I look things up, I don’t find things that are my style. I find things I like kind of chaotically, but I would buy more frequently if clothing I was likely to wear was right in front of me.",4
1718,"Take my $: Poshmark and Mercari are great, but I’ve gotten AMAZING deals on threadUP. I’ve been able to basically swap out my entire wardrobe for a small fraction of the initial cost and many of the items were brand new. Plus you can bundle for free shipping and you earn points to get additional deals. For holidays there are usually additional sales. They have shoes, but not a ton, but for clothes it’s where it’s at. Happy shopping!",5
1719,"Love it, but issues lately: Love a lot of things about ThredUp! However, there have been discrepancies with prices lately. During the last sale, an item was priced as being 35% off, but then in the same day that item changed to being full price, and changed again to being discounted. Not sure if this is a bug in the system? Also, my cart timer is 4 hours while I notice some items I want being in someone’s cart for 12 hours or longer.",4
1720,"Great!!!just great!!: I’ve never so addicted to a shopping app. The simplicity of the interface, the advanced filtering, the mission of the company especially.  As a small-sized person, I am so satisfied to find out thread up. Great style, great quality, great price! Please let me let me know if you are any new graduate! I’ll be graduating this December from UCLA as a mathematics and economics major, I am deeply interested in e-commerce. I can see myself wearing clothes bought on your app and work for you!",5
1721,"App has some problems: The bargains you find here are wonderful, but the navigation on the app has some problems. They advertise that you can buy gift cards, but I’ve tried to order one several times in the past two days without luck. It says that card is in my cart, but never appears there. There is no way to contact ThredUP to address any problems with purchases, returns or navigation of site. It is frustrating to say the least. They need to straighten out this and other problems before they lose clients.",3
1722,"Obsessed!: ThredUP is taking over my closet! They have amazing deals ALL THE TIME, the app is so easy to use that I end up scrolling for hours. There are so many great options and the best part is, I can purchase numerous items for less than half of what you would pay at other brand stores I’ve also never had a problem with any of the clothes they come exactly as described..it’s been my go to for a few years now. I love it.",5
1723,"Searching and Sorting is Very Glitchy: I find that the Search and Sort features are inconsistent and frustrating. If I narrow the search to the all the specs I need, it either comes out blank and “unfound” or kicks me out of the category all together. And, the specs I put in are not nearly enough to make nothing come up at all. When I use the Search tool, very basic items come up unfound, eg, “khaki skirt.”",5
1724,"Only good for certain things.: I’ve been using this app for a while now. The app itself works on and off. Lately, it hasn’t been loading and when it does load it is incredibly slow. 

Selection wise it is really easy to buy an item that looks great on the app but horrible in person. I bought two items that arrived very different from how they were described. One was not shown/described that it was backless and the other was completely sheer and a different material than what was listed. 

I’ve only been successful in buying specific brands that I already know the quality of.",2
1725,"Love this site/app: I have purchased over 30 items from thred up throughout the last few years. Clothes for myself and children, as well as shoes for myself. I typically only buy items that are new with tags or in excellent condition and they have always been exactly as promised. If I’ve ever had an issue, they were quick and courteous. I tell everyone I know about this site and get so many compliments on my clothes.",5
1726,"Love! Needs some updates but always has good deals.: I’ve purchased quite a few items and been happy most of the time so far. The only item I bought that I was unhappy with was a skirt. Normally I’m a small and thredup doesn’t offer waist measurements for skirts (but it does for pants) so it was wayyyy smaller than anticipated. Please update this! 

They don’t have the *best* return policy but I’m happy with in store credit. If you aren’t I’d caution against buying here unless you’re absolutely sure of the fit and condition.",4
1727,"Impressed: It’s so easy!!  Paying, shipping, shopping. You can find every brand on there!  I shopped Forever 21, H&M, Brandy Melville, Lululemon, Adidas, Champion, even David’s Bridal. All for amazing prices!! I can even send them clothes I don’t want and get paid!  I honestly love this app. If I could critique anything, the presentation of the items is really poor. Some things are wrinkled, misplaced, etc. But that’s really it! You can return things you don’t like and get your money back, super super easy!!",5
1728,"Buying is fine.. selling, not so much: I bought a few items from Thread Up, which was fine. 

I decided to send a bag of clothes to sell. 
While all the items I sent, shirts, jeans and shoes, some brand new, the bag was worth at least $300. I wasn’t expecting $300, but when I received an email that my expected amount would be $30, I was pretty furious. I could sell all that stuff on eBay for double the amount. I was just trying to make the process a little easier. I will buy from thredUP again, but I’ll never send a bag of clothes to sell again.",3
1729,No item measurements: In the past they had item measurements which is great. Just ordering by size and seeing a picture doesn’t ensure that the item will work for you. I think the measurement information is important especially since you can’t try on the item before buying. Unless they give me this piece of information I won’t be ordering from them again. Also customer service was no help.,5
1730,WORST SELLING APP: DO NOT SEND YOUR CLOTHES HERE TO SELL! Unless you feel like sending in a DONATION of clothing because that’s basically what it is. I sent in a giant bag of clothes and most of the items were all BRAND NEW NAME BRAND WITH TAGS never been worn and the one without tags were in perfect condition because they’ve never been worn. I look on the app and they are selling me items for $10 - $40 not to mention many of the items I sent are no where to be found. You know what i’m getting? 23 faking cents to $1.50 for each item. Are you FAKING kidding me? What a complete rip off!!! Do not send these people your clothing. I AM FURIOUS! I hope this place gets sued for every penny they have! Pretty sure my review keeps getting deleted,1
1731,"Many flaws interfere with a great service: I love the idea of thredUP and have had many satisfactory orders and returns and re-orders etc, but their search feature is extremely inadequate for their increasingly large inventory. 

-Why can’t dresses be filtered by sleeve length? Shouldn’t all things with sleeves have that filter option? 
-Brands have too much variability in sizes to make universal “my sizes” useful, would be better if there was an option to specify and save the size you are in specific brands
-Would be great to have an option to exclude search filters ie:”no stripes or wool or orange”",3
1732,"DO NOT CONSIGN WITH THEM: I sent them three pristine designer items, that were steamed and wrapped in tissue paper and was shocked when they were not accepted.  I reached out and asked to have them sent back, since they were expensive items, and I was told that since I did not initially check the box to have unaccepted items returned to me, they could not send them back.  The supposed reason they were rejected: ""items unclean or stained.""  This was a totally lie.  I checked these items meticulously before I sent them.  This company is stealing whatever items they can get away with and there's no way for me to prove it.  All I can do is tell the world not to consign with them.  Consider yourself informed.",1
1733,"Change in measurements: ThredUP has stopped the measuring of the bust and length size of their clothes. When I contacted customer service about it, I was told that I have to check that by search the brand name on google myself. Some of the brands are fake or non existence. I will not buy anything anymore because it’s a waste of time. When you do their length filter, if you’re 5. 8 tall, you will find 34 bust and 34 length categorized in knee length. Really???? No more thredUP. The app is good.",5
1734,"#savingtheplanet: Ever since I found thredUP, I’ve been in love. The app has been awesome. Very User friendly. Always things you can do on a PC you can’t do from the app but so far I’ve had no issues. It was easier to contact customer support through the app. 
I’ve been buying and selling for well over a year now. The app is great. My experience has been great but this year, your PA warehouse has sent out wrong items, items with no invoice, & has had extra long delivery times and I’m not that far.",4
1735,"Read the details: Although the buying part is a great deal, for those selling beware. I was disappointed in this process and there was very little information as to the overall process of how some clothing is accepted and other pieces are not. 

I itemized everything I sent over and not all the my items were listed with no follow up or explanation as to why. More transparency to the selling process would be helpful and provide reality that the return you get on clothing you sell is minimal to zero. There is also no customer service number readily available to contact for further clarification. The concept though great, has a lot of gaps in it that leaves one weary.",1
1736,Secondhand made easy: I love shopping second hand and I love that I can do it online now. I can easily search for great name brands at over half the price sometimes. There are options to turn notifications on when new things are added to your favorite brands so I can always keep up with things. Customer service is fast and returns are easy. There are constantly extra discount offers which I love. I will keep using thredup!,5
1737,"Designer New with tags at insane prices: I’m addicted now. Gorgeous designer clothing - which you can sort for new with tags if consignment or “like new” isn’t your thing - for less than you’ll find anywhere. Quality assurance is great, and as a lover of silk I’m hooked.

The search and sort features as well as filtering is excellent. It’s easy to find something that you can visualize in your head but don’t have a specific piece in mind. Highly recommend!",5
1738,"Love ThredUP: I only shop on thredUP these days.  I have a young child so it's hard to get out and go shopping and try stuff on.  The way things are set up makes it really fun to shop on thredup!  My only complaint is sometimes promo codes will not work or I won't get discount emails I'm supposed to like the Bingo game email I haven't received an update on this week.  But I know the back end of e commerce can get glitchy.  All in all, I love shopping second hand on ThredUP!",5
1739,"Do Not Use This Site: I wish I could give less than 1 star. If you are actually looking to make money off of your clothes DO NOT DO IT HERE!! I sent 20 items—all designers, no stains, no rips—they all fit their “standards” and they only accepted 3 items.... who knows what they even do with the rest. For all I know, the people checking the bag just keep them. Then for the items they would sell, I am getting 15% of what they are selling them for which is basically $4 a piece. And on top of all of this, even though they sold these items I have to wait 14 days to get the money. Their rules and standards are absolutely insane!! You’re better off throwing your clothes in the trash.",1
1740,"Love love love Thred Up: I have been shopping at this site for a year now and I’m still in awe of all the clothes that I find and the price, OMG, you cannot beat the price!  I always get compliments at work and they always ask me where I get my clothes. Now few of my friends and coworkers shop here too.  I love that I find so many beautiful dresses. I love this site and will continue to shop.  Thank you Thred Up for putting such great quality items on your site!!!",5
1741,"Slow: Everything about my thredup experience took longer than expected and/or too long in general. It took longer to get my bag than they said it would. Once I sent it in, it took longer for them to receive acknowledgment than it should have (and I only received acknowledgment via the app once I complained, although they did not respond directly to my complaint). Then processing took longer than I expected (although they had not previously said how long that would take). Then they said I had to wait 14 days to get my cash, and alas, that isn’t true either, still waiting.",2
1742,"Excellent service, great value, and fun to shop!: I love shopping with ThredUp. The variety of items and and prices are great and I love discovering pieces that are new to me that shopping here reduces waste and avoids so much disposable clothing. The mobile app can be buggy sometimes (e.g. slow to load item images, occasional crash when switching filter, not maintaining filters), but these issues haven’t stopped me from using the app and their service or completing purchases.",5
1743,"More options: Thredup makes it possible to get the brands I want (and the quality) at a price that means it’s not one nice top and maybe one pair of shoes, but several tops, pants, shoes, and a necklace! It has ha changed the way I look at clothing shopping - I’m always walking through the mall thinking, “That’s nice, but I can get the same thing on Thredup for much less.” I’ve literally been on the app at the mall looking for the Thredup version of what I’ve wanted....and I always find it!",5
1744,"Easy Way to Make Use of Unused Clothing: Thread Up was a great option for me for both buying and selling. My motivation is primarily to save money on purchases and to reuse when practical to do so. I had no expectation to get really great payouts. Thread Up met my expectations, and are upfront about what to expect. 20 years ago I actually made money buying and selling baby clothes on EBay. This is not the same arrangement, but the convenience that Thread Up offers is worth it for me now.",5
1745,"So far, I've had pretty good luck: I have purchased many items, but have only returned one item...awaiting its arrival to their facility.  One item's size was posted incorrectly, but they promptly refunded full amount.  
I have a couple suggestions about the app, and reserving an item... there should be a time limit on how long someone can hold onto an item in their cart, as well as a wait list for that item if someone decides not to purchase.

I like that there are measurements for pants and tops, but this should also include jackets.

I have not sold to them.  Some other reviewers were not happy with amount they received for their clothing, but if you were going to donate then the amount you receive is extra.

I have had excellent service and if you use app shipping is free.",5
1746,"Disappointed: Originally I thought this was a great idea.... I have purchased items and donated items. On my first purchase I attempted to return some items...... no refund given ..... . which was extremely disappointing given the quality of the clothes returned did not match the description online. Be cautious when purchasing items. They say they are great quality, but the actual product has much more wear and tear .....",5
1747,"Easy, cheap, sustainable buying and selling: Love the convenience of selling. Love the clothing selection and quality for shopping. Prices can’t be beat. Frequent deals. Good loyalty program. Love the bundle shipping feature. Return policy isn’t the best, but they more than make up for that on price. Shipping is slow, but that’s because they are combining your products into one shipment to cut down on shipping waste. I prefer this.",5
1748,"Constantly have to log into app: Starting sometime this year, the app now  forces me to enter my login credentials every single time I open it - even if it’s just an hour later. I don’t think a thrifting app needs the same security level as my banking app? The login UX is so clunky with the email and password form fields on 2 separate screens – which means I can’t utilize apple keychain or faceID until I manually type in my email and get to the 2nd screen each time. Can’t it at least remember my email?! Such an annoying barrier to entry, I hardly bother using the app anymore.",2
1749,"4.5 stars but i actually ordered: so i ordered my cart three times so far but the second time i did they didnt ship my stuff until two weeks later lol its about to be three weeks and it still hasnt arrived- until friday but we tried reaching out to the seller AKA thred up, but no response because the inly way to reach out is through email.🙂Other than that ordeal the clothes are great and true to size cheap and some still have the tags on!",4
1750,"A headache at best: The process is not seamless, customer service lags and the automated questions are extremely repetitive.
Items on the site are not organized properly, photos are not accurate or lack necessary details.
Definitely a better place for a shopper than a seller, you don’t get much for what you turn in unless it hasn’t been worn and has a big brand name which why use this when there are other sites that offer you more of the money for the product?

I have earned credit and will those, but once they are used up I will be closing my account and getting ride of this app",1
1751,"Return widow is short.: I love Thread up, but the return policy has a small window. In my case, I have a pair of shoes that are clearly two different sizes. Unfortunately, I didn’t wear them right away, so I didn’t know until after the 14 day return window had passed. I’ll post a picture. It’s comical/sad. One of the shoes isn’t even marked inside as to the size. Just be aware! Try everything on and don’t delay!",5
1752,"Love this App: I love using ThredUP! It’s thrifting but you can look up exactly what your searching for, verses running all over the thrift store to find that one piece. If something does not work out,  well returns  are easy and free besides the 1.99 item restocking fee. (which I would say does not bother me)
I would highly recommend using this app you save money, find quality clothing and reduce your carbon footprint.",5
1753,Almost 5 stars: I’m loving the app but so far it’s not allowed me to connect to my existing account that I had before the app. For some reason the app defaults only to my Appleid email and won’t let me change it. I’ve reached out to thred up customer service and hope we can resolve this minor issue. Otherwise I’m loving the ease and convenience of this app and company. I love reusing clothing and not buying new. I love the ease of (almost) free returns. Quality is above average for consignment. It’s my new favorite way to shop!,4
1754,"Horrible if you need help: My order still shows nothing after being ordered two weeks ago. I keep trying to get in contact with customer support and either the app won’t load or let me use the customer support option or I have been ignored. I made a $150 order and have no idea where it is and am getting no help the creators clearly have no interest in customer satisfaction.
Update: my order has now said processing for multiple days and customer support still won’t respond on app. I wish I would’ve just tried thrift stores around me at least I would’ve gotten the cloths I payed for.",1
1755,"Great app!: Love what ThredUP is doing to help recycle and reuse.  We could use more of that mindset in this world.  

Just a side note though...the measurements are not usually accurate.  It’s like someone didn’t want to be bothered to actually have to measure each item, so they just plastered on general measurements that they assigned for that specific size (I most often see this with the bust or waist measurement).  I’ve seen it too many times for it to be a coincidence.  As long as you are familiar with the brand’s sizing, you’ll do great and LOVE it!!",4
1756,"Horrible Experience: I have used ThreadUp in the past and had reasonable experiences but this last experience has been awful!

I sent 18 pairs of shoes in my last clean out bag - seven of which were brand new with soles that were pristine and many in the factory wrappings. I have pictures of all of them. None of them showed any sign of wear. Imagine my surprise when five of these brand new pair of shoes were not accepted when the other shoes with more wear were. These new shoes disappeared and I did not receive any payment for them. When I asked for an explanation, I was told that all five of these brand new shoes encountered “wear’ in the box. 

On top of this, one of the brand new pair of shoes (sent with original wrappings) that was accepted and was the first to sale - simply disappeared from the site - and again I did not receive any payment for them.

I will leave it up to future sellers to derive their own conclusions as to what is happening here but I would be cautious about what I sent for consignment.",1
1757,"This site is disappointing: The ""evaluations"" are done by people who probably want the clothes. I am curious as to how much of what they reject is actually donated and how much of the items sold are bought by the evaluators for the lowest price they can get away with. They received lightly worn Coach shoes that they priced at $30 (originally $300). I sent two Coach bags which were barely used and I was told they were deemed to be too damaged to sell. I protested and they gave me a credit of $130 as a courtesy(?!!!). 

Don't send anything that is really nice to them. They are creative at best and potentially criminal at their worst in their processes.",2
1758,Not again: I mainly ordered from here for a pair of shorts that were refunded because they couldn’t find them. Okay fine. I received a pair of not refundable shorts that were claimed to have been just faded okay but why isn’t the fact that their stretched out on there has well.  I also was out another pair of shorts that was said to be in the box of a package but they weren’t and there’s been no reply though they sent an email saying to email at any time.  Until there’s an issue. And even their automated response is a bunch of sound good nothing.  If you could answer the actual email I’ve sent about this instead of worrying about looking good. You clearly don’t.,1
1759,"Poor service: I’ve ordered a bunch of things from thredup. Two of them have been fine, but other items have come in a different size than the size advertised and others have had so little/poor descriptions that what came were not at all what I was expecting. Most frustrating of all is a totally lack of being able to get in touch with anyone. It took so many back and forth emails that I just gave up and decided to cut my losses. I would rate more highly, even despite their problems, if I could get easily get in touch with their service when things go wrong.",2
1760,"Great  place to Shop!: Love to Shop here! Enjoy all the items I buy from here.  If you know your pant, Jean, Top, Blouse, Size, just make sure to check each item to see if they run small, true to size, or larger. Each item lets you know it’s measurements. I’m beyond pleased! Makes shopping a Wonderful experience all at the connivence of your fingertips. If you give it a try, you might be surprised! Plus, save a lot of money...Who doesn’t like that?",5
1761,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this site/app!!!: I cannot stress enough how much I love this site/app!  Between the prices, quality, convenience, fast delivery, and user friendliness, this is by far my favorite place to shop for clothes now.  I buy just about all of my 3yr old and my own clothes from here.  I’ve even purchase some of my 19yr old son’s clothes here too.  I love this site so much that I recommend this site to everyone I can.  I may even have a little addiction to it too, lol!",5
1762,"I’m not getting payed for the items I sold.: Had no issue using stripe to receive my 1st few payouts, now in 2019 I made a withdraw using stripe and my payout is magically lost, after 2 weeks there is no resolution. $200 vanished. Thread up is blaming stripe and stripe is blaming thread up. The fees associated with both companies are way to high for me to be experiencing any of these issues. The waiting period for my money to even be available as a seller is close to 15 days then an issue like this happens where thread up can’t stand behind there banking system. Definitely disappointed. Will no longer sell to thread up, and might possibly have to have the BBB involved to recoup my lost deposits. Beware.",1
1763,"More designers to choose from: Love the company, but I dislike sifting through fast fashion brands to find ethically made and designer clothing that I like. Whenever I try and search for certain designers, most of them aren’t listed. Sometimes when searching for a brand I like the site adds fast fashion brands with similar names to the page. I wish there was more of a focus on sustainability instead of promoting the big fast fashion brands that are harming the planet just because they’re second hand.",4
1764,"Awesome App with Awesome Finds!: I love how seamless and straightforward this app is! I love shopping from ThredUP; I easily find brands and clothing I’ve bought before, but can’t find in the stores anymore. It is such a great way to find suitable clothes for great deals! Plus, recycled clothing is a lot better for the environment, too! ThredUP does a great job of finding pieces that are of decent quality and still have a lot of life left to them ;)",5
1765,"Easy to use, great products, save the planet!: I buy most of my clothing from thredup now. When I see something cute online, 9.5 times out of 10 i can find it or similar enough on thredup and save a ton of money, not to mention stay eco-friendly. The app is great, super easy to use. I love the rewards I get as a VIT too eg coupons for discounts and free shipping. I tell all my friends about it.  Thanks ThredUp team!",5
1766,"User friendly: The app is really easy to use. I hardly ever run into issues with it. The selection of clothes is ENORMOUS. The best part is how easy returns are. They provide measurements, but it’s always a little bit of a guessing game to know how something will actually fit you when you’re buying secondhand, but it’s really easy with thredUP to send something back if it doesn’t work out.",5
1767,"Everything ALWAYS fits perfectly!: I have ordered dozens of dresses and tops from ThreadUp, and I am always pleasantly surprised by how flattering the clothing is on me. I don't know what their system of measurements are (mostly because I haven't checked, there IS a button that says ""how we measure""), but I prefer to get my clothes here if I am buying online, because they are discounted, like-new, and perfect for my body type!",5
1768,"Slow Shipping, but overall good stuff: Pros: The app is user friendly. The deals are good. Most items are described accurately. The packaging is cute. 

Cons: ThredUp is missing the mark on shipping in comparison to Poshmark or DePop. Shipping is stupid slow. It takes several days to get items from one warehouse to another so items can be shipped together. This severely delays shipping times and I can’t imagine ThredUp is coming out even on shipping costs. 

The pictures are not great in the sense that you can’t really see flaws, wear and tear, or damaged and have to rely on the descriptions heavily.  

Overall not a bad place to get used stuff. Shipping needs to be improved. For this reason, I generally choose other companies unless I absolutely can’t find what I’m looking for and ThredUp happens to have it.",4
1769,"All of my clothes come from here now!: Literally the best! Great quality, awesome prices with unbelievable sales. The rewards points keep me coming back. The only tiny downside is shopping can be a “little” slow when you order multiple items because they transfer the items from different places but that’s a small price to pay!",5
1770,"Not happy today: I’ve bought many things here and have loved most of them. 
Today I didn’t. Not because I didn’t like the garment I did however it arrived with pretzel pieces in the pocket along with a lip balm and the zipper on said pocket is broken.  
This is most unusual. I will continue to be a good customer. I’ve gotten many great buys however the Quality control needs to be improved",5
1771,"My fav shopping place: I absolutely love ThredUp! Not only THE place to find your favorite outfits, shoes and accessories at unbeatable prices, it also has great deals for your kids or grandkids. They will let you ship your better clothes for free to them so someone else can enjoy them later (while you earn some perks like free shipping or $10 off) but you also help to make this world a greener place.",5
1772,This is everything you could want and more: Do you know how frustrating it is to be 5’1” and buy pants online? Every manufacturer has a different idea of what dimensions belong to size M or 4 vs 6 it’s insanity. This place has the measurements of every pair of pants - waist  inseam RISE?! I mean they do that for tops too?! And this is a SECOND hand store?! Amazing. Literally everything you could ever want from online clothes shopping — PERIOD.,5
1773,Be Careful with Luxury Purchases: My first purchase on the thredUP app was a fantastic experience. The items that I purchased were luxury goods and they were very carefully packaged. Unfortunately every time after that was filled with disappointment  I purchased more luxury goods from thredUP and was very dissatisfied in the packaging and care taken in shipping. Purchased a rare limited edition Louis Vuitton and it was only packaged in a thin plastic mail bag NO box. On more than one occasion I have emailed the company with absolutely no response. If you’re looking for a company to buy consignment luxury goods I would look elsewhere.,2
1774,"Love it!: I’ve replaced, and definitely upgraded, almost my entire wardrobe. Website is incredibly organized and easy to navigate. 

Occasionally I’ll need to return an item. Very simple process!

I’m addicted!  So much fun to browse through all the items. I’m always finding new designers. Also—great prices, especially when they have sales (which is quite often)!",5
1775,"Very happy with this app: Once the pandemic hit, I no longer felt safe to shop for clothes at my local thrift stores, which is what I usually do when we need clothes. I came across this when it was mentioned in a news article. I’ve made three orders over the past several months and I am very happy with my experience. Sustainability is very important to me and my family, and I am so glad to have this option!",5
1776,"Great finds: Great stuff always. Be aware when shopping they sometimes list items, mulitpke times within the same department and prices can vary from posting to posting. Ie; same dress with exact same description and display image but can be listed at a higher or lower price. Hmm. 
Sometimes the description of each item is grossly incorrect BUT because of that error I’ve made out even better on a purchase price.  
Good shipping and returns.",4
1777,"Almost great!: It’s pretty awesome how I can find so much amazing clothes of various kinds. 
A few quibbles though: 
-Why can’t I look for slippers and robes? They are labeled as other things that they aren’t. 
-Why when the app suggests I search for similar items to something I’ve liked but has sold does it forget my sizes? Showing me size five shoes when I can only wear 8 1/2 isn’t going to create a new sale. 
-Why can’t I have both women’s and juniors sizes as my saved sizes showing up simultaneously? Women’s and juniors sizing is pretty arbitrary. I’d see more and want more, no?",3
1778,"Amazing!!: Every single thing I have purchased has been absolutely perfect! And even a rare few that I didn’t love, the return process is super simple and stress free. I was nervous the sizing or item description wouldn’t be accurate but everything was spot on! So impressed! I’ve been able to save tons on name brands AND feel good about buying second hand & recycling! The only thing I’m upset about is not finding out about this sooner!",5
1779,Buying 👍🏻 selling 👎🏻: ThredUP has much better selection than the competing online thrift stores. Lots of great items to choose from at excellent prices. Including free shipping and promo codes available. My only complaint was that I got a very low amount (not enough to even cover shipping) when selling. All items sold for a total of well over $100 yet I only received $11 credited toward shipping,5
1780,"Please help..: If you download this app and or start buying YOU will need help, you won’t know how to stop. I’m in LOVE with this online store, it has sooo many cute stuff, not to mention the great prices, the outlet part of the store. You get points which You can trade in for different things like, free shipping, 10$ off. I’ve literally had this app for about two weeks or 3 weeks and I’ve spent like 200$ like 🤔 I need help because this is so addictive....",5
1781,"Hidden treasures!: You have to look through a lot of stuff to find the treasures hidden in ThredUp’s listings, but that’s a fun diversion in itself.  I’ve found some beautiful, unique items at great prices.  Be sure to check out the measurements, though - sizing varies from brand to brand, and I’ve looked at some garments that were supposedly my size, but the measurements told a different story. Like a real thrift shop, you never know what you’re going to find!",5
1782,"Size and quality hit or miss: The size measurements aren’t always correct which translates to either a loss (final sales) or a return (charged for “re-stocking”). In addition, I’ve often received items that were either ripped, had holes in them, or once an entire order of bags was covered in glitter and therefore unusable (all final sale items and none of the bags had glitter so it’s unclear why they should be covered in it). 

I still use the app and take my chances on occasion but I’m much more cautious now and don’t shop here very often at all anymore.",3
1783,"Not a good deal for an ordinary shopper: I have a lot of clothes in my closet, but most of my items are NOT a super fancy brand. I sent in five nice items. I made $1.89 for my leather pants. Everything else sat there until the timeframe expired. If I want to get any of my items back, I buy them just like any other shopper. No deals, no discounts AND I still pay shipping. There’s an option to pay more to have your items returned if they don’t sell, but I opted out because it didn’t seem worth it. Ponder this before you send your clothes in. I get that they have to make money, but I’ll just go back to giving my clothes to a local thrift store that helps my community instead.",1
1784,NO LONGER UPFRONT PAYOUT: It’s important to note that ThredUP no longer provides an upfront payout. It used to be where they would give you the option for them purchase items you sent in upfront and therefore provide you with a payout. Not a great deal of money but at least something. Now it is TOTAL consignment and you receive a payout ONLY if your item sells. If it doesn’t sell then your items are recycled and you are left with nothing. You currently receive on average 5-9% of what the item finally sells at and that is less if they offer a 20% off sale.,3
1785,"I GAVE IT 5 STARS but now...: My first order went smoothly with no hassle. The items on my cart are saved only for 24 hours. I have been trying to check out since last night, and it would just leave me on a blank loading page. I’ve waited several minutes (12 at the most) multiple times. Nothing. It’s extremely frustrating right now. Please help. Just trying to buy stuff. 🤦🏽‍♀️",5
1786,"Don’t sell- Drop your stuff at a battered women’s shelter if you want to make a difference.: I was a frequent shopper until I decided to order my own “clean out” bag. Pretty much gave them my closet for $12. I’m used to selling to Buffalo Exchange, and understand that payouts aren’t much, but that was disappointing. If you really want to make a difference drop your family’s clothes and accessories off at a battered women’s shelter. I expected to make enough to at least afford one or two items, and you know, continue the recycling. Can’t say I’m not resentful when I’m scrolling through my favorite brands and see the mark ups.",2
1787,"Amazing customer service!: I have ordered from here many, many times and never have I been disappointed. Of course, as with any online shopping, sometimes things just don’t fit right and that’s just how it goes. But I’ve purchased from thredUp, sold items, donated items and returned items and never had a bit of complication. Would definitely recommend! Especially for kids clothes 😍",5
1788,Amazing: I has a very specific dress in mind - which I had not seen anywhere but existed perhaps only in my mind. ThredUp had it! In my size! Along with so many other items I love. Condition of items so far is exactly as stated. And their customer service is second to none! (I made an error and they fixed it!) Sending some of my items back to them because I need more room for my incoming ThredUP finds! My daughter doing great bargains too. Love ThredUP.,5
1789,"4 out of 5: I love thredUP. The app is easy to use, the clothing I’ve received is great, the customer support is incredible and I love that they’re trying to promote sustainable second hand clothing. BUT my issue is that prices have drastically increased. Why would I pay more for a second hand pair of shoes or shirt from old navy when I can go to my local store and buy them brand new for less? There’s little incentive anymore to purchase second hand.",5
1790,"Love it!: I needed to update my wardrobe and I love that the app keeps my sizes and my favorites! The polka dotted boxes and tissue paper make it an extra treat to receive. I haven’t returned anything yet but they provide a print out with instructions in each package. I also have dressier clothes than the local resale shops will take so this will hopefully be a great way to barter those for new clothes. Overall, I highly recommend them!",5
1791,"Yes! Yes! Yes!: Seriously I love this site! I try to be responsible with my spending but keeping up with current fashion and buying the things I really like took a toll on my bank account. I have gotten some of the best, most current looks in my closet from this site. Measurements are always accurate, photos show all the details and honestly no different hen buying something online or boring from a girlfriend. I love telling people about this site. Don’t hesitate! ❤️",5
1792,"Not good for selling: When I first started using Thread Up I got a decent payout.  Everything I send in is usually brand new or barely used.  Customer service is terrible.  I tried contacting them when my bag was ruined in an accident.  I never got a response after making two attempts.  The last bag I sent in was full of brand new items, several with tags still.  After taking longer than normal to process they didn’t offer very much payout.  I’m not looking to recoup the total amount of money I paid for new items but I didn’t think they would rip me off and keep a majority of the profits they make on my stuff.  I highly recommend not using Thread Up.",1
1793,"Love!: I absolutely love this app and store.  90 %, of my wardrobe is threadup.  I don’t see myself shopping for clothes anywhere else for the rest of my life . Everything I’ve get look beautiful!  I started by going into my closet and stores to find out what my size was in the brands that I love, once I knew that, it was on to building my wardrobe on thread up.  I’m always on the app in my cellphone the deals are soo good!!!!",5
1794,"My Go To Store: The store is absolutely fantastic! I am a tall but slender woman and I have such an issue just getting a pair of jeans I like that are long enough which makes shopping in stores an impossible task. Not anymore!!! I’m in “long Heaven”! There are so many options available, the easiest way to shop, unbelievable prices, easy to use app and numerous rewards which makes it perfect!",5
1795,"I love everything except…: Really nice clothes at great prices. The clean out is so quick and easy! The packaging they use makes getting your order feel like an event.
Plus size women should never, ever order skirts! They confuse plus sizes with teen sizes and almost every one I’ve purchased has been wrong and a total waste of money.
If I had the time for returns I wouldn’t be shopping online in the first place.
With that exception I’m 100% happy.",4
1796,Stealing: I’ve sent two kits in recently and each one had items taken from them that were not included in my clean out kit and not returned to me. This is so infuriating and not cool. It’s been two months trying to get help from customer service. I spend too much money on this site to be dealing with this. It’s making me not want to purchase from the site any more.,5
1797,"Stick to other apps: I made a big leap in ordering 15 sweaters/blazers/jackets. Of the adult sizing 1 came as a child’s size, 2 petite, and 3 with many stains. The pictures and descriptions are quite favorable for what you get. Most of my items were listed as little to no sign of wear-one was misshapen from shrinking and another sweater had so many pills it looks too used to wear. Even with items labeled wrong on their behalf, they want $11 to ship back. I will stick to eBay and Mercari where listing details are more accurate and honest and the seller is protected with free shipping. For the price I paid I was thinking I was getting some very nice items.",1
1798,"Clean Outs and Shopping: I’ve been a ThredUP customer for approximately three years.  Until this year I’d never done a clean out with them.  Thus far I’ve sold almost 20 items.  My payout:  $0.00, not a penny. Won’t do that again.

I’ve also shopped with them.  My most recent purchase included a blouse with ink stains on the back. These were not visible in any of the pictures. The items as they are represented online are not necessarily the way they are received. 

I think I’ll just stick with Poshmark.  At least I’ve seen a profit with the items I’ve sold.",2
1799,"Poor quality items: When thread up first began the quality of items they accepted was outstanding! But every-time i buy now i receive ratty, stained, or items  are not as described or even how they look in the photos! I even had a credit disappear that they put on my account from when i was returning few items and they offered to give me a partial refund to keep them. Went onto my account and s couple weeks later its gone. Messaged several time about items and never get a response! Thread up",2
1800,"Love thred up!!!: This is so well done!  You can sort by size, color, brand… and so many great deals + good for the planet. I regularly get my kids clothes from this site - and especially their dress clothes are a steal (lots of options sorting “like new”).  For myself, it’s a little hard to order based on just photos (especially because I’m harder to fit), but it’s cheap or free to return items.",5
1801,"Not easy to shop: I would love to find my favorite jeans on thread up but they make it impossible. There’s very few photos and sparse descriptions. A lot of jeans have style names almost all have style numbers or identifying info on tags. It’s hard to find the right fit and women know it’s not all about the measurements!! 
Suggestions are ignored. The fees and returns cost makes shopping guesswork not worth the risk. I would think resale would be a great option to replace my fav items they don’t carry in stores anymore but ThredUP misses that opportunity because they won’t type a few more words or share a tag photo. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",1
1802,"Pleased with purchases/sales: Have sold items and made purchases and am pleased with both. Do wish that more items had more complete descriptions - is material thick or thin? Is it a button or zip closure in this jeans? Is material sheer? Is that front closure on the dress sewn or open? Too often the very brief description leaves the buyer unsure of the purchase. Fortunately, returns are easy. Love telling friends about my recycled purchases.",5
1803,"Only place I shop: I’ve been was so fortunate when I stumbled across this app, I had moved to Florida with nothing and needed to build my wardrobe back up. I’d say the amount I spent was a fraction of what I would have spent anywhere else… even Goodwill! I’ve never had to return anything, but it seems pretty easy if I had to. I’ve earned money by sending my own clothes in for a CLEANUp. Thank you Threadup",5
1804,"Best Retail App EVER!!: So I don’t have to leave my bed & enter the general public to thrift? YES! YES! YES! Not only is this app really terrific with filtering out your sizes but also if you have a color/pattern specific wardrobe you can customize all these options to literally better find pieces to personalize YOUR closet….I also very much LOVE the amazing deals that are always going on. ThreadUp is everything, eco-conscious & sustainable, affordable, and absolutely incredible!!",5
1805,"It takes forever: I mailed a bag at the end of May, they haven’t processed it yet! It’s Nov 30th.  They said it was in transit from May till August.  That’s ridiculous.  I understand what’s going on in the world but you can’t even get a phone number or email to talk to a real person in real time.  I really wanted to like this store but I gave them really nice clothes and I could have donated them or passed them along.",5
1806,"I love this app!: I started using ThredUp a couple of months ago and I am addicted!  They have constant sales and so many things to scroll through.  I love all the filters and every time I say I wish I could sort by something I realize I can!  I wish I didn’t have to pay a restocking fee, but I have already earned enough points to wave that on an order if I want.  I am so excited to have a new wardrobe at such an affordable price!",5
1807,"App is unusable right now: I don’t know what’s going on with this app. Every time I open the app, it won’t load. I have to uninstall it and then reinstall to get anything done.

My phone is up to date, and I know my version is up to date because I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall it about 30 times to place/track my order. Same thing is happening on my iPad, so I know it isn’t my phone. Happens everywhere I go, on every network. So it’s an issue with the app.

I wrote to tech support and heard nothing back. Once my order arrives and I do whatever returns are necessary, I won’t be using this app again until this glaring issue is fixed.",1
1808,Improvement idea: I love browsing and shopping the app with ease. The concept is fabulous. The search and filtering out does similar competitors. I do have a recommendation for improvement. Better measurement sizing is requested for all items and more photos please. What I love about DePop and Poshmark is that I can see more of the item and read better descriptions. Examples like “this item says 8 but measures more like a modern 4.” or sellers adding additional photos of the label.,5
1809,"Good, but harder to find items than on other apps: Prices are usually better here than on Poshmark (or other apps) but searching is harder. You can’t really search for descriptions (like “overalls dress” — it would just be lumped into “casual dress” on ThredUP) so if you’re looking for a TYPE of garment it’s hard to find it. Items are just categorized by color and brand, but not really any specifics/keywords so it takes a TON of sifting through results to find an item. It’s nice you can return things (minus restock fee) so it’s a little less risky than buying off Poshmark.",3
1810,"Prices and items are great BUT: I have been with Thredup since 2017. I purchased several items and then ordered a cleanout bag. I was very pleased to have sold my items for a total of $22+. Last year I sent in another cleanout bag with approximately the same type and quality items. My sales proceeds were $10+. 

Okay. That was still better than what I would get just donating them. 

So this spring I sent in another cleanout bag with similar to better quality items along with a pair of brand new Toms espadrilles (value $100). You can imagine my shock when I received sales proceeds of $2.68 AND my new Toms espadrilles were never listed or shown on my account. 

My daughter had the same type of experience with the declining payouts of same quality items. 

I’m not recommending selling your items on Thredup. Just purchase whatever you find you like. 

Feeling a bit ripped off",3
1811,"Customer service has died: A couple months ago I loved this website. The customer service was fantastic and I was able to get replies with in hours. Now, I can’t get a reply from them at all. I have missing items from a shipment and no one will get back to me. Been trying to contact them multiple times over the past two weeks. I hope it’s just a phase in the company and not a permanent issue. My advice, for now, be cautious of what you’re getting. Because if items are missing and your credit bill is due, best of luck getting a refund with no active customer support.",2
1812,"OBSESSED: I started using ThredUP in November 2018. It has absolutely saved my life. I’ve learned to navigate the app so I am notified when my favorite brands come in and always know how to score all the good deals. My closet has grown more in the last couple months than it has in the last year. It’s always so fun getting a polka dot box or envelope and appreciate the prices being so amazing. I can actually afford to have a nice closet now. Thank you, ThredUP! #chooseused",5
1813,They don’t pay you what they say: After reading all the reviews I wish I had read them before I sent clothes. I kept a very detailed record of everything and what they said I’ll get paid. They don’t pay you a whole lot which I get they have to make money and pay their workers. I’m upset because they didn’t pay me what they said. When I got my payment I would record it just to find out they didn’t pay me the whole amount. For example instead of paying me $4.50 they only paid me $3.60. That $4.50 was what I was told after it was bought and after the person decided not to return it. About half of my bag was like that.,1
1814,Great Option: I have used Thread Up for a long time and love it. I can find the best deals and cutest clothes. It takes the stress of having to search for for other previously owned clothing stores.  The only criticism I have is that sometimes the sizing is off. I am a size 12 and there have been a few purchases that were too small. Regardless of this i have told many friends about  thread up. I will continues endorsing this store.,5
1815,Still has a lot of issues for sellers: I am a fairly regular seller on thredup and one major flaw that thredup has is their cart policy. I have multiple items then sit in carts for days and often weeks because they allow items to stay in carts for 24 hours. I have found that there are many “buyers” that place these items in their carts over and over again as soon as their 24 hours is up. That policy makes it impossible for other people who may be interested in actually purchasing the item to do so. People should NOT be allowed to place items in their carts over and over again and this policy should be re-examined.,1
1816,"What’s not to love??: I have one true addiction in this life and thredup is it. I love shopping and not having to worry about whether the brand is exploiting labor somewhere. Their customer service is GREAT as well, I’ve contacted them a handful of times over the years and they’re always honestly so nice and really helpful, opposite of the normal bot experience. Quality control is really good across the board. It’s fun, just do it!",5
1817,Don’t bother to try and sell anything: Not a very good experience trying to sell my items. They did not scan one of my bags upon receipt so I had no idea if received until I finally saw it posted. It took 8 weeks to process!  Your items are listed for only a short time. If you want them back you have to pay for it. Payout is pathetic. If you want to try and sell something please go somewhere else. They are probably raking in the cash on your leftover items. I still see items of mine out there. The only upside is it is not going in the trash (I hope) but who knows with this company.,1
1818,Favorite place to shop: I love to shop on Thredup. I have saved so much and received high end clothing for a fraction of the price. The only draw back is I wish some of the items had more of a description . For instance wallets only pictured from the outside and shoes only pictured from front and side not bottom. Also all the coats and jackets don’t provide measurements as to chest and length. If it wasn’t for those things I would give a five star rating.,4
1819,Disappointed: ThredUP has turned into an online Plato’s closet: you get Pennies for what you send in and you see things of lower quality in the shop when they reject nicer items you sent. Asking for $15 for a clean out kit is ridiculously steep from my experiences with them. The reward point system changes are not impressive. And ever since Covid they are unable to sort clean out kits in a timely manner. I used to enjoy being able to feel better about using their service vs others to get rid of clothes but it’s no longer worth it.,2
1820,What Deals!!!!: I am so happy that I discovered the site for shopping! Instead of spending approximately $800 for two bags that I wanted I got them on this site for a combination of $55!!!! They just came in the mail and they are stunning and I could not tell if anyone has ever used them there is no imperfections! Thank you so much to this company and what efforts they are making to help our environment. 😍,5
1821,"Could be better: Some great stuff but clunky to use. Filters don’t work well (eg if I filter by sleeve length to find a t-shirt with long sleeves, I still get ones with short sleeves). Also the cart could use a ‘sort by type’ function so I can see all the similar items together instead of needing to scroll up and down to find them. Clothing sizes are very hit and miss. A pair of jeans can be listed as size 12 when it has a 28” waist, as can a pair with a 36” waist. I wish they sized clothes more consistently.",3
1822,"So disappointed with customer service.: I have tried for months to get a human response for an incorrect order. I can’t get assistance. I ordered four pieces, and my order came but with a pair of jeans in a size I’ve never worn. The items I ordered are lost somewhere I guess. Or somebody who wanted those jeans have four pieces they didn’t want. I’m so disappointed because I used to order frequently from ThredUP, from when they first started, and liked the company and their mission. Not anymore. I’ve given up. I will tell my friends to stop using them, too, because now they appear to be too big to care.",1
1823,"Zero customer service, poor descriptions, avoid: Purchased a purse on EBay from Thread Up, the reviews are pretty bad, many people receiving either incorrect item or poor description and how no one contacts them, but I thought, they can’t get a black leather purse wrong, but yes they did, black in the description, arrived 10 days later, and it’s blue, not a cheap purchase either, $86 for something that I definitely wouldn’t have ordered in blue, emailed, messaged, literally no response, check out the reviews before you spend your money. Terrible customer service, need to hire someone to to reply to your poor customers.",1
1824,"Not delivered: The shipping used by this is very unreliable - my shipment was marked lost on delivery day, and now shows that it never left the state it shipped from. I ordered almost 2 weeks before my event, and still won’t have my ThredUP order in time. ThredUP says there was a scanning error in shipping that caused delays - but regardless of what happened, they left me shopping for 2 other dresses on the day of my event after I’d paid them to ship me the dresses I wanted.

Update: they asked me to give them a second try, and they can’t figure out how to ship my second order either",2
1825,"Long time shopper, first time reviewer: I’ve been with ThredUP for years and have been consistently impressed by them! Most of my closets consists of consigned clothing from this amazing online marketplace. I have, on only two occasions, had an issue and it was resolved immediately. Customer service is above and beyond. Love giving clothes a second chance at life, helping earth, and incredible prices.",5
1826,"Beware of returning items: I have bought about $800-$1000 inn clothes, shoes all Coach & purses/ wallets were all name brand. The first box with the shoes I’m so excited about, weren’t in box! Someone had to have taken them an put in a pair of ugly brown shoes not my size/style. Customer service said sorry must have been lost somewhere. Well I think I should be reimbursed for the expensive items I’ve now spent hundreds of $$$ they gave me $1.99 per item For each thing no matter how much I pd! I think that’s stealing. I have papers proving everything they need shut down or something",2
1827,"Customer service is TERRIBLE: I sent some items in to be sold on consignment. Some of them didn’t sell within the 90 days, so I chose to have them sent back to me. My package says it was delivered but never arrived. I’ve tried to talk to customer service about this 4 times over 3 weeks, but I keep getting kicked out of the chat service. The one time I did get a human to email me, she sent me one email asking for the tracking number and then immediately marked my problem as resolved. I’m never getting those items back. I’ve used thredUP for 6 years, and this is the final straw. I won’t be using it again.",1
1828,Inlove with this app!: I absolutely love the clothes selection. It’s convenient and they come straight to my door. Plus I love I can send in my old clothes and whatever they can sell I get store credit for or you get a percentage of what they make off the clothing. The only thing that could use improvement is the speed of shipping.. other than that though I recommend the app!,5
1829,"Just wanted a shipping label :-/: So I tried to request a shipping label to send items versus waiting for the bag and also to reuse a box. However, I never received the mailing label and every time I tried to go to the link it only let me request a new bag. I now have 3 bags coming to me apparently just trying to get a mailing label. On top of that I couldn’t get through to customer service and the chat feature just kept going in circles, without ever answering my question on how to just get a mailing label. I’ve never shopped at thredUP and certainly don’t think I will with everything I’ve gone through just to send them items.",1
1830,"They’ve changed: They used to be awesome. Since expanding over the years, I’ve had trouble with their site and app, issues with placing an order and then days after paying for it they cancel the order, waiting over a week for things to ship, and frustrations with their new policies. For example, they now charge $1.99 restocking fee for returns, but they almost never have accurate measurements available? How is that set up for customer success? 6 months to process a clean out bag? Be good to your customers and they will be loyal to you.",2
1831,"Excellent!!: I have been using ThredUP for years now and have not been disappointed! If something doesn’t fit or work the return process is easy. The prices cannot be beaten, because who doesn’t like food quality clothes for lower prices!! I 100% recommend to anyone. I have told all my friends about this and am so excited that they all love it as much as I do!",5
1832,"Best app I own!: I am addicted to thredUP!  I have purchased many items and I love every one of them.  The cost is a fraction of what I would spend at the store and I am getting some of my favorite brands/looks.  This has proven to be a great way to spice up my wardrobe!  Items come in a very timely manner, and I look forward to getting familiar with all they offer.  I have yet to sell anything but will be looking to do that in the near future...",5
1833,"A great way to shop second hand: I buy most of my clothes through thredUP these days. I love that the carbon footprint significantly reduces in an item once it has been purchased secondhand. I have bought a couple of items that didn’t fit as I had hoped, but my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. I also love that I can buy like-new items that are generally outside of my price range, at a fraction of the cost!",5
1834,"Great concept, AWFUL service, terrible execution/returns: Much as I love this idea, almost every purchase has had problems - items missing, defective items, etc. And Thredup service is THE WORST. Returns are a nightmare. No service to communicate with to deal with these things AND then you get charged and have to chase them down for your refund. I’m always torn about shopping here. You waste so much time.",5
1835,"So far so good: This is a fun way to expand your wardrobe and shop sustainably while being mindful of your budget. Plus with Covid, I don’t really want to go out more than necessary so this allows me to shop in the comfort of my own home.  Do I love everything they send? No. But I keep a couple of pieces from every box and their customer service has been great so far. You can email them and tell them what you’d like to receive and they do deliver. Definitely recommend trying it.",4
1836,"Love ThredUP!!!: Most of my wardrobe is from ThredUP at this point. I love love love this app! They could possibly make their search criteria a bit more detailed so you can find things easier, but all in all, I highly recommend. I have a beautiful wardrobe and paid a third the price I should have for it, and I didn’t contribute to the extreme pollution the textile industry is responsible for. Try this app today, ladies and moms! I have also gotten my son a whole new wardrobe!",5
1837,"Never Will Buy Brand New Again: I LOVE ThredUP. I would say 75% of my closet is from them now. Everything has arrived on time and the quality and fit is as described. I have been able to build my work closet and boho wardrobe without spending $1000s on name brands such as Banana Republic, White House Black Market, and J. Crew or Free People. It also makes me feel good because I’m shopping second hand so it’s greener for the environment.",5
1838,"Got me looking fly for the low: You can find everything on this app for a fraction of the retail price. Updating my summer wardrobe cost me $200 for 41 quality pieces of clothing. I don’t particularly care to spend money on business attire, but you can find quality blazers for less than $10. I basically quit shopping anywhere else for clothes, and recommend ThredUP to everyone. Like “this $400 dollar blazer, got it for 6 dolla”. No complaints here",5
1839,"Seller: As a seller, the process is such a waste of time. It has taken almost two months for my clothing to be processed and put on the site. If an items is accepted you then have to approve the pricing and wait for it to be listed. If an item sells, you then wait for it to be shipped and accepted by the clients and then you finally get the couple of dollars you make from consignment. It will take upwards of 4 months to collect the $100 I’ll make from over 30 items of clothing I originally sent it. And that’s if everything sells! If it doesn’t sell you pay upwards of $15 to have it sent back to you. You’re better off with a local donation center.",1
1840,"I’m Obsessed!: I have used ThredUP for a couple years now and it’s my favorite way to shop used! I’ve had a couple items that were mismarked, but I either returned them with no hassles or gave them away if they weren’t returnable. My closet is quickly becoming predominately ThredUP purchases and I love it! It gives me the opportunity to reduce waste while also purchasing clothes from brands I normally couldn’t afford! The best of both worlds!",5
1841,"Love Thread Up: Purchased items for myself, then I purchased items for my mother. Very pleased with my purchases. I, love the fact that you can get a description of the item’s condition. It’s important to know the brands your buying because some brands run smaller than others. Also take in consideration that the previous owner may not of followed label care instructions. Haven’t had to return anything yet. Sure beats full price.",5
1842,"It’s not me, it’s you: I thought maybe I was imagining it. This app and service, which I once adored, has been less and less appealing. It first began when I recognized the poor value of the clean out bags. No matter. I won’t sell them anything. I still enjoyed purchasing my favorite designers at discounted prices. Recently, the pricing has been very poor. I saw a Reebok warm up for $30!?!  This is no deal. The outlet mall has it for like $18. What’s up Thred Up?  I strictly search for rare designers or high end items where I am familiar with the retail pricing. This is becoming less worth my time and definitely not worth my money.",2
1843,Pay outs have decreased significantly: The app itself is easy to use.  When I first started selling with thred up they were fair on prices they gave me for my clothing.  That has decreased over the past 18 months and the amount of money I get versus what they keep is not okay in my opinion.  I’m earning 40 cents for a pair of pants when I could sell that at a garage sale for more or donate them.  It’s just disappointing how little one bag earns now.,5
1844,"Good but not as good as the website: During deals where only certain items are a percentage off the app doesn’t display which items are discounted in the cart, just the number of savings. I would love a feature where I could see which of my favorites were discounted as well clearly on the screen during scrolling instead of clicking on each individual item",5
1845,"Love it!: I recently tried ThredUP for the first time and I definitely recommend it! Everything I ordered came exactly as it was pictured, and the prices are amazing for name brand clothing that is new or gently worn. I also ordered clean out bags and it was super convenient because they mail you the bag, you fill it up, and then you can leave it at your front door for USPS to pick it up! I will definitely be ordering from them in the future!",5
1846,"Best place to find hidden treasures!!!: I had a friend tell me about ThredUP, but I didn’t believe all her hype. There was no way she could be getting designer clothes for such amazing prices!!!! Boy was I surprised when I got on the site and saw for myself all the brands to choose from with the crazy affordable prices!!! I can’t stop checking back, multiple times a day, to see what new items they added! And I can shop for my kids on ThredUP too!",5
1847,"Cheating sellers out of commissions and losing designer jewelry: Thred up just jacked up their prices on designer handbags by more than half. I wonder if the sellers were compensated?  I have photos of the before (yesterday 12/1) and after (today 12/2). 

They also “lost” a Tiffany necklace and matching earrings in their blue bags that I sent in last month. Still no response from customer service after requesting the item back (which I paid the insurance for).",5
1848,"Prices creeping up; refunds slow, lots of retail rejects.: I have been a very good customer.  Over the past few weeks I’ve noticed their prices creeping up, that they are carrying a lot of unsold retail clothes (there was a reason they didn’t sell), they started imposing a “restocking fee”, their refunds are now very slow.  For awhile the refund was issued after being scanned at the post office.  I learned that packages bound for return are left at the post office until a secondary carrier collects them.  One package was left at my post office in New Orleans over a week.  Their descriptions and measurements are not reliable.  Customer service is rude and difficult to reach.   I was a fan until this summer.",1
1849,"DO NOT SELL HERE: ThredUP is good for buying clothes, I’ll say that, but if you’re looking for a place to sell old clothes LOOK ELSEWHERE. Total scam. I sent them several great condition items and out of the few they accepted I received .70 cents. First of all, that isn’t even enough to cash out. Second of all, they’re paying you PENNIES for what they’re selling your items for. All the items they accepted, they listed for well over 5.00 (plus their obligatory 5.99 shipping of course!). And what do they do with the items they don’t “accept”? Who knows. Unless you pay like 12 dollars to get them returned, you don’t know. Probably held onto and sold later on I’m sure. ThredUP is one hell of a scam.",1
1850,"Pretty good...: I like to buy secondhand. I also like to know what materials I’m wearing. Thredup is good overall, but fails to consistently provide enough information about the item materials or measurements for me to purchase with confidence. The downside to this is that you can only return for store credit if you don’t want to sacrifice shipping fees. Also, when returning (for store credit), the item must be sent to the warehouse within a few days or it will be cancelled and you’re stuck with the item. Overall the service is good, but lacking.",3
1851,"Good app, but it could use some updates: This is a good app for finding inexpensive clothes. It has decent searching capabilities to narrow down your search, but I really wish they improved those more. All it would take would be more detailed descriptions. For example-almost all of the dresses are categorized as “casual,” so there’s no way we can accurately search for a casual dress. This would narrow down the time it takes to find decent things, and it would make me purchase more",4
1852,"Obsessed with my new favorite site!!: I love the endless count of styles!!! I can personalize it just to show me my sizes and best of all, also photo search styles I’m interested in. Best 2nd hand store hands down !! With a quick click and search, IM OBSESSED!! All clothing is stored and taken well care of when they ship it over !! I can’t complain, Going no where else from now on !! Thank you Tred up !!",5
1853,"My favorite app!: Within the last 3 years I have lost 130 pounds. I had to re-purchase my entire wardrobe multiple. There is no way I would have been able to get quality items without ThredUP. I know what makers fit me, and I have confidence that ThredUP will back the quality they advertise or I get my money back. It has truly been the best money saver I have ever come across.",5
1854,5 Stars: Thred-up is a great option if you cannot go to thrift stores in person for whatever reason you may have. Also great for if you’re looking for something very specific but would like to buy it second hand. A reminder that buying second hand and from small businesses does not make over-consuming okay.,5
1855,"Scammers! Proceed with CAUTION.: I have been a longtime customer. Since they first launched their site I have regularly shopped there. I have referred many friends to thredUP. This past year I feel I have been SCAMMED. Every time I order, 2+ items are not as described regarding size. Shoes sold to me as a size 4 show up and they’re a size 9. With clear labeling on the shoes. Size 7 is a size 4. Again with the labeling on the items as clear as possible. Then many of these are “non returnable”. I believe they are intentionally mislabeling sizes in an attempt to move items faster. And place them as “non returnable” so you’re stuck with an item.",1
1856,"First order?!: I just got my first order!  I was honestly a tiny bit anxious.  I only spent 82 dollars and was hoping for the best!  Wow!!  Just wow!  I got three tops, two sweaters, and a pair of jeans and everything is super high quality and so so cute!!  I’m thrilled!  I immediately went on the site and ordered two jackets for less than 45 bucks!  I’m set for fall and winter pretty much!  I can’t imagine shopping anywhere else and I feel great knowing it’s all secondhand!!",4
1857,"Bug: filters no longer work in app: Filters no longer work on the mobile app, although they work as expected on desktop. When I use filters to search for trouser style pants, for example, every style of pant appears in the search results (and they are not mistakenly tagged as trousers, I’ve checked). My app and iOS version are up-to-date. I’ve had to resort to shopping on mobile web, or more often than not shopping elsewhere due to the inconvenience.",3
1858,"Aweful: Where do I even begin? Selling stuff here is a joke. I have sent in multiple nice pieces and have gotten pennys for them. So selling things is not worth anyone’s time. Also the pics need to be better. Several times I have ordered something and it has come completely different than described or showed. Especially black items, and the sizing is always off, if you’re going to pride yourself as a company that is sustainable and eco conscious you have to make a company that doesn’t make it impossible to return things either. I will not be using this app or buying from this company again.",1
1859,"Sizing is Problematic: I have enjoyed ThredUp in the past, and have found some nice items on the app. However, their sizing has become ludicrous with very little reliability. Plan to spend an extraordinary amount of time clicking on listings only to find that their posted sizes are no where near true to size fit. While you can filter the app to sort sizes, that will *not* yield refined results. Chest dimensions are often exactly the same between a 3x to an size 6. It’s an unpleasant chore to find any size continuity in their listings. For this reason, I no longer use the app.",2
1860,"Nice and cheap and slow transaction in cash out: I love some of the prices you have here but it’s like two months I haven’t gotten my cash out for the bundle of clothes I ship out like two big whole bags plus the prices you set here are way up too expensive and then the payout is very low but here you sell them here for so much smh, the only cheap ones are the fabic that is cheap",5
1861,"Great site, unfortch can’t use the app??: Love ThredUP, fully endorse going to the website and making some purchases!

However, I am annoyed because I created my account on the site with “sign up with Google.” The app doesn’t have this option ??? So there is no way for me to log into my account on the app. A bummer for me since whenever you go to the website on mobile it bugs you to use the app…which I can’t use…annoying.

Don’t create your account through Google I guess.",3
1862,"Poor customer service: Have shopped with ThredUP for the past 3 yrs and have been very pleased until recently.  I placed an order for 2 clean out bags in October, and on Oct 24 was told they shipped.  It is December 18 and I have never received them, have tried to alert the company.  They don’t seem to care as their customer service is non existent.  This issue doesn’t fall into a category their algorithm understands.
I will look for another company in the new year.",4
1863,"almost perfect: the only things i would like to see is that the other filters remain after changing one filter (size, color, etc). It is pretty frustrating to have to re-enter everything after modifying a filter. The pictures are also hard to make out— especially for dark colored items. Otherwise it’s great!",5
1864,"In the past I loved Thredup: My experience with my last order has been so terrible, I am not sure I will order from Thredup again, the processing was slow, the shipping very slow, I ordered on September 1, hoping to have a dress for a party on September 19, and on September 15, according to Fedex, the package is still in West Virginia.  It was supposed to be delivered to the post office today, which will then need another day or 2 to deliver.

Customer service is difficult to reach, and I not sure it is possible from the app, I’ve had some success from the website.  In the past I had loved their service, I am so disappointed.",1
1865,"The only way to buy clothes!: I have fallen in love with ThreadUp. I have gotten a number of new clothes for work and dresses for different occasions and have loved them all. I wish there was a filter for dresses with pockets and I wish there was a faster way to get the items I purchase, otherwise I love it and most of my clothes will be comping from ThreadUp. (Which means I’ll need to sell some there too.)",5
1866,"Poor customer service: I didn’t receive an item I purchased. No response on the issue. I’ve also received items that weren’t suitable for reselling - they looked great online but cheap in person. I really wanted this business to be where I purchased all of my clothes because it’s better for the environment. For now, I think I’ll shop elsewhere and save my money.",5
1867,"Photo quality could improve: I’ve been searching for sunglasses, and I’ve noticed that a lot of the photos are so overexposed that it’s hard to really tell what the sunglasses look like. I understand the challenges that come with photographing reflective surfaces, but the picture is so washed out. I couldn’t even see the side detail on a lot of them.

And it’s not just the sunglasses. I noticed the same washed out appearance on several of the photos in the accessories category. Please try to improve the way you photograph your items.",3
1868,"Lukewarm Feelings: Good concept but I confirm other reviews- I have gotten (multiple times) items that were labeled “as new (this item is in great condition; you may mistake it for brand new)” only to find stains, piling, and just an overall condition that left me wondering how those items got accepted in the first place given that ThredUP boasts itself as selective (“we only keep 40% of the items we receive”). Also, the prices on some items are almost as high as attempting to buy a new item in the store (meaning at sale price if one is available) whereas, as a seller, only a fraction is the pay-out.",2
1869,"Love this App!!: I first heard of ThreadUp as an app, but never really used it. I found it again online half a year later, totally forgetting that I had already seen it before. I’ve used it twice, and both times I bought 3 sweaters for less than $25. I now own 6 new sweaters that I bought for a total of around $48. This is honestly my favorite online place to shop now, and I almost never buy clothes in store anymore.",5
1870,"Hard to cash out: Tried multiple times to cash out what I was owed.  The app glitched after completing the form twice, then after going to complete the information for a third time I encountered an error message and couldn’t complete the form.  The small amount of money in my account is still sitting there.  In my opinion, it’s not worth the effort for the small payout you’ll get.  I’ll be contacting customer service and I’ll update this review once/if the problem gets solved.",4
1871,"Won’t contact me: They have this fun idea about buy and bundle where you can please orders within a wk and potentially make it to free shipping. Great idea. Never enough time to search the millions of items. Guess what wouldn’t work for me...buy and bundle. Let’s me place the first initial order and kept prompting me to order more but wouldn’t actually let me. I contact customer service(thumbs down). Automated response that they will get back to you in 2 hrs. They say couple. That means two. It’s been over 24 hrs, closer to 36, No response.  I have written them many times in an effort to get a response. Nothing. I won’t be making the time to bundle and lose that shipping money.",1
1872,"Quite reasonable: This is the second order I have placed.  I was only disappointed that there was a huge snag and a lot of discoloration on a shirt I received.   I understand this can happen with used clothing.  However, it should have been mentioned before I purchased it, and there should have been some place to answer if I was satisfied with the order.  None of those happened, so I was hesitant to shop again.  Hopefully this will be a better experience.",4
1873,"Great for Buying, Not Great for Selling: I have really enjoyed purchasing clothes from this company and almost everything I have ordered is in great condition. But if you’re wanting to make more than $5, don’t bother sending in a clean out bag. I have tried the clean out bag three times and gotten mixed results. They listed some of my never worn clothing as “showing significant signs of wear,” gave me no credit for my like-new Uggs claiming they don’t accept slippers, and didn’t accept a single item in my last bag which was filled with several brand new items. Enjoy shopping here, but it’s not worth the effort to sell.",2
1874,"TERRIBLE Customer Support: I sent a bag with a number of designer items. At the time I sent it in I was not given the option to get my items back. When they sent me my list with their prices, it seemed that my items were priced MUCH lower than similar products that I searched for, so I asked for my items back immediately. There was no response and they continued to sell my items after I sent repeated requests to customer support.  FINALLY I got the remaining items and now I have tried TWICE to get paid out using the cash out process. I have not been paid out. Oh, and another warning, the “account balance” they show is NOT what they pay out.",1
1875,No complaints: I really enjoy using this app to keep my wardrobe interesting. I feel like there are some really great steals to be had as well as some unique finds. I've never had any technical issues as far as the app crashing so are anything like that. Tracking my orders is very easy using the app and shipping is fairly quick. I have never tried selling to them but I have made returns and had no problems at all.,5
1876,"I love ThredUP!!: I’m a little addicted to this store. I have placed a couple orders now. They all arrived quicker than expected. I love the way they arrive, packed all cute. They have great prices. Everything I have ordered has fit exceptionally well. I’m very happy and can’t stop looking on there to see what jewels I can find. I really like the rewards as well. I definitely recommend checking them out.",5
1877,"Worth it!: I got three dresses at first… because my friend recommended the site… And I was so happy with the quality of the purchases… Super high-quality… That now I buy myself two or three things every month. I never spend more than $30 and I always end up with brand new things and I feel so good. I’m recycling, I’m getting a cheap rate, and I get fabulous new clothes.",5
1878,"Disappointed - Cleanout items missing: I had several items listed in my cleanout kit that are suddenly gone with no payout listed, however, I see them when I search for the items. The matching skirt to one of my tops is still in my cleanout page, however, no record of the top or its payout. There are several Reddit forums now stating the same things happening to them and the loss of trust in this company. It’s such a shame because I really enjoyed shopping sustainably like this.",3
1879,"Rip off: I’ve used ThreadUp for years as both a buyer and a seller and have always been a huge fan of the app. Recent changes have been extremely disappointing and I will no longer be using. An $18 processing fee? For what!? I will send in a bag and not get an update for months. When items are finally posted, over half of the bag isn’t listed, including brand new with tags designer items, and the payout is pennies. I am being charged to sell items on this app due to the new processing fee. 10+ items sold and the payout didn’t add up to $18 so now I am being charged. Terrible business model.",1
1880,Yes yes yes to ThreadUp: Ok so I was skeptical at first but i went ahead and ordered a bunch of clothes bc the prices weren’t bad and i really need work clothes. It didn’t take long for delivery at all and when i got the clothes i was shocked to find they were all in pretty much mint condition. I am so thrilled i found a second hand shop online that i can trust to give me decent quality clothing at a fair price.,5
1881,"Great Shopping: I found the store on eBay and decided to go directly to the website I am super excited to find some great finds and really fair prices. I got a coupon and free shipping. OMG!

1882,"“Up for ThredUp”: Thred Up is my favorite online store to shop for apparel  There’s so much to choose from what your desiring rather than going in-store shopping and  finding out they don’t have your size.  

With ThredUp Online you can customize your size so most every fits. Although, the best part is all the perks they offer and discounts, rewards. 
Even more when you have the App.
  
The prices and quality of items are always picked right from there superior inspection then packaged with care.  

ThredUP got it right! They make it easy for consumers to earn a little cash by cleaning out there closets 
with a online bag they offer

Just fill and ship! No fees, from your 
wallet. 

TredUp is up Is up in my book!

1883,"Guilt Free Addiction: I love browsing thredUP. New items are constantly being added. 
At first, it’s a little difficult to find what you like. I was browsing hundreds of items that I didn’t like. It wasn’t until I favorited and purchased items that I began to see more of what I like.
I wish it was easier to search items. The searches are kind of general, but with time I’ve gotten better at searching what I actually want.",4
1884,"Love thredup, but some suggestions for fixes: I love thredup. Customer service is amazing! I now shop no where else. However,  the App needs some fixes, hyperlinks to some brands still aren’t working, which is “1st world problem” frustrating as you then must do a manual search. It also would be great to eliminate certain fabrics from a search, like synthetic fabrics. I.E. “does not include”… “polyester”",5
1885,"Love this!!!: I occasionally “need” an item of clothing, but a lot of the time I just “want” something different. What could be better than purchasing gently used clothing that costs significantly less than if I bought it new and does not require the use of more natural resources in order to manufacture it? I’d frequent local thrift stores but honestly, this is so much easier! Love, love, love this!",5
1886,"Highly Recommend!!: Thredup is awesome! Both their mobile version and website work well and the amount of money I save is crazy! I can’t stop using thredup!

1887,"Inconsistency in search: I struggle trying to search and filter things in this app. I search velvet and then either a company with velvet in their title will appear or random items that have little to do with velvet will appear.
I try and filter the fabric but it only shows common fabrics like cotton or polyester. Sometimes, I want specific fabrics like tencel, organic cotton, or viscose and I can’t filter it to get that but yet it’ll be listed in the description.
 I would give a lot to just search flannel and see flannel. Search velvet and see velvet. And search sweater dress and see sweater dresses.",2
1888,Quality of clothes: I normally only order like new or new with tags but each item I have had received has been exactly as represented. I have found more petite sizes here than any store without the hassle. I recommend Thread up to all my friends and am happy to show off my new outfits when I get them. Packaging and shipping is great. So glad I found this site!,5
1889,Waste of effort: I used this app way before COVID happened and feel in love with it if I order there clean out kit I would get in 2 weeks and same with ordering there clothes but after Covid happened they really turned on me especially way after quarantine I ordered the clean out kit 3 months after the masks have been lifted and I yet still haven’t gotten my clean out kit and it’s still telling in process I have even ordered clothes after that and didn’t arrive till a month I wish this covid didn’t happen bc I would be getting my box or clothes and my clean out kit in 2 weeks not in months,1

Hope you enjoy the app.",5
1891,"Inseams for women: I noticed that in filling out sizes, they don’t ask for inseam.  I know most manufacturers give no such information.  Why this is, someone please educate me.  I need 34” or 35” inseam.  Why does every 
manufacturer think all women are short, average or “tall”.  Tall is 33” generally.  Always high waters.  
I have also observed, most of the clothes look fairly well worn.  Several had holes, snags, stains.  The quality control isn’t great.  But they think wel of themselves, a sweater I LOVED for $30 was snagged in quite an obvious place.  
I’m sure there must be decent stuff, my experience hasn’t been great.",2
1892,Addicted: Love the variety of clothing and shoes.    Filters could use better descriptors for a more selective sort: to include “not wanted” feature.    Photos of bags and totes could use an inside picture.    Fabric descriptions should be mandatory on all items being sold or at least a close up photo of material.    I live in Florida and have had to send back several items because the fabric was too heavy for my location.  Thank you,4
1893,"Seriously love this company and app: I’ve shopped on ThredUP for about 3 years and it’s been so great that I never buy new anymore. Yes, it’s a gamble when you can’t see the clothes in person or try them on, but I love that they list actual measurements of clothing as a reference. Once I find a brand I love I stick to it. The rewards are pretty nice perk too. Overall super happy with my experience with this company.",5
1894,"Amazing!: ThredUP has not disappointed me so far, Ive gotten great items and even though it takes time to find things of your interest, it is worth it, just like shopping at an in-person thrift shop where you got to seek to find good pieces. Searching specific things is a bit of a hassle but you get the hang of it with time and find other cool garments in the process!",5
1895,"The Best!: I’ve shopped for nearly all my needs on ThredUp since 2017. The best feature is being able to filter by material: as I prefer natural fibers, I’m able to select cotton, wool or silk and see the best available options. This saves so much time and effort. Occasionally I have seen the materials listed incorrectly: I’m sure it’s not easy to get it right but ThredUp’s return policy is great. Unfortunately, I’ve never had success buying shoes from ThredUp.",5
1896,"Love: I have made 2 orders so far and I love everything that I’ve gotten! I can get items from really great brands at honestly astonishing prices (like a Uniqlo skirt for $0.99!!! I know right?!). The app is easy to use and you can filter items to your sizes or anything you could want (colors, price, etc.) making it so simple and convenient. The items I get are exactly as described and I’ve recommended ThredUP to literally all of my friends!",5
1897,"Addictive: I love shopping at ThredUP, I’ve been a regular customer, and probably will continue to be.  I did just have a very bad experience with some pants I ordered, they smelled so bad I nearly gagged.  I’ve never had this happen before and I did let ThredUP know, and I’m in the process of sending them back!  Selling is not my favorite to do because I don’t feel I get much for the really nice items I’ve sent them.  However in thecompany’s defense they do send the bags to you and no shipping charge.",4
1898,"Well planned app: Good user interface and I love all the different ways to filter and pare down searches. Customer service is amazing. That really makes the difference in me using this app. Good response time and communication within the company seems fluid.

My issues that I have would be the app lagging when I use a lot of filters, and I have noticed that not all items are categorized appropriately. For instance, I have seen knee length dresses that are not categorized as such, so I would miss seeing that item if I used knee length filter. 

I also got a sweatshirt that was supposedly women’s large, but it wouldn’t even go over my shoulders. Seemed to be large child’s.

They have pretty good sizing in general but sometimes I think the people measuring are using cm and not inches or they double the inch amount they measure as across.",4
1899,"Thrift Ease: I love this site!! There are a lot of deals to be had here! I’ve sold items, purchased items, and recommended it to many people. The app is easy, the buy and bundle is cool to use, and it’s fun to find unique items. I do wish it would recommend items based on favorites as it sometime feels like you have to wade through a lot of stuff to fine one item you like. Everything looks wrinkled, but considering how much they have to process it makes sense.",4
1900,"Amazing!: I made my first purchase. They came quickly and I was amazed at the quality. 3 items were a bit big. Processing a return was easy and fast. I have since then made a second order. I’ve requested 2 bags to send in. 1 is currently being processed. I’m so in love with this place, it’s my new place to shop for clothes for my new job and my kids. The app is very easy to work and maneuver. Completely recommending!!!",5
1901,"Don’t sell with this app: Started using thredUP and initially had a great experience.  It was a great way to sell clothes and make a little money off of clothes that I would have just donated.  You only get a small percentage of what you sell.  For example if they sell something for $20 you would get $2.  The last few bags I sent were never processed and when I check the status they say arrived for processing.  They have been sitting there for over 3 months.  No response from the site on why.  I also can’t order any more clean out bags.  If you are looking to make $ off your items - you are better off with eBay, consignment shop ect",1
1902,"Once was great now sucketh! 👎🏻: Loved this company at one time. Now they take forever to reply to you, can’t communicate with them at all except virtually, sends out items with not all pieces attached, did not send me a item out at all yet never contacted me, changed the return policy for the worst and then takes FOREVER to even get your credit back. I’m just trying to get and use my credit up and not use this company again. Do yourself a favor and go use Poshmark. At least the have good standards, good prices, and great shipping and return policies.",3
1903,"Summer Hobby: Addicted. This app has restocked my closet with new fun. Measurements are key as we all know sizes in women's clothes are a farce so watch them closely. I've had some hits and misses but love shopping in a consignment shop with a broader resource pool. Returns are easy, but patience is required for return credit. Love this greener way to shop. Filters are super helpful to prevent scrolling through items outside your ranges. Room to improve? Always. But love my overall experience.",5
1904,Fun to shop!: I’ve been using thred up for a few months and have bought some really great clothes. But I’ve noticed lately that they’re prices are getting higher and higher. 48 bucks for a pair of used jeans is a bit much for an online thrift store. If I wanted to pay that I’d go straight to Macy’s first. Other than that I’ve never had any issues with customer service or returns. Just the crazy prices lately,5
1905,"Customer Service: I have made every effort to contact customer service due to an order that has never arrived. No one ever gets back to me.   All I want is my money back if I am not going to receive the items. This is a terrible way to do business!

They send me emails to contact them about an order that I never received but there’s no way to return the email and they will not answer the so called chat.",5
1906,"Changing my opinion....: I have both shopped and sold at this site. You can get some great deals on merchandise, but keep that in mind if you want to sell stuff. They are a business, so you get lot an average of 15-20% for your items. 

Pros: Everything I've purchased comes in a nice box, neatly wrapped. Very professional. No hassle returns.

Cons: They have gotten to pricey. I have both a Marshalls and TJ Maxx near me. I can get better deals there on new stuff.",5
1907,"Stolen from my cart: I am new to this app and have been looking trough and and having fun this past week or so picking through and finding some great items and filling my cart. I found this AMAZING dress I was the most excited about buying and to my surprise, it disappeared from my cart BEFORE my time was up. If they have an inside person picking and choosing items they want, that’s lousy. If they return my item, I will buy all my things and give them 5 star, if not, I will never buy from them and tell my friends the same. 

And I did send an email with the item number and a picture before costumer supports comes on with their generic response.",1
1908,"Amazing Purse Selection at Great Prices: I first went on this site to browse for nice leather purses and look at my favorite brands: Brighton, Brahmin, Kate Spade and Coach. I was so impressed by the prices that I decided to order a Brighton crossbody and wallet. WOW, they look new and I have received so many compliments on these. I had to share my secret! Continue to buy quality purses here and probably will not pay full price again.",5
1909,Rip off: Thredup is okay to make purchases. Trendy way to advertise a goodwill/salvation army type store in a modern way. However the pay is  very minimal. I understand that it is stated up front that payout is less than a consignment shop but it seems they are ripping people off completely. I sent in a bag with new items tags still attached and pricey items brought from Macy’s and brand new guess heels. My payout was about 5 dollars. Definitely a rip off. Sellers beware. And FYI I had to rate this post at least a three to submit it. All the rest of the times it read error. Just something to think about ......,2
1910,"Great way to shop but shipping is TOO SLOW!: Update: I used to love ThreadUp. But I think they are getting greedy with profits when they switched to slower shipping. Now it takes up to 15 days to deliver?!  I’m in Seattle too, not a remote area.  #threadup call your UPS or FEDEX rep and get Express shipping.  

Save money, your time and the environment!  I have a toddler so I have little to no time to shop. When I do I hate spending tons of money on things I may wear once.  This is app is a life changer!
Drawbacks are the product photos could be better. Dim lighting does not allow for good viewing of the clothes and shoes.  Wish I could sort out what I don't want instead of just what I want.
Need to fix referral link. I've referred this to several people who bought, but I did not get the credit they promised.  I had to go request it.  
Last, returns could be better.  The last two times I have had to remind them to send me a return label.",2
1911,"App needs to change it's hold option and prices.: My review is mainly geared towards buying, not selling. I really like finding items on the app. However, the hold process needs to be updated. People are allowed to place an item in a cart that is held there for 24 hours. This is far too long. I have been interested in several items on the app and am unable to buy because they are constantly on hold. Pretty disappointing. I do also feel the prices are higher than what you could find elsewhere.",3
1912,"Frequent Function Problems: I love ThredUp but get frustrated with the glitches. Most recently there have been issues with the returned search results not filtering accurately (e.g., item Materials or Condition) and long-standing Saved Searches getting changed (i.e., results cast a way wider net than the set search criteria). I end up having to delete and recreate my Saved Searches. It would be great if the ThredUp programmers could make sure these functions work properly before they push updates.",3
1913,"Goodbye paycheck!!!!: I have a raging addiction to discounted brands - I get a high from shopping for deals that I can’t explain and refuse to apologize for. I have only bought one item so far but I already know that this is going to be my new late night guilty pleasure! I got a Halston purse for $33, people — and it is GORGEOUS!!!!!!!! 
Don’t think about it, just GO! No one ever said on their death bed “I’m glad I saved all this money!”",5
1914,Slow clean out process: I love the purchasing aspect of this app but I mailed a clean out bag to Thred Up in July. They received it a month later and it is now October and it has still not been processed. If it takes them that long to process clothing then I would say they don’t actually need my clothes. I will take them to my local consignment store Clothes Mentor that pays cash up front.,5
1915,Not good: So regular shopping isn’t bad but descriptions don’t always match. Shipping will be expensive. Returns may as well keep the item cause there will be nothing left of the refund by the time you pay all the shipping and refund charges. Clean outs are a waste of time. Charge so much for shipping and only give you around 5% of what item sells for so by the time they take the almost $30 in shipping you get nothing. They will not communicate any of this to you until after the fact then it will take months before you get anything telling what they kept and how much.,1
1916,"Great prices. Poor descriptions: I have been shopping on thredUP for over five years. I also have sold a number of items and I appreciate the simple process.

My current disappointment is the item descriptions. On my most recent order, one tunic top was labeled as a dress.
One pair of pants had an inseam 4 inches shorter than what was listed. The inseam being shorter was significant, because I am a  tall woman. The inseam stated as 34.5” seemed to indicate that this was a pair of pants for talls ( brand specializes in talls).

Measurments for tops and dresses frequently same off. I know what size I wear for many companies. And the bust and waist measurements often seem so wrong, that I don’t order. 

all that to say prices are better than some other apps, and I still prefer thredup.  I just end up, donating or giving away half of what I order from thredUP.",3
1917,"Delivery: This week was my last order from ThreadUp. I have generally enjoyed buying consignment however the delivery process is outrageous here in Alpharetta,Ga. I think they use independent individuals who could care less about your things. The latest delivery was thrown on my front lawn and found it this morning. Sorry I’m done until they find a more responsible way to deliver.",5
1918,Not a Fan: Some people have this app to shop and maybe it’s good for that but I downloaded it to sell and sent in 2 full bags of clothes that where expensive nice clothing items and that was around 2 months ago and I have checked the app multiple times not seeing any updates besides both bags had arrived at the facility I checked it today and saw that I had received 50 points that where about to expire and $10 dollars off so now I just feel ripped off. I’m thinking that there not giving all those clothes to charity there most likely selling yours and mine don’t get ripped off!!,1
1919,"My favorite place to find the most for my $: I absolutely LOVE this site!  I can spend less than $100 at a time and get 6-8 outfits!  And not just outfits… CUTE outfits!!  I’m spending less and getting more!  Not to mention they have such a variety of great things, something for everyone!  They even have designer, runway clothes and bags and shoes and and and and… the list goes on!",5
1920,"Great company!: I’ve bought and sold to ThredUP for a couple of years and I really enjoy it. A feature I appreciate is that they give bust and length measurements for tops and waist and length measurements for pants/shorts. This is so helpful because of the variations in various manufacturer’s sizing. Also, returns are incredibly easy. I also like that they have high standards for accepting clothing and I’ve always felt that I got a good deal.",5
1921,"Really good overall!!: This is my main place to shop at this point (in addition to a local thrift store). I love most of the features, love being able to sort, love the rewards & sales, and love the sustainability! Couple things that would help me… I’d love it if they’d add the waist size to the skirt measurements. I’d also love if they’d include the calf measurement for boots—may be a weird request but I have larger calves. Last thing is I wish they’d add a filter for dresses for sleeve length!",4
1922,"This app is great!!: I love this app, it’s a great online thrift shop and i’m very surprised on how much clothes they have!! However after going on the app for the first time it took so long to get in, i’ve waited around 15 minutes for it to load and it didn’t :(. So I had to basically download and delete then repeat, just so the app wouldn’t load and instead open. That’s the only thing that bugged me, anyways this is a great app tho. :)) !",4
1923,"My Addiction: At first, ThredUp seemed frustrating, but once I got used to the quirks and patterns, shopping became a hunt! There’s just as much product as a physical thrift store would have, but there’s always something to look at. Lately my favorite things to hunt for are tapered dress pants and flattering dresses. Any time I need something or see a new trend or inspiration, I have to check ThredUp first! The products are so unique and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",5
1924,"So much fun!: Thred Up is so addictive, shopping will never be the same for me. I love how easy I can filter and sort what I’m looking for. I love saving my favorites as I see them, then they’re ready to add to my cart when I’m ready to buy.  My items come just as they appear and when something doesn’t work, returns are easy. They quickly credit my account so I can try something else. Try Thred Up, you will love it!",5
1925,"Consistently wrong descriptions: I have ordered from ThredUP 6 times... and 5 out of those 6 times, the description of the item has been wrong. I’m left incredibly unhappy. I’ve returned two of the items, but at this point, with having to pay a restocking fee every time, I’m just losing and wasting money. I really like shopping ThredUP because I love second hand clothing. I’m just so disappointed to be so excited for a pair of boot leg/flare jeans... then open the package and they’re SKINNY jeans. There’s no mistaking that. 5 out of 6 times :( I will waste no more money on ThredUP. I’ll just stick with Poshmark or Goodwill.",2
1926,SAVED SO MUCH!!!!: This app is literally amazing. I have been talking to my friends for years saying how there really should be an online thrift store that isn’t as expensive as some of the higher end ones are and especially right now in the pandemic this a lifesaver when it comes to thrifting. I have saved SO MUCH because of thredup and I’ve some amazing things! For instance I got an $80 coat for 10 bucks. Recommend highly!!!,5
1927,"Budget saver: I have 4 children and began shopping with ThredUP a few years ago. It has definitely helped me stay within budget with good quality clothing. I get everything from shoes to school uniform options, church clothing and everyday options. When I do my closet clean outs, I send back what I can to start the cycle over again. I am
a big fan! My only suggestion would be to offer men’s clothing options.",5
1928,"Nearly perfect: There’s so many wonderful things about the functionality of this app that make shopping on ThredUP more enjoyable. The search and filter features are second to none. There’s also a wealth of account information readily available. My only issue is that the app freezes sometimes when I open it and I have to delete and reinstall. It’s worth it, though, because I’m always keeping my favorites list updated.",4
1929,"Love it!: I absolutely love this app! You have to be careful in sizes because all brands have their own idea of what small, Ned, large means, but that is pretty easy to do. I only order when there are actual measurements listed or if I know the brand well. The cloths are very nice and the prices are amazing. They make it easy to return with just a small restocking fee. It’s the main place I shop now.",5
1930,"Had my doubts but incredibly impressed: Not being able to physically see second hand clothes felt like a hell of a risk. However the clarity of the pics and the ability to zoom in to the wrinkles etc has made me a loyal customer to Thred Up.
I have yet to do a Clean Out kit ... they don’t service Hawai’i unfortunately but as a shopper, i have made numerous purchases and the ease of the app and website make it worth while.",5
1931,"Not a fan: The site was recommended to me from a co worker. I thought it was cute, I purchased a romper 2/3 sizes bigger then needed to be. However the romper cane didn’t fit, I tried to reach customer service no phone number it’s a online chat. The chat discussion took several days and several attempts to get completed answers. I ended up sending the romper back in the nick of time. I did pay for the return shipping & a additional fee to restock the item. This was my one & only purchase. Will not be returning. I urge customers to think long and hard before spending your money here. Shop local!",2
1932,Impressive: I was skeptical about ordering at first even with the product labeled as new with tags still on it. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I have had bad experiences with online sales from eBay in the past. The dress arrived a lot faster than I expected it to. It came just in time for my birthday so I can wear it on that day. The dress is in perfect condition and I love the pattern. I highly recommend trying ThredUP if you haven’t already :),5
1933,"Disappointed: Just a comment or two...I have become disillusioned and disappointed in Thread Up recently. The new return policy (I used to take my returns to the post office and the money would be back in my account before I got back home), the restocking fee keeps increasing, the tax charged , the amount of time to determine the payout for a clean out bag (4 months!) and the free return policy, gone. The reasons why I loved Tread Up are now gone. Sad.",5
1934,Amazing way to shop!: This truly has been a shopping game changer for me. The choices are endless and the app is so easy! Love that the app will only show you items in the sizes you set up in filters so you aren’t forced to sift through items that aren’t your size. Have loved most of the items I’ve ordered; but those that I haven’t loved were easily returned for credit. Will continue to shop lots ❤️❤️,5
1935,Love this online thrift store: I honestly recommend shopping here. I’m a big believer in reducing my carbon footprint by buying second hand clothes and I just love how this store shares the same value as me. Everything I have boughten from thredUP has not disappointed me. On top of everything this store offers coupons all the time which makes the clothes even cheaper!!!,5
1936,"I LOVE thredUP: thredUP is amazing!! I am pregnant with my second baby and I have bought zero clothes for her from the stores. I have been able to find great clothes through this app at amazing prices. I have also sent them some of my old clothes and I enjoy having the credits given to me to use on future purchases. The payout for the clothes is not super great, and I’m sure I could get more money elsewhere, but the convenience makes it more enticing for me to send them clothes.",4
1937,Love buying.. I will never try to sell with them again though: I love everything I've bought off thredUP... it arrives timely and in great shape! I am however disappointed with the selling process... i sent a whole bag of great clothes And most all of them have sold and I've only gotten $2.95.... I also have shared and had friends sign up through my link and it says I should get $10 and I've never gotten it. I've also message thredUP multiple times about it and no one has responded to me. I will keep buying because the items and quality are great but I'm really annoyed with the company,2
1938,"Unhappy: I have been a customer of yours for several years. I have recommended you to a lot of friends and colleagues. Unfortunately, I have had issues and trying to get in with customer service has always been a struggle. In trying to place an order today I lost an item. I would really like to continue to order from you and recommend you, but I have become very frustrated several times trying to process orders. Kind Regards, Toni Walser",3
1939,Loyal Customer No More: The app is ok. Not fully functional. Allegedly there are things you’d need the website for even though who the heck uses a website these days?! And the company has crummy customer service to boot. Very inconsistent messaging. ThredUP  has spending tiers for different reward statuses. Pay close attention to your spending. They will not round. No matter the narrow margin by which you may miss the next tier. Timers on carts are awful too. Somehow notifications don’t work consistently. There’s a lot of room for improvement here despite years of my dedication. Time to find a new consignment shop. Sad.,1
1940,"Best & Favorite Way to Shop: Since a friend helped me “discover” ThredUp, I’ve found so many wonderful items and saved so much money on items for my children and for me.

I find they are quite accurate with their ratings as to product quality and generous with prices and sales. 

The app is easy to use, which is always a plus to me.

The customer service has been responsive and extraordinary. A friend and I accidentally switched labels and I was getting credit for $300 designer sales/ payouts; she got about .77 for my Children’s Place belt…) This was resolved efficiently in a matter of a few hours.

I also love the commitment to sustainability. 

I love my ThredUP purchases AND feel good about them!",5
1941,Support: Don’t try to speak to anyone real from this company. You will get put into a chat that doesn’t answer your questions and then if you call be told that you must have a disability to get a call back. I have spent thousands of dollars over the past 5 months to be treated so rudely. I love their clothes but their lack of customer care is a turn off.,5
1942,Creating Perceived Value: In my line of work it is hard to deny but the truth is the higher the quality of your clothing and how they look and fit on you is key for people valuing you and the services that you provide. I have been able to buy excellent quality clothes that look sensational on me at a reasonable price oh well doing good in this world. Thank you!,5
1943,"Not Worth the Trouble: I did a massive closet clean-out prior to moving, and I ordered several clean-out kits. In early June, I shipped 6 bags that were all received by ThredUp by mid-July. It’s the end of August, and they have processed 2 of tge 6 bags. The other 4 bags of clothes, shoes, and purses are just sitting there. 

The whole point of ThredUp is that they do yge processing and mailing. But I spent a fair amount of time processing to get things ready to ship, weighed, and labeled and they are not doing anything. Meanwhile I could have sold all of this stuff for more money on Poshmark without much more effort. 

Soooo not worth it.",2
1944,"Biggest & best online thrift!: I’ve been shopping thredup since 2016. As a lifelong thrifter, I adore the huge selection & numerous filter options. Customer service experiences have been great, too. On average, about 1/10 of my items arrive with more wear or damage than noted in the description. These are easily returned or refunded. My only suggestion is to hire more ppl to speed up processing time. So much love!",5
1945,"Great but things are changing: I have been obsessed with ThredUP for a few years now and most of my wardrobe at this point comes from ThredUP. But things have been changing. The restock fee went from $1.99 per item up to $3.99. I’ve had some issues getting my refund on my latest return, which has never been a problem before. I think I’m going to take a break from it for a little while.",4
1946,"Love this app!: I’m not one for consignment stores, or any other second hand store- I just don’t feel like I have the time to look through things.

ThredUP is so organized and easy to use! Putting your measurements in really helps to stream line what you’re looking for.

Returns are also very easy, if something wasn’t up to par, or didn’t fit they’ll take it back. Quality issues have been few and far between but always taken back if it wasn’t what it said it was.

I wish more people used this app. Stopping the line of fast fashion is essential, and you’ll most likely find what you’re looking for here. Be it a new (to you) coach clutch, to an everyday tank top that you love.",5
1947,"Addictive: I used to scroll FB and Insta… now I scroll my saved searches on ThredUP!!  There is an art to getting the best deals but once you figure it out you’ll have the best and most extensive wardrobe for so much less!  Sometimes the app is a little glitchy and we could use a few more filter choices, but mostly it works seamlessly with the website. I only wish they had more clothes for men. My husband feels cheated!",4
1948,"Theft of Luxury Items and the worst customer service: I used to love this company. They’ve completely changed. It took almost a year to process my bags. Then they stole a Marc Jacobs bag, a Sam Edelman bag, and a handful of other quality leather goods in amazing condition. They kept a cheap American eagle bag. This is straight theft. I’m certain they kept and sold my items so as not to pay me. They also have some of the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. And so many hidden fees they’ve tacked on at this point. Absolutely do not use them. They’ll charge you $6 to get each of your items back if you choose to reclaim.",1
1949,"Love ThredUP, not excited about recent changes: I’ve been buying almost all my clothes from them for a couple years. I really enjoy using the app and they have great stuff. Not too happy about new changes with their Buy and Bundle prices and it seems like more stuff is now on a final sale and you can’t return them if they don’t fit. But overall, I will still be using this as my go to for clothes.",4
1950,"Be careful shopping on this site: Everything we ordered, at least in jeans were NOT as described.  All the shirts and hoodies were fine, but the jeans, OMG, every pair was different than advertised.  Nothing that arrived was what it says it was.  And whatever you do do NOT send your own clothes out to be sold, you will never get what your asking, they sell your belonging for way less than you were told, and may not even get paid at all.  All you get when trying to contact any customer service is generic emails back saying sorry we’re working on it.  Shop and sell st your own risk.  Good luck.",1
1951,"Professional & Trusted: Love, love, love the endless brand options available to shop from! I enjoy the look of the app — feels professional and like you’re shopping from a single clothing brand itself. I also appreciate the paper wrapping of the clothes that is sealed with a cute sticker. I feel like I’m shopping from a company that really cares about the customer experience.",5
1952,"Always pleasantly surprised by ThredUP!: This is by far the best online shopping site if you’re looking for infinitely fashionable basics that are eco-friendly and inevitably adorable! I would recommend this thrift shop to whomever is looking to spice-up their personal style without leaving an echoing hole in their wallet. It’s affordable, which makes you FEEL and LOOK good! Give it a try. I guarantee you won’t regret it.",5
1953,Cball: The app is great but the service not so much. It’s great to find good deals on expensive clothing but not to open a package that literally stinks from body odor and you can see the perspiration marks on the clothes!  I bought 2 expensive jackets which were marked down considerably.  The reason they appeared to be so worn is because they were filthy!  It’s only common sense and and common courtesy to wash or dry clean clothing before you try to sell it someone else!,4
1954,Used to love this company: I have purchased a lot and sold a lot with them. Lately their communication has fallen off from what would be expected when you ship them hundred of dollars in clothing for them to sell and they do nothing with it for months with no communication. I could have sold the clothes on another platform which values their customers.,5
1955,Great thrift site: I thrift with them regularly and more than half of the items I send result in them placing them on the site.   This makes me happy since my items are getting a second chance.   Items that I have bought I have been very satisfied and would buy again.   No issues with selling or buying from this site,5
1956,"Pretty good: Enjoy shopping for deals, some good ones. There are also designer items priced way above what they should be. You get almost nothing for selling with them, but if you are going to get rid of anyway, at least its something? They forgot to process one bag completely & shorted me some $ they said they were going to put in. A bit frustrating, but kinda fun to shop for deals anyway! Frustrating but fun..",4
1957,"TOTAL SCAM: DO NOT SELL YOUR CLOTHES HERE. I sent in over $200 worth of like new, and new with tags clothing to ThredUp and never received a payment. I saw my items listed on the website and saw some had sold, but no money was put in my ThredUp account. The items they decided not to list were never sent back to me, even though I paid extra to ensure they would be. So disappointed. I WANT MY MONEY AND CLOTHES BACK, not a link to open a dispute. Absolute scam artists claiming to be helping the fashion industry with sustainability. Will be filing suit soon as it has been over a year since i first left a review and contacted the company 3 times, with no response or reconciliation. FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD",1
1958,"The WAITING continues...: It’s been 5 months since I sent my clothes in, what are you people doing at thread up??? Hire some more folks! This is absolutely ridiculous & forget reaching out to customer service that’s a waste of time. They basically just tell you they are overwhelmed & can’t get the job done!! 
At least try to make your sellers happy in some way!!! 
This use to be such a great thing years ago, I don’t know if it changed hands or what happened??
No matter who I’ve talked too (which it’s hard to reach someone) the wait time for processing clean out bags is ridiculously to long I mean I’m at 5 months now!!!!! Where is my stuff thread up????",1
1959,"rip off: i ordered a clean out bag to send in clothing, i filled it with about thirty pieces including designer jeans. after about a month it was processed and i was told my estimated pay out was $5 when i sent hundred of dollars of new clothing and they only accepted five pieces and donated the rest to charity even though the site told me i would receive my unacceptable items back. i also found out that $10 will be taken from my $5 payout. so in all they stole hundreds of dollars in clothes from me and i get NOTHING!! when i ordered my clean out bag i was informed that the bag and handeling would be FREE but now they think i owe them!!! i would give 0 stars if possible",1
1960,"Disappointing: Sizes are not as advertised and differ even within their own descriptions. 
Their shipping is inconsistent. Was supposed to get an order on one Saturday went to track it and suddenly it was and entire week later. I needed it before then and was going to be out of town. 

You can occasionally get something good here, but on the whole, it’s disappointing.",5
1961,Love it!: I ordered several items from ThredUP and could not wait for the clothes to arrive. The items were shipped from two different warehouses...my first box had four items and all were in great shape. I did have to return several pieces because they did not fit just right but I was impressed. My second box arrived today and all three of the items fit perfectly! I am hooked on ThredUp..,5
1962,"Thieves in an app: Biggest thieves in history! I sent over $350 of clothes with tags on them and ended up getting less than $15. They sell $80 item for $9.99 and you only make 25c-30c PER item. YES you read correctly.. whatever you send them you will earn .25 cents for it!! On top of that they hit you with transfer fees to transfer the measly money into your account. Better off donating the stuff to goodwill for people who really need it, and that’s what I did to my remaining stuff!! 
For sellers it’s a NO, for buyers it might be another story, but then again check your local Goodwill for gems like mine! You’ll def find them there!! Never ever again!!!",1
1963,Grossly overrated items: I believe this is a great concept however there is either lack in oversight or gross overrating of quality. I ordered a blouse that looked great online but arrived in terrible condition. It needed to be thrown in the garbage not sold. There was significant wear to the item and it was covered in human hair! I contacted thredUP and much to my dismay have not heard a word in weeks. Lack of customer service and lack of quality will keep me from ordering again.,5
1964,"Great Clothing App: I would highly recommend this app to anyone who is trying to save some money on clothes. I think it is better than the other apps that I have tried. Although it doesn’t have fast shipping, it is worth it. You have to pay shipping for like $5.99 but over $80 dollars would be free. That is my only concern but other than that, it is amazing. Been using it for over a year.",5
1965,"Great prices and lots of variety!: The quality of the used clothes is pretty good and they send you a variety of items that are all pretty affordable. Some of the pieces I didn’t think I would like I ended up loving! I’m not too keen on online shopping because I like to try things on before committing to buying but they have great return options. If you like to save money and help the planet, give this app a try!",5
1966,"Great app + keeps getting better: I love the app shopping experience & it keeps getting better. Way to go, ThredUP - three cheers for starting strong and continuing to evolve. As for thredUP in general I love shopping used and contributing to recirculating fashion rather than directly or indirectly piling more up in landfills. This is an especially fun way to do it because the selection is vast and higher quality than you could otherwise find.",5
1967,Goody boxes are a win!: I HATE shopping in store... I usually end up buying too much tho doesn’t fit or passing up cute outfits because they are too pricey. ThredUp is perfect! Especially their goody boxes. I enjoy not having to commit to the clothes in my box and having a stylist pack it for me! Takes all the pressure off. PLUS! I’m giving clothes a second chance and that makes me feel good :) highly recommend ordering a goody box!,5
1968,Perfect for me!: I love this service! I have taken advantage of their bundle and buy option also. Some people complain that they pay more than a thrift store but I don’t find that to be the case. I don’t find any thrift stores with the designer brands offered here and the ability to find nearly new stuff instantly. Quality is great and the care put into the packages is amazing. Already recommending ThredUP to everyone. :),5
1969,"ThredUP = ❤️: Shopping never became so much fun and convenient. 97% of all my clothing/accessories happens on thredUP. 
It’s hard to pinpoint why I love this site so much because there are so many great things about it! You’ve got the selection of clothing that is basically one of kind, the great prices,the fun packages that arrive on your door step and even the thrill of chasing items into your cart....then keeping them there. 
All and all I’m happy ThredUP was created!",5
1970,"Totally not worth for selling reasons!: This app has lots of cheap and affordable options as far as buying goes, but I do NOT recommend using it to sell your items. You would be way better off taking your items to a Plato’s Closet! The payout is HORRIBLE. I sent in a brand new, never worn Tommy Hilfiger coat that was purchased for $120, and was given $22 for it. You also do not get the money unless someone buys it. You can request to get the money before it is sold, but it’s even lower than what they offered. (Ex: if I chose to get the money for my coat before it is sold, I would only get $15 instead of $22). 

Totally not worth it. 
Take your clothes to a Plato’s Closet, people.",1
1971,"Clunky App and Bad Customer Service: I had used this app previously at an old address. When I realized the mistake I tried contacting their customer service immediately to correct it. They claimed, even though all activities were still pending, that they had no way of updating my shipping address or being able to cancel an order so I could resubmit it. What kind of business does that?! They said call Fedex, which I promptly did and they said I could not update my address since I was not the shipper. ThredUP said they couldn’t update it, which just like laziness on their part since it’s their company. One transaction of a mess all together.",1
1972,So far so good: I’m amazed at the clothes I’ve gotten already. I ended up buying another bunch. Sizes fit me correctly and I’m impressed. I tried this out because I hate in-store shopping and can find new styles I have difficulty doing at a store due to anxiety. I have a nice selection of clothes that keep me looking professional at my job and love the selection. First shipment all the clothes fit. We will see how this next one goes...,5
1973,"Simply the Best!!!: I LOVE thredUP!!! This is my one-stop shop. I find the best deals on quality designer clothing AND help the environment. What could be better??? Not to mention, I’ve had only positive experiences with customer service, get rewarded for my loyalty, it’s fun, and easy to use. I can enjoy my retail therapy and build my sustainable wardrobe without damage to my budget or contribution to fast fashion. I’m hooked for life!",5
1974,"Great concept, easy process: Since my first three up order, I am somewhat addicted. All the Items I have purchased have been as described. They arrive quickly. Returns process is easy. The only complaint I have is that sometimes lower cost brands are listed as ""costing more"" originally (before the discount). One dress I purchased was listed at 80$ original cost and discounted to $10.  I liked the $10 price, but this discount display seemed inaccurate. Overall I do love the concept.",4
1975,"Customer service is terrible: I have found it very difficult to get help from support. I wanted to know why a pristine, authentic Celine bag from my clean out kit was not showing up as listed, and I was first told to wait—it was still processing—and then 3 days later when it still wasn’t listed, I was told it was rejected and recycled!  This bag had NOTHING wrong with it and I was neither notified it was rejected nor given the opportunity to get it back. So now I’m out a very expensive designer bag that I would have otherwise kept. And to top it off, the rep was rude. I will never send anything to ThredUp again.",1
1976,"Love the shop but the app is extremely frustrating: A few of the annoying things about the app:
1. Having to log in repeatedly pretty much any time you leave the app and return to it 
2. No indication you’ve been logged out until you perform a search, try to favorite and item and get the login screen
3. Once you login it returns you NOT to the search page or item you just left but back to the home page so you must redo the search and start again 
4. No “recent searches” to recover lost searches 
5. When scrolling through items you favorited if you click to view details of an item, when you return to the favorites pages it takes you back to the top. Every time. Not to where you left off, the top! Just, why thredUP why

Essentially it’s a LOT of extra, pointless effort for the user to shop via the app.",2
1977,Wow!!: I have had no issues with the items to date. The service fast. Returns are easy and re-stocking fees are easy to understand. The website is great for resell items. Good description and details about items. Always double check sizes. The way it is layer out it can be easy to confuse a size French 24 for an American 24. They are not the same.,5
1978,"Amazing!: Love ThredUP for dresses and tops - such a huge selection! I filter on new with tags less than $20 and still have hundreds of options to look through. Hard to spend money at a real store after I can buy this way instead. And as a valued shopper, always getting deals such as free shipping, $5 or $10 my order. 

Yes I’m addicted and tell everyone I know. :-)",5
1979,"I don’t shop anywhere else: I’ve always loved thrift shopping but with Thred up you can search for exactly what you want in your size, brand, color. Literally my entire closet is thredUP, returns are so easy and the best part is it’s sustainable. Your not supporting fast fashion companies with bad policy and cheap clothing. You can have quality clothing at a low price with thred up. Amazing. The best.",5
1980,"Best shopping ever: When I want something new this is my go to place. I’ve been able to buy brands that I could not have afforded otherwise, most of which were new with tags. For example, a new pair of Jimmy Choo shoes for $80 instead of the ticket price of $900. Prada purses, Dolce & Gabbana shirt and Burberry purse, scarf, gloves and rain boots are some other items I’ve been able to afford using ThredUP.",5
1981,One and done: So I bought my daughter some dresses for back to school. I have nothing bad to say about second hand clothes but when they listed items as no sign of wear good condition etc I believed what they said but what I received is in extreme poor condition!!!! There are holes on the back on some of the dresses and extremely worn !!! The worst part is this place makes you pay to send back the clothes “restocking fee” well if you were honest I wouldn’t of bought clothes in this poor condition plus the pictures are horrible!!! I do not recommend this place at all !!! Stick with Mercari and Poshmark!!!!,1
1982,"Best resale store !: I just love ThredUP! It’s purpose to resale gentle used and like new clothing online is innovative and fun. 
The inventory is abundant and stylish. Name brands at fractions of retail costs. They have it all! The care they put into packaging items, wrapped up in their pretty turquoise polka dot tissue paper makes me feel like I’m getting something new from the store! 
I’m not a shopping, by any other means, but they’ve got me hooked!",5
1983,Great app but disappointing customer service: I have ordered many things and have had great things to say about this app and company but when I was sent a completely wrong shipment and tried to reach out to customer service it was very disappointing. Email and chat are the only available ways to connect with them. When I emailed them It said it would take 5 days to get back to me and the chat avenue was a robot navigating me with pre worded statements/questions.,3
1984,"Great service, great products: The used clothes arrive in great condition and in a timely manner.  I get all of my clothes from this site now! My only constructive criticism is that they could work on their search function.  It’s easiest to search with a brand and simple terms (like “blouse”).  However, The search doesn’t work that well if you describe the item (like “green shirt”).",5
1985,"All my packages were smushed... and many that were “delivered” never arrived: Just as the title says. I sent the packages to a friend at my permanent address and the boxes arrived damaged, some were even broken to the point the boxes were open. Not everything that was delivered arrived to the address, I hope there is just some delay in the system and they will arrive soon. Will update when I am able to check inventory and see if the items that arrived were the ones I ordered. Hopefully my other packages will arrive more safely and on time. Until then, I can’t recommend this website/app.",1
1986,"Biggest Scam!: Don’t understand how this has such a high rating when it is a horrible service, sent two bags full of good not worn or torn or misused purses, and somethings even had tags in them, somehow the most cheapest and more worn items made it to the store. Where is the rest of my items? I had sent 4 Michael Kors purses that were in great condition and I’m sure would have sold and yet they were not eligible for sale and did not offer any explanation as to why, the payout for your items are a joke, they give you one amount but somehow it goes even lower, just save your items for other places or donate them and save yourself a headache!",1
1987,"Secondhand bliss!: Absolutely love this app! As a tall woman, thrifting can be tough! Having the inseam and waist measurements available for each item is awesome, and really has helped me find products I love and eliminates those that don’t quite fit the bill! It’s great that you can include your sizes and measurements in a search, but I wish you could include inseam! I’ve loved the first bundle I’ve gotten from them and am looking forward to my next!!",5
1988,"No response: I’ve contacted them a number of times , I sent a clean out bag that had a lot of stuff that was new, shoes, boots, you name it it was in there.. I was not notified that they received the bag, so I contacted them numerous times... they  NEVER replied... after talking to a few people I found out the same thing happened to them! So there’s some shady business goin on... be careful and think twice before you send them ANYTHING!",5
1989,"Thrifting leveled up: Really like the website, app is good. There should be a way to ask a question about an item; sent a DM on Instagram without a reply. Photos of handbag interiors would be helpful. Overall, the items I have received have been of great quality, as advertised. Have sent a few boxes of my own to consign, hoping that they can be of use to someone, no matter how much I may earn back.",5
1990,Where is my stuff or my money???: Either you guys give me back my stuff or process my stuff. It’s been almost a month and you guys haven’t payed me or have any notice that this thing is progressing along! I’ll never in life use your guys plate form again. I could you sold my stuff in the corner faster then this BS..: You guys have stuff from both my kids child hood and you think it’s ok to not even respond to complaints!?  Do not use them!!! Take your stuff to OfferUp and sell there!!! Let another week go buy with out you guys paying me or giving me a answer that leads to results. I’ll file against you guys in small claims court. You guys are shady!!!,1
1991,"Better for shopping than selling: I used this service to sell items I wasn’t wearing back when the site started many ages ago. Recently, after being satisfied with a few items I purchased through them I decided to try their “clean out bag” selling service. They pay far less than I previously experienced and I feel they accept way less items as well. Some brand items I had only worn once, and weren’t accepted. Most likely due to volume, and cost of processing items, I feel one is better off selling through other channels.",2
1992,"Amazing! Great for gift giving also!: I love ThredUp! I have been using it forever! I’ve never once had an issue with something I bought being in bad condition. I love this app/site for buying Christmas presents and birthday presents! I can get new with tag items for a fraction of the price and really save myself some cash!
I hope they expand to men’s clothing soon so I can buy ALL of my Christmas/ Birthday items from ThredUp ❤️",5
1993,"Sold to Thred Up: When I sent two large packages to Thredup with over 30lbs of items i knew they were only going to accept maybe 10-15 items at most and I was okay with that. I sent over 5 pairs of shoes and they did not pay for any of them! These shoes were all barely used and looked new. They pay nothing for the clothes they do accept and it is ridiculous. I wasnt expecting much but even that was lowered, they sell so much clothes at expensive prices but give the sellers nothing, it varies between 4-8% of what their listing price will be. I will not sell to ThredUp ever again and prefer to visit a Crossroads or just give it all to Goodwill.",1
1994,"Sounds great on paper but.......: I was excited to find this site to help clean out my closet and make a little extra money. They charge you return shipping for anything they don’t accept and return shipping on anything that doesn’t sell. They only give you like 10% of whatever the items sell for, charge tax (even though I wasn’t buying anything) on the return OF MY OWN ITEMS and if you want to cash out on whatever they did sell they give you a lesser amount than you earned in sales. Total ripoff and definitely not worth all the hassle. I would have made out way better donating the items and taking the tax deduction.",1
1995,"Love it: I absolutely love this app!! Has all kinds of cute clothes, make it easy to find things that fit my style preferences. Prices are decent, some i would say are a bit steep considering they are a second hand store I wasn’t thinking some things would have been priced the way they are, but for the most part this app is a keeper!! Definitely recommend it!!! Legit one of my favorite shopping online apps. 🥰😍",5
1996,"Prices going up: I like thredUP.  I have purchased several clothing items.  I found the description and condition to be accurate.
The prices are going up though.  I can get the same t-shirt at the store or on-line new for the price they are asking for a used one.  
Overall, I enjoy getting quality clothing from them.  I have been a little disappointed with prices lately though.",5
1997,"Great App, Terrible Customer service: I’ve shopped using the thredUP app for awhile, and I really love it. There’s a lot to choose from and the prices are reasonable. However, I had. A problem with my most recent order. I messaged customer service promptly and they didn’t respond for three days, until my order had already shipped. It’s been another three days since then and I have asked for more help with my order and they still have not responded.

TLDR: Great app with great clothes and prices, but if you have a problem with your order, don’t count on hearing back from customer service.",2
1998,"Can’t rely on size & product descriptions: I used to love this reseller, but, as time has gone by, I’ve noticed a decrease in the accuracy of product descriptions, particularly size information. There’s a difference between a 1X and an XL, and between a Misses 22 and a Women’s 22. Unfortunately, these differences don’t always show up in what you are told about an item on the app. I used to recommend ThredUp to everyone, but I don’t feel I can anymore: too much money down the drain & returns are difficult. Plus, you won’t get all your money back.",2
1999,"Hideous customer service: I have been a loyal customer with ThredUP for many years, but something has changed. They have no customer service available to speak to if a problem arises. I have had my account blocked, and frozen, and my money held hostage from cashing out. I have tried to purchase items and the website crashes and I lose everything I’ve curated for hours to buy. After one hour if you don’t ring up, the things in your cart are removed! It’s a terrible horrible company and I will no longer be a customer or recommend them to other! THE WORST!",1
2000,One of the BEST Ways to Shop: I tell EVERYONE about ThredUP. There’s no reason to buy anything brand new when you can find significant discounts for pretty much any brand out there — from cheap to completely and utterly designer. The only time the deals are the same as retail is SOMETIMES retail clearance prices can match ThredUP prices…but not when ThredUP has a SALE! One of the best places ever to shop!!,5
2001,"5 stars, with some suggestions: I love buying designer clothes second hand for much less money! I love the hunt and the thrill of finding a treasure!! Thankfully you now use UPS (instead of FedEx, which SUCKED)!! Orders come MUCH QUICKER!! BLACK clothes are an issue!!! The way your photos are taken, it’s SO hard to see detail!! I KNOW you can do it because once in awhile a black item’s detail CAN be seen!!!",5
2002,"Seriously amazing: I’m a college student & this app has been a real blessing, seriously. I’m buying clothes for myself for the first time and this has made things SO much more affordable. I’m also able to buy from much nicer brands than I’d normally be able to at a much lower price. Everything I’ve gotten is in excellent condition. Very very happy with everything!",5
2003,"I have been burned with every purchase: I strategically purchase from this site by only selecting items that are labeled as excellent and new with tag. However, every single time I get items with holes, that smell like mildew, are missing buttons or incorrectly listed (ordering a an item sized medium and receiving an extra small or ordering a branded item and receiving an unbranded item). The employees listing these items are either blind, or are instructed to lie in the listings. Either way, if you’re looking to thrift decent items, hit your local thrift shop so you can see what your purchasing.",1
2004,"Don’t expect to see your more expensive items listed: I’ve sent nearly a hundred articles of clothing over the years. Purchased dozens - some my favorite clothing. The last bag I sent brand name, excellent condition heels that I’ve worn maybe twice. These were not listed from my cleanout bag. 
Some employees are apparently getting really nice clothing for free. 
I haven’t used the return to me option because I never had issues. But I have read complaints that even with the return unlisted items request people are not getting them back. Deleted the app. Won’t be using Thredup again.",1
2005,"Awesome customer experience: This app really sets itself apart from other thrift apps because of its great UX, cool features and more. I love being able to hold things in my cart, see how many people favorited something I like, get notified when an item is available out of someone else’s cart. Literally every brand interaction has been great. Love their emails too",5
2006,"Really great if you know how to use it!: I love ThredUP, but I’m also on it almost everyday. I know what brands I like, what’s a fair price (I used to work in reused clothing), and I’m an ambassador which is a more than fair program they have. I’ve gotten some amazing pieces from them. My only feedback is a being a little more on measurements, proper color swatches, and fabric, but otherwise I love this app!",5
2007,"Slow to process items…: The app is easy to navigate and I like the idea of sustainability and seeing able to rework your wardrobe without contributing to fast fashion. However, sent several items and have been waiting months for them to get processed and sold. I think the team is too small for the capacity they’ve gotten. Perhaps a gauge for users to see how long a clean-out kit will take to process depending on the current demand would be great to have!",3
2008,Annoyed/bummed out: My first order came and everything was great. My second order was “delivered” but didn’t actually show up until a week later. My third package was “delivered” to a town I don’t even live in but was still showing up as being processed for another week. Now it’s MIA. I’ve reached out to customer service several times to get my money back (or my wanted package) but no one has yet to get back to me. I’ve been dealing with this for almost a month now. So very bummed out because I loved my first two packages.,2
2009,"WAY better than Goodwill: I got promoted to a job where I am expected to wear business clothes every day. Even though it came with a nice raise, I still shop on ThredUp because I get a WAY better bang for my buck. I could drop upwards of $500 on a nice suit for work…OR I can buy an entirely new business wardrobe full of high quality pieces AND get it tailored for less than that. Love this app.",5
2010,"Best Way to Shop: I try to be ethical about my clothing purchases and I think ThredUp is one of the best ways to do that. I love being able to search for exactly what I want (brands, sizes, materials, etc.) and have also discovered great brands I’d never tried before. I love supporting my local thrift store, but it’s understandably hit-or-miss; I love having ThredUp for when I know exactly what I’m looking for :)",5
2011,"Much improved over the last few years: I used ThredUP years ago but got frustrated with the lack inventory in plus sizes. I got back on the site recently and was pleasantly surprised by the improvement in that aspect & better search and filter features. I do find the inadequate descriptions & measurements of garments to be frustrating & I HATE the restocking fees for returns! But all in all, a good option for a dedicated thrifter like myself.",4
2012,The thrill of the hunt - and you will be hunting for the delivery: Not sure I would do it again after seeing how long it takes to arrive. SLOW like molasses on the uptake. Ordered on 8/1 and still no delivery 16 days later. The tracking shows it has driven near my city and then went last it to 3 different states and now is in a neighboring state. Who knows when I’ll see it. I have 2 orders after that order - wonder when I will see them - Halloween? Poshmark definitely beats them here.,3
2013,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE: okay first of all- i am not one to complain but this was just horrendous. not only was the quality of the clothes worse than in goodwill stores but the prices were outrageous! i ended up paying a total of $150 and have decided to return 11/15 items. i DO NOT RECOMMEND this app. fair warning your money will be wasted as they don’t give it all back.,5
2014,"So Good!!: So I downloaded this because of a YouTuber lol, Bestdressed, and at first I was very underwhelmed and thought “all of this stuff is kind of ugly” but when I found something I liked, I clicked and saw the similar items section and I think that was when it started getting good. I downloaded it a few days ago and already bought a dress! The prices are also amazing, highly, highly recommend!!",5
2015,"Poor customer care: I contacted customer care for correcting item description and wanted to change prices that they fixed lowest prices. Now it’s been sold out already, not responding chatting service, e-mailing takes more than two business days that give them time to my item sold. This is worst experience Since I start consignments.",5
2016,"Ugh sooooo many things wrong with thredUP: Coupon codes don’t work, rewards don’t redeem accurately (it says free shipping and then when I apply my points it still charges me). The last three items I bought were the same price as brand new at Target and were pretty worn. I would not have gotten them here except I needed them & Target was sold out. Also right after I place my order, I find cheaper items in better condition of same brand/size and color. EXACT same item for cheaper that did not show in previous searches 30 seconds prior. This website is a hoax. I have wasted a lot of money trying things.",1
2017,Happy customer: I have ordered at least 5 different times and have always had great luck.  There were a few items that didn’t quite fit but I was able to return the items.  I use ThredUP primarily for my “work” clothes.  It’s great to get brand name clothes at a fraction of their original price.  And a great way to save resources by reusing/recycling items.,5
2018,"Fabulous Business/app needs work: I absolutely love threadup. I wish the app was a little more user friendly. Working on my settings for my goody box is sometimes frustrating and continuing to see the adds and being able to take the whole style quiz again for new goody boxes is unnecessary since I’m already subscribing. Otherwise, I love being able to thrift shop online. I love getting a goody box every two months. I love saved searches. Thanks!",4
2019,"Expensive: Let me be clear, I like this app. I’ve had it for more than a couple of years now. When I first got it, the prices were very reasonable, the type you’d see at any other second hand store. T-shirts of good quality were under $10. Now, they have American Eagle t-shirts for $45 (American Eagle doesn’t even sell these shirts for $45). The prices make it not much different than shopping for brand new clothes, and sometimes buying clothes directly from the store is cheaper than buying them on ThredUP.",3
2020,Secondhand First!: I’ve been using the ThredUp app for quite a while and it’s easy to use and fun to browse. It’s my daily get away from stress as I filter and scroll to find my next secondhand score. About 40% of my work attire is from ThredUp and hopefully one day I can say the majority is. I don’t have time with 2 young boys to go to secondhand stores so the ThredUp app is my go-to source for purchasing secondhand clothing. I highly recommend.,5
2021,"Use to love ThredUP selections and prices: Very disappointed in the increased pricing and sale of some low-quality products. 

I can find new items for close to the same price at Macy’s. Also can’t believe that you’re selling Walmart and target items. There is no reason to buy used for the prices that you are selling some items. Also, shipping costs charged unless you spend quite a bit (I believe $75). If I buy something at target or Walmart I can easily take it back for a full refund. Not the case with thredUP.

I continue to look through to see what’s available  I typically go through and put items in my cart but then decide it’s not worth it to buy from a secondhand store for the prices that you are now charging. 

I loved thredUP when you first came out and thought your prices were great and quality always good. I hope you’ll consider reassessing your pricing and shipping charges.",2
2022,"Great savings: I love thredUP! It is an incredible value for nearly new clothes. I wish that there was some way for the app to learn your likes and tailor what you see to brands like those you frequently search. It can be tedious to search through so many items. Also I hate that there are so many fees now, it definitely makes me think twice before purchasing. As a whole though it is a great concept for good quality clothes at amazing prices.",4
2023,"Great service but ship clean out bags to Alaska!: I think this is a great app but wish they would ship bags to Alaska. Odd that I can purchase clothes from the app and have them shipped to Alaska, but the clean out bags cannot be shipped here and I have lots of nice clothes with tags still on that I would like to sell. I have had a great experience with the clothes I have purchased, but please look into shipping the clean out bags to Alaska - the cost shouldn’t be much more than in the contiguous 48 states and I would be willing to pay a small fee for the difference.",3
2024,"Good experience but...: I like thredup for the clean out bags, and making shopping secondhand easy. What would make it perfect for me would be a way to exclude certain brands from my search. There are a few brands I will never buy because of how they hold up or fit issues. I would love to mark those brands somewhere so I never have to see them in my browsing. I get disappointed when I see something cute but it’s by a brand I know I have issues with.",4
2025,"Works well, some features missing: This app works well on my iPad and iPhone 6plus. I love how there are photos of every item I ordered in my account. I love how you don’t have to click over to new pages; you can just keep scrolling down  Some things are missing: no ability to save searches, auto buy, or buy the reject box or obtain the recycle bag.",5
2026,"Great deals!: I have to say that I really like shopping on thread up.  I’ve been able to replace my entire wardrobe for a little over $100!! I love the quality and the selection is outstanding.  I love getting my polka dot package!!! It’s my favorite.  Thanks for bringing my favorite thrift store right to my house!! Also, With Covid present it’s been a real life saver😊

Seriously one happy customer,
S",5
2027,Great stuff...should have free returns: I love thread up! My only complaint is that in order to get a free return you have to accept store credit. I get that free shipping both ways would probably cost a decent amount to the company but we’re talking about used clothing that may not fit the same as new or may have issues that cannot be seen. I would 100% shop twice as much on here if I could return things for free for a refund on my credit card.,4
2028,"Buy, don’t sell.: Love this app for shopping! I order stuff like twice a week. I wish they had a rewards system though for very frequent shoppers like me. I do not recommend selling though. I sent a huge bag of nice stuff that took over a month for them to process and I only got like $11. That’s only a couple dollars more than the shipping they made me pay. Better off selling to a local resale shop. Really love it for finding great deals on brands I love, this though!",4
2029,"Good for buyers, terrible for sellers: After sending in three large bags of clothes, most of the items sold making over a hundred dollars but due to the minuscule payout percentages and fees I received $0 back. And if your items don’t sell and you want your items returned you have to pay an extra return fee. I would buy from this site but would not send in items again. The app itself works well though, is simple and no crashes.",3
2030,"Do NOT sell through this app!!!: You won’t get anything on clothes you sell. They swindle you and basically steal all your items.

I had sold some clothes through them several years ago and they sent me a debit card. The card never worked and I never got a reply when I tried contacting them about it.

I stupidly gave them another chance because it seemed easier than selling the clothes myself. I sent them two massive boxes of clothing. They only successfully sold a few items and they limited the time they are listed for. So they take literally months to process your clothing and then only give your clothes a few weeks to sell before they donate them or try to sell them back to you at astronomical prices. For real???!!!

The profit they give you back is laughable. They gave me $0.91. Really???? This company is run on theft and deception. Do not support them. What a terrible business model.",1
2031,"Shady business: You used to be able to order a clean out kit and have it sent to you. You fill the bag and mail it back, postage paid. They pay you pennies maybe a dollar for an item that they sell so they are making a huge profit off of your clothes while issuing pennies in return. NOW not only do they want your clothes for their profit but they also now want to make you pay for the clean out kit AND pay a fee to send your clothes in while they rake in profits off of your clothes. No thank you. I’d rather donate to charity instead of contribute to the profits of a shady business.",1
2032,"Changes: I like ThredUp and have used it for some time; most of my wardrobe has come from this site in the past. I will be exploring new options now, however. Things keep changing and I am less satisfied with the service than in years past. The changes in the return process in particular are causing me frustrations. My advice is to check the current return criteria and restrictions before each and every purchase so you don’t get burned.",3
2033,"Great app but could improve: Overall I really like thred up and the whole idea behind it. But the app needs more filters for things like high vs low rise pants. I did not see a filter for that. Also leggings vs sweatpants. It casts too wide of a net currently and I like to narrow it down more. 

Also it would help if the actual style of pants were listed. Example being, old navy leggings. Are they the powersoft? Or something else? This is key for me to know the fit, since the pictures aren’t the best",3
2034,"Addictive!!: I love perusing the thousands of clothes, shoes and accessories at Thred Up!  They make it easy to zero in on the brands you like and everything in your size pops up automatically after you register your sizes.  
I love to “favorite”  items and then wait for a sale or mark down to happen.  They make it easier to afford brands you never could buy new, I mean, without taking out a loan! Lol.

The items I have purchased always come perfectly wrapped in tissue and are like new. 

I have returned only once because the fit was too big.  Print out their label and take to the post office.  Easy peasy!  A credit showed up as soon as it was postmarked.

Love it! Give it a try!",5
2035,"Excellent concept, great app.: I love the redesign of the app, very user friendly. My only request is for men's clothes! 

Update: I downgraded my rating to a 3 for the actual service (not the app, although their search could use some upgrades). It’s been almost 2 weeks since I placed an order and I am still waiting on it. They are incredibly slow and the shipping costs high ($11 for one item) and even then it’ll still take at least a week to get to me.",3
2036,"Just one wish: I fell in love with this app some time ago! It has changed the way I shop forever! I can think of something I may like to wear with an article of clothing and BAM they have tons of options to my liking! My only wish is they would measure the waist of skirts! I love skirts, but they only measure the length, not the waist :( I would definitely be on a frenzy for skirts if I knew if the skirts would fit around my waist…",4
2037,Love This App!!!: I am so addicted to shopping here! The prices are amazing and you are not paying shipping on every single item in your order like other apps like this! My 1st (of 3) boxes arrived and I couldn’t wait to open it! Needless to say I wasn’t disappointed but actually very very happy with the quality of the clothes!! I will never shop full price again!!,5
2038,Not too terrible: So I was excited about this and I ended up placing a couple orders on one day. One came within a week and the second still has not shipped a week and a half later even though it says it ships 3-6 days. Customer service has yet to respond to my multiple inquiries and I am disappointed in that. The quality of clothes I received with the first one was quite good though. I am just disappointed as I wanted the second order for a specific time and it might not arrive for that.,2
2039,"Great company: I love that this company is committed to recycling second hand clothes.  Being online gives the shopper access to filter items which makes shopping so much easier than going to a thrift store or consignment shop.  4 stars because it’s difficult to scroll through all the items.  When you leave a page, you end up back at the beginning and not where you left off.  Dislike!",4
2040,"Best modern and unique garage sale ever: They don’t sale anything more than clothes, shoes and accessory but that’s all a girl really wants! Not only do you get to see what your purchasing but if your dissatisfied you can return (some fees may apply) but I tell everyone about this place. Especially if you don’t mind reusing stuff to help, I don’t know, our environment stay green & clean.",5
2041,"Cardigan Girl: I love, love, love thredUP!  I’ve been shopping them for a little over a year and it’s fun and the returns are easy.  The only reason I did not rate them 5 stars is because of the lack of bust measurement on cardigan sweaters. This could easily be done by thredUP or the seller.  If measurements are provided for for blouses, I can’t understand why it would be any different for the cardigan category. I really hope thredUP considers doing this.  I’ll still be a loyal customer even if they don’t though. 😊",4
2042,"Keeping it a Secret?: Let’s be honest ladies.   ThredUP is such an amazing find, the thought of sharing it with others is a bit tough.   I just came across it a couple of months ago and I swear I can’t get off it.   There are amazing finds.   Always thought - one lady’s throw away - is another lady’s favorite!   Thanks for this ingenious idea.   Next step, getting some of my stuff to you.",5
2043,"To die for, must haves!: I remember last year when thread up opened business I was one of the first clients. I remember my first purchase of $300 I got 50% off that was the beginning of my love! Thank you for all of you and your due diligence. In Mayeye you are the only clothing store I go to! Thank you for all of your work and all of your considering us when you shop!",5
2044,I am having WAY too much fun!: I was skeptical about this site because if I am buying used clothes I want to see for myself if there are worn areas and stains. But the fact that I can select to only see clothes with tags still on them or items that look like they have never been worn changed the game. Now I love this site. The boxes keep rolling in!!,5
2045,"Loved it but now only like because they are getting $$$: I’ve been using thredUP for almost 2 years now, I really loved it in the beginning and felt good about not contributing to fast throwaway fashion like I was. But I feel recently some of the pricing has gotten ridiculous on USED clothes… I won’t buy anything unless they have a sale anymore. You have polyester pants from Zara listed on there for over $100 with their original price at over $300. Give me a break!",4
2046,Returning items: I just got 3 out of the 4 items I purchased and 2 were not as described. I started a return but didn’t do it correctly so I tried to cancel the return and I can not do it let alone get a hold of customer service! I was expecting the pair of pants and shorts I ordered to be as described and they weren’t. The pants didn’t even fit like they should have nor looked like the photo as well as the shorts. Plus I saw I wasn’t even getting back half even for store credit for what I paid! All I would have like is an exchange not lose money cause I need the close!!!,2
2047,"Secondhand is where it’s at: Can’t even talk about it lol this app this company those whom provide the clothes it is amazing I have yet *knock on wood* received an item I do not love. The point system is fun too. The more you purchase the more points you get, options are free shipping, 10$ off an order when you reach 1000 and so much more. If you are a person whom loves to thrift then this is your home from home.",5
2048,"Not Enough Information & Returns  Not Easy: I want to buy a purse, but there are no pictures of the inside.  I want to buy a scarf, but no dimensions are given.  Even with clothing the information is inadequate. It isn’t worth it when you don’t have a printer and you have to go to UPS and even they have a hard time printing a return label. I have a credit, but I am not clear about how to use it and want to make sure I will be pleased with what I buy.  I am planning on sticking with my local thrift shops;  even though the selection is not as good, at least I know what I’m buying.",2
2049,"Need more information: Women’s clothing sizes stink, it’s difficult to know if anything will fit right without trying it on. For most pieces of clothing threadup gives plenty measurements so you can feel confident purchasing pants or a shirt. However for skirts you can only see the length of the skirt. The waist is very important because a size 8 and a size 12 could both have a 30” waist. I would feel comfortable buying skirts here if there was more sizing information.",4
2050,"Its okay: If you’re looking to buy. You will find some good pieces but prices will be higher than your local thrift shop. However, I am disappointed because I sent a large bag of clothes that were in excellent condition. It took a long time for the bag to be processed and the items to be posted for sale. When one piece would sell. All I made was .27 cents for an item that sold for 7.99$. Im not expecting to be paid 50% but .27 cents is just a joke. If I knew, I wouldn't waste my time sending my bag of clothes over and would just donate the clothes or sell them on Poshmark.",2
2051,"Hooked: I cannot remember how I stumbled upon ThredUP but I am glad I did. I have purchased so much clothing within a short amount of time and saved A LOT (bundle option comes in handy here). Out of the twenty or so items I’ve purchased, only one did not quite fit but that was my fault. Said material never works for me but other than that, I am very pleased with everything. FAST shipping and the bags are recyclable!",5
2052,Favorite shopping app: The only place I buy most of my clothes and shoes. If they don’t fit well refunds are always taken back without an issue or customer service is very helpful with credits. I also have sold many items I otherwise would’ve donated anyway and not received a dime. So it’s worth it in my opinion. I end up selling back many of the items I don’t wear anymore.,5
2053,"Expensive: I used to love ThredUP, but after finding other buy/sell apps, I realized how expensive ThredUP actually is... I’ve compared many of their items with actual retailers & some were same prices OR ThredUP was selling for higher/increased prices than actual retailer... plus, there’s no way people actually make money using this 1, to sell items.",5
2054,"Please bring back My Brands option: The best part about Thred Up is that I can narrow my search to brands I know well with their sizing so I rarely have to return things if it’s a brand I purchase from regularly, also generally consistent design quality that I prefer. Please bring back the “ My Brands” default so I don’t have to keep typing in the brands I want to be shown",5
2055,"I like it: I like the app but it could use a couple tweaks. It would be really helpful if you could search my specific Chest/Length measurements rather than just size and knee length, long, and so on. knee length is different for different people and a lot of what is considered knee length is a short dress to me. Overall a good app but would love to see more search options with such a huge assortment of clothes it can be overwhelming when looking for something specific.",4
2056,"THE WORST CONSIGNMENT TO SELL TO!!!: Do NOT send your good quality clothes to these people, they end up staying with everything and you pretty much make nothing out of it.. give it to a good cause instead.  At first when they started I sent clothes and made a couple of $ but now you have to wait till it sells and then if you want the clothes that didn’t sell back, you have to pay, therefore you owe them.. what a rotten company.  People send you their good quality clothes to make some money back, not for it to be taken.  Never again will I send them clothes, they kept hundreds of $ in good quality and unworn clothes.. They are the WORST company.",1
2057,"Atrocious selling experience: If you’re buying you *may* find good deals. Selling is comparable to robbery. Most frustrating part is incorrect descriptions of sent items in aim to pay less to seller or worse - simply list limited amount of garments and steal the rest under pretense of ‘not meeting quality standards’ which is bs. I once send a dress with ripped sleeve and brand new dress. Guess which one was listed - the ripped sleeve one. Real leather garments goes under faux leather description, the brands, fabric info are random - they are not reading labels. 
Never received receipts for donation bags. All this “good for planet” is also bs, they most likely dump ‘donation’ items in the trash and done.",1
2058,Subpar customer experience: Bad customer service. Very slow processing time (2 months for me). Unknowledgeable “inspectors” who do not place appropriate valuations on items (I sent in a pair of new in box $600 Vince boots - made in Italy - and they list it the same price as a Zara $200 coat that was used). A simple search on BBB will show numerous complaints and reports where people’s new/unused designer items disappear and not even listed; many called out their dishonest intake process. There’s a possibility people who open the bags can steal the items. How do people know their submissions are being inspected fairly and honestly? There is no measure for that on the consumer end currently.,1
2059,They’re sending me things I didn’t order!: To even look at the app I had to give a credit card and my sizes and then all of a sudden packages start arriving with clothes I didn’t order and my credit card is being charged for them!! I was moving so it sat in my mailbox for 3 days. Now it says it’s too late to return it. The other package says I can return it with a restocking fee! When I call customer service I get an automated message saying they’ll call me back and hung up on. When I message them it says someone will be calling me and I did just receive a call from a toll free number but nobody was there and it hung up on me!,1
2060,"BEST BACK TO SCHOOL SHOPPING!!: ThredUp is the absolute best for school clothes shopping...I don’t have to torture my 2 boys by bringing them store shopping. There are no tears, no arguments and no wasted time. I can easily find clothes in their favorite brands and right sizes. Click and it’s at my house in a few days! Love it 100%. Plus as a teacher myself, I can afford name brands for my boys and have some money to upgrade my wardrobe every school year as well! Thank you ThredUP!",5
2061,They hike the prices up: I’ve been a customer on thredUP for a while and have brought a lot of items. Everything has been an excellent experience until I noticed that the items I had in my cart to buy went up in price at least $4 and some almost $10 overnight. For this to be a discounted site I don’t understand why they would do that. It’s false advertising.,5
2062,Better off with Goodwill: This app represents a company that takes your clothes and gives you next to nothing. I sent in a good number of boutique and name brand clothes only to receive $5.30. The charge you $15 to send you back your clothes they aren’t keeping.  Otherwise they give it to a charity.  I’m all for the donations but they are ripping people off.  Use Poshmark app...  you’ll earn a lot more!!!,5
2063,"In love with this App!: Always new items, great prices and incredibly easy returns! Customer service goes above and beyond as well. I had a return package that got lost in the mail and they still gave me a refund. Plus, after I contacted them about the return not being proceeded they did all the work finding out what happened. They were friendly, helpful and pleasant the whole time. ❤️",5
2064,"Great idea & some great finds!: I detracted one star because I have felt that the payout for some of the things I have sent in was very low, especially when the items were up to date and new with tags. It also takes a long time for your clean out bag to be processed. 
Otherwise, efficient and easy way to clean out your closet and to score a nice piece now and then. Also good for kids' clothes.",5
2065,"Over 2 months @ still crickets: I submitted items to sell over 2 months ago. When I reached out to them 2 days ago, a rep told me it'll process in 1-2 business days. It's been 2 days and still nothing. They also take a very long time to process returns. This makes shopping a painfully slow process. I know they have plenty of staff and they're a growing company, so what is the hold up? After I get my money back, I will not shop at thredUP again.",4
2066,"Love the concept!: Sustainability baby!
Clean out - I sent my clean out bag and 4 months later I have store credit. Not complaining, it just takes a while to process. 
Shopping- I wish the clothes were steamed so they showed better in pictures. Lots of options to browse in my sizes. I’m hoping to use this as my go to shopping source for clothing and accessories. Can’t wait to get my first order.",4
2067,"Glitches constantly never works properly: They recently changed their format and it’s absolutely awful. You can no longer view the backside of the items unless you click into the item. The filtering buttons just look extremely busy on top. Also, the filters do not even work properly. When I try to filter by brand, it does not come back with brands I selected. Extremely frustrating. Also, their chat does not work from the app. And has not worked for months…app freezes randomly and glitches constantly.",1
2068,"Frustrating to shop alternative sizing: If you shop the petite section only, you’re limited in how you can filter (eg no option to filter by material). If you do a general search, you have to sift through all the regular sizes, which just leads me to give up since some things (like dresses) in regular sizes almost never fit correctly. I wish this app did more to be inclusive for those who need extended sizes. I’m sure the plus and fall sizes sorting are also limited.",3
2069,"Have not had success with clean out bags: ThredUP is great for purchasing, but not good for sellers. For example, a dress I paid $500 for sold for $25 and after fees I received nine dollars. It didn’t even cover the dry cleaning fees. It took months before my bag was processed, and then most items were returned, it may be partly because of the season but again, it took months before my clean out bag was processed. In concept, I love thredUP, but it’s not to make money-  It’s just to keep clothing out of the landfill.",3
2070,"Good concept, poorly executed: Things that aren’t done well:
-Shipping: you get charged extra if you don’t “browse around” for a week before they package/ ship items 
- shipping is unreliable and long, sometimes taking up to three weeks 
- item descriptions are poor, has canned descriptions that don’t specify any defects (something labeled as “fair condition” arrived with hot glue stuck on the sleeve) 
-App can be buggy, it won’t let me update my size preferences not matter how many times I change it
-Pricing can be very unreasonable, items sometimes are listed far above what the retail price is (and this isn’t pertaining to rare items I’m talking about an old carters onesie being sold for $15) 
I’ve tried shopping here multiple times trying to make it work, and overall left disappointed each time.  Time to just stick to in store thrifting .",2
2071,"Why I love THREDUP!!!!: Ever since I started shopping with THREDUP I’m constantly surprised at what I find. There is a sad note here the Jean department needs a little bit of work I recently dropped a pants size so it’s been difficult trying too figure out my size even after measuring myself, my favorite pair of jeans etc etc. or getting jeggings when you ordered jeans those are disappointing days Otherwise I’m quite happy  Happy Thrifting!!!!",4
2072,Thrifting made easy: I love the thred up app. It’s the easiest way to thrift without all the hassle of sorting through clothes. I do wish thred up would tell you a little bit more about the measurements of clothing. And sometimes when you filter sizes you will still get multiple pieces that aren’t in the size range. Other than that it’s one of the only clothing apps that I can find very unique specific pieces.,4
2073,"Find Something Unique: I’m totally hooked on this thrifty shopping experience. I always find clothes here for every occasion. Reminds me of the fun we used to have before chain stores. I had to declutter all my stuff when we downsized. I got rid of clothes and shoes and coats but I’ve upgraded my wardrobe right here. Easy. Reliable shipping and returns. Try this, for sure and tell your friends about ThredUp. You’re all gonna love it!",4
2074,"Poor description of items: I don’t know if the people in charge of listing items are blind but nothing is accurately described. I bought a jacket that was listed online as a women’s large and when I got it, the item clearly said girls large. I got a skirt that was described as black and white and it has no black and is instead brown and green. Worst shopping experience ever and the items are not really that cheap for being second hand. Will not buy from again and wouldn’t recommend anyone buying from them. Spend just a little more and get the item brand new",1
2075,"Rip off: I’ve used thred up over the years and I have made a few purchases without any problems. 
I made the switch to sell items. It took over three months to process my kit. Then here’s the kicker my dumb self didn’t do the assurance .I was like I didn’t need the items anyway. I planned to buy more clothes on thred up with my payout anyway. I sent a huge box not a bag with over 20 items. Not even half of the items were listed. The items not listed were the higher end brands and in better condition. The payouts for the items listed were a slap in the face.",1
2076,"Having to pay for clean out kits??: Waited several months for clean out kits to come back and now they’re charging $15 to get one..? Most people don’t even make that much profit from what they send in. Sell your items on depop if you want cash. You’ll make way more. Or just donate to goodwill because you won’t owe money that way. I assume they are doing this to get higher end products sent in, but if you have a higher end designer product, you’ll make way more selling it on eBay, depop, Facebook market, Poshmark, etc. I will be deleting the app now since I have no use for it.",1
2077,"Smell 👎: Love shopping here, for sure! But that smell that is so hard to get out of the clothes is the worst! I’ve complained and they told me to wash the clothes. Google this issue and you’ll see many complaints about the same thing. Seems synthetics are the hardest to get the smell out of. I mostly buy wool cotton and linen but the smell is there too. Hanging clothes outside after a few washings for a few days helps. They need to do a fragrance free, non toxic treatment on their clothes - I’m sure it’s to treat for bugs.",3
2078,"Amazing: This is an amazing site with a ton of options to buy quality used clothing at really low prices. And they measure each item beforehand 

 REQUEST: Add men’s clothing. Also, please add filter options for chest size!! What is considered a small for one brand can be totally different measurements for another. It’s time consuming to have to scroll and click each item that looks great to find out it won’t fit .",4
2079,"Bundle Shipping Not Practical: They want to do this bundle shipping which is cheaper than normal shipping but it’s been nearly a month and I still haven’t received my items. Usually when I order from here I have to send part of it back which is fairly simple. I should have known better by now but I keep giving this app a 2nd chance. Once I get this order, I will probably never shop on it again. The shipping for this one has taken forever. Ordered on 5/14 and I am “should” get my package 6/3….. pretty ridiculous",2
2080,"This is it, there’s nothing better: I have tried countless app, websites, and real life stores, and there is not a better option for shopping new or used. There’s something for all price ranges, there’s something for any body type, and there’s something for every style. My only complaint is that I miss the goody boxes, hopefully they come back!!!",5
2081,"Great place to shop for thrifters.: Imagine being able to filter through thousands of clothing items based on condition, size, brand, color, price, category and style. Some of my favorite items of clothing were found on ThredUP’s app. It’s so easy to use. Reasonable prices and good selection of tops and active wear in the brands I like keep my clothing budget a fraction of what it would be if I purchased them new in the store.",4
2082,"Love ThredUp but would love a couple tweaks: Love ThredUp’s commitment to eco-friendly and sustainable practices. Have found so many great pieces and had a lot of success selling as well. A few changes I’d love to see them make are: 1.) a way to filter your favorites, 2.) a way to exclude certain brands in a search, 3.) more intuitive/accurate international size conversions, 4.) more accurate/consistent garment specs. With those changes it’s an easy 5 stars!",4
2083,"This is the only way I can shop now.: Seriously, I’m ruined. I find gems on here constantly and make pleasure purchases justified by sustainability and amazing prices, and the packaging 😍👍. I wish the processing time were a little faster, especially when I order for a certain event, but I’d rather wait a few weeks for up cycled style in minimal boxes.",5
2084,"Search feature doesn’t work sometimes: Hi the concept is great but the search feature on the app has some sort of error. Sometimes / most of the time when I search a brand I get all the generic clothing showing up. However, when I do the same on the site it works fine either showing me the related clothes or an error saying this brand isn’t available",4
2085,Why did I wait so long to try!: I’d been hearing about this service for awhile. Finally tried it a few months back and I haven’t been back to a retail shop since. I’ve been so incredibly happy with every purchase and haven’t returned a item. Love that I’m saving money and helping the planet. Recommend this service to anyone who loves to shop.,5
2086,"A brand new ( to me ) closet full !: I LOVE Thred Up. I donated all my old clothes ...the ones that had sentimental value and didn't fit and the worn out ones . And I got all new ( to me) clothes! People are always commenting on how great my clothes are and I tell everyone I get them from the on-line thrift store called, “Thred Up” . Many of my friends have shopped there since then. 
Thank for all you do!
Dana",5
2087,"Love but double check pricing: I am absolutely in love with buying from Thredup. The pricing on some items can be high. Several brands can be picked up at discount stores like TJ Max, Marshall’s etc. or purchased brand new on sale from brand website so it isn’t always budget friendly. I have, however, snagged some pretty awesome pieces, from swimwear to cocktail dresses, that have been in great shape and plan on many more future purchases.",4
2088,"Just OK; kind of disappointed: I was very excited to try this store!  I ordered 4 items on my first order. 2 of them were great. One item, a pair of pants, were not the same brand as listed and they were pin stripped when they were listed as solid grey. The other item, a dress shirt, had obvious stains down the front and on a sleeve. I’ve worked at getting the stains out for a week and though they’re better, I can still see them. None of the items were returnable. I’m hesitant to order again because I don’t have faith the item will be correct or stain free.",2
2089,"Awesome store!: I absolutely love ThredUP! A store with a conscience is really hard to find and it is also a quality that I appreciate and love. The pricing is fair and the pieces are cute! I love that you can set your sizing. I love thredUP as a seller, too. They offer suggested pricing but you have the freedom to re-price the item yourself if you want to. Providing buyers as well as sellers with the info you need about recycled clothing and the impact it has on the earth is really cool.",5
2090,"ThreadUp selling and buying!: Just recently sent in my first clean out kit and am having so much fun keeping up with what’s going on with each item! There is some room for improvement (let seller know when their item was chosen for a goody box, make contacting support easier) but overall has been a good experienceB I’ve shopped quite a few times on ThredUp, but this is my first clean out kit. I love what this company stands for and can’t wait to see where it goes.",4
2091,Love the little dress I just received!: I just purchased a summer dress for a high school reunion and just received it yesterday. It fits perfectly and I love it! The photo of the dress was great and the size was true. I will definitely be on this site a lot! I already have a box packed up to send my things in for someone else to enjoy! I liked the letter that was enclosed with my purchase- felt appreciation for my purchase. Thank you!,5
2092,"The only way got shop: I don’t know when I’ve been inside a retail store to buy clothes.  ThredUP is my go-to place for clothes.  I can find deals, match tops with bottoms and accessorize it all for less than $50.  It’s so convenient.  My only complaint is with the length of time they  take to process refunds and the items I send from my closet to sell.  But the value and the convenience is big for me.",5
2093,"Great way to shop: I have loved shopping on ThredUP. I’ve gotten great items and reduced buying new items. Positives: Easy to browse, easy to check out, lots of payment options, you can bundle items over multiple days for free shipping
Negatives: items aren’t always given descriptions, some items arrived not quite the condition or color from photos, items obviously get mislabeled, shipping isn’t “2 day” 
I have not sent any items only shopped.",4
2094,"Wish the app had all the features of the web site: As someone who has lost over 100 lbs in the last 2 years, thread up has been a godsend. It’s really the only second hand market where you can return items if they don’t fit correctly. That being said, there are great features like auto-buy and bundling which you can’t do through the app.",5
2095,"Mostly great: Thread Up is great if you read carefully, order brands where you’re sure of your sizes, and don’t plan to return anything. If you wind up having to deal with their customer service...it’s an endless loop of “thanks for contacting us, please follow up in a few days!” Buyer beware: they’re definitely not going to follow up in a few days. Or ever. Good luck with that. 

That said, I’ve gotten a lot of cute, affordable stuff from Thread Up and haven’t given up on them yet.",4
2096,"Good, Inconsistently good and really bad.: Can find wonderful designer gently used items at reasonable prices. Have been fairly successful. Unfortunately, sizes aren’t consistent or at least it appears correct measurements weren’t taken. Takes an extremely long time for the package to arrive. In this day of next day Prime delivery, a solid week for orders to arrive is tiresome. Finally, DO NOT EXPECT TO BE COMPENSATED FOR CONSIGNMENT ITEMS.  THIS IS PURELY A WAY FOR YOU TO RID YOUR CLOSET OF UNWANTED ITEMS. This is what I was told when I COMPLAINED THAT I WAS PAID $1.60 for a brand new Antonio Melano $200 suit jacket????  Can’t make this stuff up.",3
2097,"Almost perfect: I personally love the app, the one thing that i would like is for what ever pass items we have already order for it to be like a star on the item or a little note thats says you have already order this item, 
Also can we get mans clothes, im always ordering for my little ones since they are constantly growing, i don't see the point of buying expensive clothes so this is a perfect alternative, awesome job guys.",4
2098,"Great idea, horrible experience: I’ve used ThredUp several times in the past. Several times I’ve ordered from them only to receive juniors sized. Then I must return at MY expense when it was due to their fraudulent advertising. Also I’ve sent in clothing, many of which were brand new. I received a ridiculous portion as payment. I’m not unrealistic about what I should receive but their assumption is beyond ridiculous. I’d sooner donate my unused clothing to Goodwill or the like.",4
2099,"New search is awful: Please fix the updated search function. With the new release, if you search for a “premium” or “designer” brand, you can’t simply search using the “women” category. Instead, you have to conduct the search within numerous categories—women, premium, designer—with different results for the SAME search depending on the category you choose. Terrible UX. Further, you can’t refine the results in a meaningful way, e.g., refine by clothing category. So if I’m looking for a Theory dress, I need to search using both the “women” and “premium” categories, and I can refine by color and size—but not by item type. Just awful. Please fix it.",1
2100,"Great for purchasing used clothes: I've used ThredUp several times now and I'm very happy with the service and the quality of the items that I've received. Everything I purchased seems as though it's brand new. If there's ever anything that has a stain or wear and tear, they will note that on the website. I also love the fact that you can return the items that you buy.",5
2101,"My saving grace!: As someone who has a hard time shopping in store specifically for jeans/pants as I have very particular requirements, I am 4”11 and need low rise pants that are very much not “in” right now, finding those styles on this site has single hands saved me from settling. I love second hand shopping and getting to do that from home is a cherry on top!",5
2102,"Latest Version Removed Useful Features: They removed the ability to filter for new with tags items as well as the ability to see how much time an item will be in someone else’s cart for. They have a notify button but it doesn’t work.
They also have minimal support for sellers, it takes days to fix errors in listings and the only way to do it is through the general support email rather than escalating through the listings themselves. 
Big thumbs down, getting fed up with ThredUp.",2
2103,"Update ruined my saved searches.: When I clicked on my saved searches, which take a minute to set up and perfect, they worked differently than before and I was shown totally different items than before and not in a good way.

Update: have been contacted by the developer so while I was upset about the change I added a star back for great customer service.",4
2104,"Hard to get help.: I have been shopping at thread up for 4 years now. Loved it at first. Quality going down, prices going up and harder to get help with correcting errors I. Orders I have had issues with the last three orders. First two times it was a process to fix, but I was able to do it. The third time the process has changed and I’m stuck paying for a youth medium size pants that were labeled infant 18-24 months on the web site. 1-2 error that can be fixed, fine. Three  in a row, I’m moving on.",2
2105,"Complete rip off: I sent items. They said I could pay a flat fee to get items returned. I paid the fee. This was misleading as Thredup charged me that fee plus was charged more than the value of all the clothes I sent to return the items they did not accept. I sent many high quality, luxury brand products and ended up with $4.40 for 15 items including Ralph, Lucky, Nike, etc. I spent hours washing the clothes and ironing and folding and packing and sending for $4.40. I’m devastated really needed that money and should’ve just taken it to my local consignment. Don’t get fooled.",1
2106,"Failed Return Support Doom Loop: I though I’d been a good customer. I’ve bought dozens of items from ThredUP and sold some stuff. I just wanted to return an pair of shoes which were described as women’s shoes size 8, but were actually men’s shoes size 8 and way too big. I
Possible to locate support. They tried through their automated process to give me half my money back as a credit, which expired in just a few days. I never wanted that, just my money back for a product that wasn’t as described. Silence. Crickets. No support number. Their corporate website says, “We don’t accept returns.” Clearly. 🤦‍♀️",1
2107,"Great app but fix customer support: I love the concept and prices of ThredUp, but info is your weak spot. Your own information contracts itself. When I try to access customer support through live chat, it says live chat is only available at 6 am PST, which is 9 am CDT. When I do it via feedback, it says live agents are available 5 am pdt, which is 7 am CDT. When I look it up on the website, it says 8 AM PDT, which is 10 CDT. 

So according to your sources, live chat is only available starting:
9 AM CDT Mon-Sun
7 AM CDT Mon-Fri
10 AM CDT Mon-Sun

Which is unfortunate for someone who needs to change their order before it ships and has to keep checking in within a 3 hour period because nobody has their schedule straight. Update your information please.",4
2108,HUGE WASTE: Previously when using this app i have made acceptable money for the pieces i sent in. I sent in my entire closet because i was moving and it had such nice pieces i miss them so much. It took 9+ months for any info on where the bags went and when I tried to change the option to send me back my clothes I couldn’t. Anyways for my entire closet I don’t even know where the rest of the pieces are they sent me 17$ for a few shirts i regret using this service and wish I just kept my clothes as I don’t have $ to even buy new ones from giving up the old ones.,1
2109,"I want To Love The Site, But Too Many Problems: I’ve used the site for over a year, and at first it was great. $2/item for a return was reasonable and I shopped alot. I usually got my box within a week.  Over time, the shipment time went to about two weeks with a $4/item return fee which is too high and too long.  It’s IMPOSSIBLE to get customer service help. I sent in three clean-out kits of my clothes last April, and as of January the next year they still haven’t processed any of it. So basically they just took my clothes.  I’m not using this site for business any longer.",1
2110,"Item not as described: I purchased an item because the description said “excellent condition, light wear if any” which was incorrect. There’s a stain on the back and tiny holes in the front, all of which I noticed in the first few moments of trying it on. Either people aren’t inspecting items well enough or thredUP is allowing fraudulent descriptions for items.",5
2111,"Poor customer service and support!: I wrote/ emailed 3 times to customer support when they issued me a credit rather than a refund for my purchase. I never got any response. Their website has become more difficult to navigate. I did not realize they have changed their format regarding specifications that you want an actual refund rather than a credit. They only pay out a few Pennie’s to the dollar if you donate items, but they are still charging premium prices. Descriptions of items are fair at best. Not the shopping experience they used to be!",1
2112,"Amazing!: I love thredup, I have been using it for over a year now. I find all the brands I love and great items I’ve been on the hunt for. I order frequently so the rewards system gets me constant discounts! If you want luxury items, they have those also for a great price. Thrifting is a great way to help reuse items and repurpose things so we have less waste.",5
2113,"New Favorite shopping app!: Received my first order yesterday and I’m absolutely thrilled with all my picks! Even the packaging was 10/10! Everything looked exactly as it did online, they have excellent pictures of each item. I’ve been telling everyone I know how great this company is! 10/10 would absolutely recommend!",5
2114,"Obsessed: So many beautiful things gently used at great prices, my closet is filled with incredible thredup finds that perfectly represent my style and they do an amazing job selecting items for you with the goody box! The app is fantastic, with options to sort, save searches and favorite items, plus get notifications when they’re running sales. I love it!",5
2115,"No order and no customer service.: Placed my first order was over $200. Was supposed to be here yesterday. Tracking showed it was in three states at one time. I tired to contact thred up and there is NO customer service other than a really rude guy on chat that is only willing to give the tracking information that I already had. If that was valid, why would I have spent 30 minutes trying to get someone to answer my chat requests in the app and online. If You love terrible customer service and wasting your money away, then thred up is for you!",1
2116,Prices: I have shopped for children’s clothing on this site for over a year.  And I have gotten great deals.  But as of lately the prices are ridiculous.  Some of the items you can buy new for the same price. And separating outfits that go together for the prices that are being asked are way too high.  I will always keep looking but my spending has dramatically decreased because of the pricing.  On another note…they have great customer service!!!,3
2117,Great Customer Service!: They truly value their customer loyalty and offer quick and helpful solutions. I cannot express enough how much I love using this app and updating my wardrobe finally with some fancy more adult style clothing that I’ve needed for years! I also love the ease of ordering and usage of the app as well as easy no hassle return process. Bravo ThredUP team!!!,5
2118,"First Review Ever: This is my first review ever, in all my years as an Apple user. I had hiccups happen (a package went missing, marked delivered) but the customer service was so helpful & issued a refund. I wish I could’ve gotten that lovely top, but oh well. I’ve continued purchasing and am very happy with the quality & care they put into each package. Makes online shopping fun!",5
2119,"Inaccurate descriptions: Some of the descriptions are way off which causes some errant search results. It doesn’t stop me from shopping but is frustrating. Some of the pictures don’t show what the item  looks like, especially in shoes, which is key to online shopping. 

Im glad Apple Pay is available. It is convenient.",5
2120,Great selection. Amazing value: I have ranted & raved to friends so much they don’t even ask me where I got a particular piece of clothing anymore. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars for an entirely new wardrobe that would have not just cost me thousands but has also saved me months of actual shopping time. Shipping is so fast and cheap that it’s a no-brainer to make Thred-Up my first stop when I need something to wear.,5
2121,Great way to clean out sustainability: I love the fact that ThredUP makes the process of cleaning out and buying used items so easy. Could I make more money if I had the time to sell my own items? Yes. But the business model is solid and the process of both buying and selling is next to effortless. I am happy that I can sustainably update and clean out my closet knowing someone else has already looked over the items and they are in good shape.,4
2122,"Nice app. Great idea.: The pictures could be a bit better. Sometimes is says one color and looks another or you can tell there’s some kind of detailing on the clothes but you can’t see what it is. Also, it would be nice if it told you if the material was stretchy or not. That can make a big difference in the look and fit of the item. 

I also would like if there were more FAQ info on measurements. It took me forever to find that info.",4
2123,"Joyce: I’ve now made 3 purchases from Thredup and successfully negotiated the return process on items that didn’t fit. I found the clothes as described and the return process easy.
I have one suggestion that would have been helpful in my shopping: can Thredup please add the LENGTH of blazers ( body and arm) to the descriptions?  My returned items were all items that were too short for me.
Thank you, Thredup.",5
2124,"Not worth it.: This clothes selling option seems great at first. They send you a bag to mail the clothes to them. Takes 4 to 8 weeks to go through your clothes, unless you want to pay more for a quicker review. Then they choose your acceptable clothes, post them and put a ridiculous price on them to return the least amount to you. By the time you get a pay out, your money is going back to the shipping charge for sending them the clothes in the first place. This is a rip off. Then when you go to reclaim your items, they charge you two dollars to restock the item and a shipping fee. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL.",1
2125,"Great deals, Need more details, descriptions on items: I love thredUP, always great deals on almost new or gently used items, depending on what’s selected, however I do find more descriptions are needed on fabrics and sizes. Though they do indicate for some items, it’s lacking for a lot of items. So when you receive your packages it  sometimes a surprise. Overall it’s always a good experience and prompt delivery.",5
2126,"Ripped Off: You end up getting only 5-10 percent of the sale. They overprice the pieces, they’re selling one of my shirts for more than I bought it for and claims it’s worth $110. It’s not... 

Not only is there a low return but when you cash out there’s another fee. I was fine with the low return until my $8 credit is only worth $6. If you’re looking to really sell your stuff and make some profit try Posh or Vinted. Yeah, you do the leg work, but it’s worth it for higher returns. And when you cash out you get it ALL.",3
2127,"Ok Shopping: It’s nice to have everything in one place be able to scroll through, but the prices are not that great (they really round up on original price). 

Whatever you do do NOT EVER send them anything to sell if you want money. I sent them some really nice clothes, some nice pieces I ordered from them. They rejected the same clothes they sold me even though I have never worn them and gave me 10% of the profit for anything that did sell. Sent 8 items (lululemon, INC), they listed 6, sold 4... my credit was $2.38.",3
2128,"RAH RAH !! I’M A THREDUP CHEERLEADER!: Push ‘em back, Push ‘em back - way back! (Prices, that is…)

I never got to cheerlead in high school but I’m gonna do it now! Seriously, Thredup is great!  The selection of apparel is mind boggling, and the way you can refine your search - from type, style, quality, color, etc. - is so so helpful. I’d say my wardrobe is at the very least 80% Thredup.  I highly recommend checking it out!",5
2129,"Experience: I placed 2 orders earlier in the year and was very disappointed by both. Last week I ordered and I was really pleased! I guess what I learned was order brands that you are familiar with. This helps ensure that the sizing is what you expect. Also, read the description for the condition, colors and measurements. This is how I made sure my order would be perfect. I do feel that the prices have gone up some so look out for coupons and promotions.",4
2130,"First Time Customer: I ordered 3 items. 

1.) I ordered the top in large although I am a medium because I wanted to ensure it would fit, but it fit like a small. 2.) I ordered the bottoms in 9/10 and that is my size. I couldn’t button the bottoms at all. It fit like a 7ish. 3.) I ordered the jacket as extra large because I like big jackets, and this was the only thing I loved.

I had high hopes because my mom has bought stuff from here, but I was let down a lot. I am going to try again and this time order larger sizes. 🤞🏻",3
2131,"5 stars for buying, 1 for selling: I almost exclusively clothe myself in second-hand styles these days, and ThredUP is great for gently used name brands. Selling to them is a different story, however. While they do make the process quite easy, don’t expect to get more than about $0.50-$2.00 per item — and then watch them turn around and sell it at 10 to 30 times that. Either their overhead is incredibly high, or they are making a glorious profit... because they are basically getting their inventory for free.",3
2132,"My Place to Sell and Buy Clothes: I found out about ThredUP from a women’s magazine article, years ago. It inspired me to clean out my closet and make some money! Years later, I still sell my clothes and now buy clothing on ThredUP from different brands that I love! I also love the mission behind ThredUP. Thrifting this way is a sustainable solution to keep clothes out of the landfill!",5
2133,"I love the mission: I love the repurposing of clothes in general. My first order was not the best experience because several items were much more worn than the picture showed and I have donated those to my local Goodwill. My second order was awesome and I hope others will be in the future.
This app is super easy to use. 
Thank you",5
2134,"Scam alert: It is becoming glaringly apparent that Thred up is a scam! They prompt you to send your like new, high end items - only to make it nearly impossible for you to sell them… and… if and when your items do sell, you don’t earn much, if anything, in part due to their allowing customers to use discounts to purchase your items. In sum, apparently it is almost impossible to earn more than the fee they require for “shipping and handling” your items. As a result, the scummy scamming Thred up folks inevitably get to keep all your stuff to sell themselves!!! Unacceptable!",1
2135,"Rip off artist!: They mislead you into thinking you’ll make at least a little off your clean out (what you send in) but then after paying you 8-10% they profit they rest. Then after 30 days all your stuff is “donated”.  In other words they keep your stuff listed but they take all the money!  I searched and found the unique items I had sent in were still listed but I no longer was benefactor… only thread up! They donate to themselves!!! This company is truly bad!  Shop the local consignment stores, mercari or EBay. That way sellers make an honest amount.",1
2136,Navywife: Love Thread up!!! My number one please to shop now! Clothes are so expensive these days and it’s like shopping in a discount store. Just have to read all the descriptions and perfect for any budget!Convenient app and many pay options available. And free kits in the mail to send in your old clothes and get credit. Make shopping for clothing guilt free!,5
2137,"Room for improvement: I love the concept, but the app could be a lot better. I have such a hard time updating account info. I also wish returns were more affordable— after all, it takes a big leap of faith to buy clothes that you can’t try on and you can hardly see. 

BUT. I love that I can thrift-shop online. ThredUp has a much better selection of clothing than my local thrift shops!",4
2138,"Worst app/service I’ve used: I purchased a few items and received a notification that it shipped. I went into the app, and clicked on the “Track” button and received an error. I also got a message that said to download the app, which I’m already in. I proceed to Tweet to both the ThredUP and ThredUP customer service accounts on 1/12 and finally received a response on 1/19. If your app doesn’t work properly or recognize that you’re using the app, at the very least have responsive Twitter accounts. I’m going to delete this app, since it the least useful app I have.",1
2139,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THREDUP!!!💝: I really don’t have much to say, but that I would recommend ThredUP to anyone AND everyone!!!  The prices are ALWAYS right and I have ALWAYS been more than pleased with everything I have bought……from purses, to shoes, to jackets, to dresses, etc…….!!!!!❤️
OH……AND you never have to wait long, to receive your items!!!  I have ALWAYS received my items, within 3 to 4 days!!
THIS IS NO JOKE!!!💯👍🏻💯",5
2140,"My new favorite fashion site!: Go to ThredUp.  I am obsessed!  You can get unbelievable deals on clothes, handbags and shoes.  Plus, they have a Clean Your Closet kit (or label) they send you, free of charge.  You can either donate or resell your clothes.  Each kit is good for 30 pounds of clothes.  Go to ThreadUp and get some new (for you) fashion and get rid of your old clothes at the same time.  I love this place!",5
2141,"Love thred up to buy and sell!: Before I buy anything online I search here to see if I could buy it - with so much waste in the world, I love the idea of buying second-hand. I also love searching for brands we like and finding items we love at affordable prices. Also love sending in items and earning credits toward future purchases!",5
2142,deals to found but…: I give this app 4 stars because I have found some great deals but please know these are consignment boutique prices not thrift store prices! Also shipping takes FOREVER and the return process is frustratingly long too. One thing the site could do better is include more pictures and details about items. eg. like the side view of clothing or the inside of purses or scarves laid out long.,4
2143,"ThredUP is the BEST: I too am totally addicted to ThredUP!  It’s so much better than thrifting. Quality used clothing at bargain prices.  I get numerous compliments on my outfits every time I leave the house.  

I love shopping by brand, size + color, on my phone.  ThredUP sales + rewards.  

I told my daughter about ThredUP, (she’s big on going green) She liked it so much that she said she’ll never go thrifting again.",5
2144,"Not user friendly for selling: Haven’t tried to use to shop but in terms of using the app to sell, it’s terrible. Also when you try to look anything up via a link that was emailed to you, it automatically goes to the app. Won’t let me change the password as it keeps telling me to fill out all the information but there are only two fields - new password and retype password. I want to find out how the payouts work but I can’t find it on the app. When I try to look on the website on my phone, it goes to my app. It’s absolutely frustrating.",1
2145,"Scam: This app promises easy returns, but they’re anything but easy. It wouldn’t let me print my label, it wouldn’t even let me open it for days. I kept trying and then got frustrated and tried to email them to ask about my return and- shocker- that feature of the app doesn’t work either. I’m disappointed because I love thrift shopping and if it were easy to return stuff I’d shop here all the time, but in my experience, if the items don’t fit you’re out all your money because the sizing information is off and the returns are next to impossible.",1
2146,One main complaint: I’ve shopped here quite a bit and love the idea of it. The main issue I’ve had  that I find quite frustrating is that I have received a few things that say “like new with tags” and when  I receive them there are stains or obvious wear. In this case they still only pay for shipping if it is in store credit. I think since it is their employees mistake they should do full refund and paid shipping with no restocking fee.,3
2147,New and improved: I  remember checking out the app a year or more ago and not feeling like I could find stuff I liked. I downloaded it again and here a goody box that will be tailored to my favorites? Ok I’ll bite. I got a lot of cute stuff sent to me. I kept a gorgeous cocktail dress with the tags still on and a pair of old navy jeans and a target top. (Gently used). The prices were very reasonable and they stayed in my suggested budget. I will be ordering another box again soon!,4
2148,Obsessed with this app!: Seriously this is the only place I buy clothes from. They offer affordable prices and the best brands! I’m super focused on shopping sustainably. Thredup makes this so easy. I love not having to deal with sellers like on other second hand apps. It can feel overwhelming at first because there is SO much but once you figure out how to filter and save searches the app is highly addicting.,5
2149,"Great Idea, Poor Customer Service: I do love ThredUP as it makes getting rid of your clothes that is still in a new like condition and you can also make some money. The only issue I have had with them is I had more than 50% of my money disappear and when I tried to get answers no one responded back to explain where my money went.

Update SEP2020

Still no response when I contact customer service. Somehow the money I earned continued to dwindle. I have not bought anything from their site and have no idea where my money has went. I am disappointed with their services and wish I never used them.",1
2150,LOVE: I love all the items I have received from THREDUP! Occasionally pieces don’t fit and am very disappointed! I wish the waist measurements would be on skirts and skorts! They only put the length and size! Which is not to helpful! I have had to return several of them! On shorts they put the waist size  and then I can figure out if it will fit! Have bought several shorts and they all fit! Just a helpful suggestion THREDUP!,5
2151,"Better than retail!!!: This is so much better than physical and online retail stores! I don’t have to spend extra time searching for each brand. I can search the entire inventory for the exact style I want then filter by size, condition and color. I got the app to build an efficient capsule wardrobe, but I love the range of choices and can’t stick to my budget. I’ll be back every month!",5
2152,"Great when it’s working: I have been a long time customer but lately there are To may glitches on the auto buy, bids and in someone’s cart. You can see an item you want to purchase now(this moment) you click on it because, well it doesn’t say it’s reserved or sold. Then when it opens you see it’s in someone’s cart. Well because of the glitch you can’t auto buy. You can’t go to customer service because well they know less then you and couldn’t do anything about it.",3
2153,"Interesting prices: The prices seem to be all over the place. Shoes seem really high to me while dress pants and skirts seem reasonable. The filters are pretty easy to navigate which helps a lot. The packaging is well done ;)  I made next to nothing for sending in two huge bags with a lot of nice items, so the real motivation is just to purge unused clothes and not to make much $. I’ve had good buying experiences.",5
2154,"Why thredUP makes me happy: I used to have money. Not the 1% kind, but enough to live comfortably and afford a few luxuries. My ex left me, taking our money. He didn’t forget to turn off the utilities and drain equity from our home. Huge bummer, until I realized that I felt 200 pounds lighter and no longer walked on egg shells.
But I’m living on a small fixed income. How to dress beautifully and comfortably?

ThredUP appeared when I searched online for silk trousers, and I have never looked back!

There is so much variety and even lovely designer clothing to choose from. I care a lot about the Climate Crisis, so it warms my heart that I can Bundle an order to be more green. Imagine treating myself and family to quality clothing and accessories while utilizing an environmentally sound fulfillment system! Heaven...",4
2155,"Hmmmm: I love browsing the site for cute finds and discovered some great deals. However, after making a large purchase I had to return a few items because they were too small. At this point my experience turned out disappointing. The return process took over two months. Each time I would reach out to customer service via the website, I would quickly get a response and then the “ticket” would be closed. Once I use my credit I don’t think I’ll be returning to the site for further purchases.",2
2156,"Reviews are awesome if you’re buying horrible if you’re selling.: I sent in clean out bag in December and haven’t received anything, no response from any one.  Their customer service is awful. Their getting rich off people belongings. Prefect to shop from. But you’re screwed if you’ve sent stuff in!  They’re good for shipping but not for selling.",5
2157,"DO NOT SEND YOUR VALUABLES!: I have been sending bags to thredup for years and never had a problem. For my most recent bag, I had a lot of expensive unworn items but thredup only accepted the least expensive worn items. When I reached out to them telling them what had happened, all I got were excuses of why the items weren’t accepted (stained, worn, etc). I know the items were not even worn or stained. They were in mint condition. Terrible customer service!! The people probably stole the expensive items since I did not pay for the fee of getting the unaccepted items back. If i had paid for the fee, they would not have stole it!",1
2158,Great to buy from don’t sell to them...: All the merchandise I purchased from them looked great! Close were always in the condition that they described in the descriptions. I would not recommend Selling to them because they give you so little on each item and then they do not even give you money on all your items. Some items they hold on consignment and wait and see if they sell them or not. I just felt ripped off when I sold them my items. And my items were high and women’s dress clothes all brand-name. If they are not going to give decent money for that they will give me a decent money for nothing.,1
2159,"Measurements but still good: I gave it 4 stars because they do have great clothes. One small problem I have is even though they have sizes and measurements, I still find clothes that do not fit me. It’s a shame. It would be nice to try it on first before making the final purchase. Give back what doesn’t fit so that way I’m not buying clothes I can never wear. Other than that, clothes are great.",4
2160,"Quality clothing for great prices!: I LOVE this app! I’m a petite lady and clothes are hard to find for me. This app and site is worth your time and money. ThredUP  does a 12 point inspection of clothing coming in from their sellers. It’s a WIN WIN for both sellers and Thrifters. Quality clothing, who could ask for anything more. I will be shopping here for as long as ThredUP is available.",5
2161,"Love what this app represents: Unfortunately, this app seems to be overrun by greed; selling used items at the same price as the in store “end of season” cost.
   The concept is fabulous. Cutting waste and emissions is beyond important. But selling items that may be insect infested and/or stained and damaged for these prices is in poor taste. I recommend cutting prices. Doing so would do more good and increase sales. I’m giving two stars for the “environmentally friendly” concept, but if really thinking about it this app may do more damage than good.",2
2162,"Classy: What’s not to love?  I moved from a city to live in a small town.  ThredUP brings fashion to my door.   The photos are excellent, descriptions are accurate, filters are helpful, and returns are easy.   I keep about 70% if what I preview which is a great rate.  I love that fewer clothes are going to landfill.  And I have found so many great articles of clothing.  ThredUP, thank you!  You are a classy organization.",5
2163,"Seriously love Thread Up: We are saving the planet by reusing unwanted clothes.  We all receive or impulse buy clothes that don’t fit and then they just stay in our closets!!!
Why not give them to Thred Up!!
I’m loving ordering clothes from Thread Up. I figured out my size, and pay attention to waist sizing and set the condition to “like new” and poof … I now have a whole new wardrobe !!!",5
2164,"Highly Recommend: Thred up is my go to for basics and I can find almost everything I’m looking for on the app. They provide measurements for items which really helps me find clothes that actually fit me and even if they don’t, thred up accepts returns which is really neat. I also love how there are frequent sales so I’m never really breaking the bank.",5
2165,"Needs improvement: ThredUP charges approx 1$ per returned item as a restocking fee. If you buy 10 things and don’t like 5 - thats 5$ just to return the items - even if something was wrong with them (since all returns are subjective to review). Also, you can only have one account per address which makes things complicated if you have a roommate or someone else in your household who would also like to order things.",3
2166,"Great shopping here but app could be better: Great deals and wide selection!  Plus I love purchasing second hand!  All the items I have purchased have been very good to great quality.  

Wish the app had better search features though (more details in item descriptions to help with searching.). Otherwise love!  Appreciate the bundle purchase/shipping too - reduces costs and number of shipments.",4
2167,My order: Shipping speed was much better than I expected because it was free. Items were as described. Not super cheap but items didn’t smell like a thrift store. They actually smelled good. I’m very pleased and will be back. However my first order was advertised as up to 50% off. I received no discount at all. None of the items I chose “qualified “.,5
2168,"Holes and horrible customer service: I’ve ordered from thread up several times now and almost every order contains items not as described. Holes and stains are very common, I am happy to repair minor damage but items are often described as being in good condition with no damage and still arrive with holes or stains.  Never order final sale items - I ordered an 80$ sweater that came with a giant hole in it and was described as perfect condition, it was not repairable, and company would not respond to any emails about my issue so I was left with a very damaged sweater and out 80$. Disappointed in my experiences",1
2169,"Thank goodness for ThredUP: After being in the Navy for 30 years I was in desperate need of a new wardrobe..enter ThredUP! The site saved my pocketbook and afforded me the ability to buy clothing I would not have been able to buy otherwise. The app made shopping a breeze! Easy to use, intuitive interface, and excellent customer service.",5
2170,"I love it!: I love ThredUp. I shop and ❤️things every day, that way when I have a little extra $$ I can find all my favorites right away. I have loved every piece but one. I  especially love that they include the bust size, as that is my limiting factor. I wish they would do this on jackets, and I dont understand why they dont. What good is a jacket that cant be zipped, buttoned or snapped?",5
2171,"Notifications Don’t Work: I really enjoy thread up! They have good offerings and check out is easy. My biggest complaint is no matter how many times I set my notifications I never get emails when my items sell. It also will not allow me to turn on notifications to be notified if something in someone’s cart becomes available. As a seller, I know they are backed up at the moment but maybe they could hire some temp workers to help get caught up.  Its money on the table for all of us.",3
2172,Better than imagined!: A friend at work introduced me to ThredUp about 2 months ago. I was skeptical at first but decided to try it out. It was better than I imagined by far! I’ve never enjoyed shopping until now. I’m so impressed with how easy and fun it is to shop their extensive selection. I downloaded the app and told everyone I know about ThredUp. I find myself shopping everyday now!,5
2173,Scam: Terrible!!!!!!!! Don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I first started using the app couple months ago it was good not yes amazing but good. I sent in my last bag in December got my payout in march for $5.56 all the stuff I sent in was NWTs and when I went to look at the clothes the prices had risen. So instead of let's say free people being 50%to 75% it's almost full price on some items. So if you want to just get rid of clothes yeah it's a good app. But everything else nope don't waste your Money or YOUR TIME. Because they'll do that for you. Their payouts are terrible brand new leather jacket? Yeah you will get 75¢ when brand new it was $210 don't do it!!!!!!!!,1
2174,"Awesome!: Thred up is amazing! I have found shirts on the website that I looked at in the store or needed a different size. Everything I have received is in good shape, and needs little to no attention. I am currently wearing a cute cardigan sweater I got on the site and love it! In these times when we can not go out and shop it feels good to have a place we can find cute affordable and recycled clothing. Thank you thred up!!",5
2175,Never got my money: I really love the concept of ThredUp but the customer service is what ruined it for me. I was really excited to see that they bought a lot of my items and I got quite a bit of money for them but I was never able to actually cash out with the money I earned. I called and emailed them and they were all automated. I tried to do the online chat thing but they were always offline. I feel scammed and I don’t trust them to sell my clothes anymore. I’m really hoping to get the money that I was supposed to receive weeks ago.,2
2176,"Great customer service for buyers, slow processing for sellers: Ive sent numerous bags of clothes to ThreadUp as a seller. The process is easy but slow. I live in the same city as one of the bag receipt locations, and it takes about 3+ weeks from the date of mail for my bag to travel 20 miles. Add another 2-3 weeks before a bag will even begin processing. If you are patient and don’t need immediate money, this is a great service. Love that you can chose to donate clothes as well. The customer service reps are always nice and helpful!",3
2177,Worst session to sell with them: I sent my nicest pieces to give it a try...they passed on $400 sold camisole from Max Mara among many others. Never would I thought they would pass any of the pieces up so I didn’t request for them to send back. There’s no way they trashed them...I’m certain there’s an employee walking around with a few new cute items. Hope they enjoy them at least.  They kept a simple pencil skirt but because they list everything on super deep discount it sold for 0.93 cent. Save yourself the time and take your consignments to a local store where you know someone else will definitely enjoy your gems.,1
2178,"So far OK: I do like the variety so far. On my 3rd order even though I was not given the “new” discount with my first and have been emailing customer service many times. Keep getting very busy blah blah 5 days will respond. NOT. 
One mail was returned saying regrettably cannot be given retroactively. So that put me off didn’t order anything else for awhile. It is not that the clothes are not good. I am happy with that. Just really tired of always saying. There is no go customer service in America anymore. Nowhere. That is sad.",3
2179,"owning quality pieces without breaking the bank: I have been a thredup customer for years. I work as an attorney and need quality pieces that I can wear to work and transition into the evening. Thredup has allowed me to own quality brands that have good material without breaking the bank and revamp my closet. However, I have had a couple issues with inaccurate descriptions online. For the most part, an email to the support team has been able to rectify the situation. I would recommend this business.",3
2180,"Love it: I usually hate going into consignment shops. I am a very tall and busty woman so typically I can't find clothes that fit me and that are in style at my local stores. I love this app because it allows you to filter to your saved sizes and it's all cute, fashionable clothing. I have also sold clothes here and while I didn't get back much, it was nice to get back something for the nicer clothes I was going to donate anyways!",5
2181,"Love this store: I love this store because I can usually find just what I’m looking for , and more, without paying the brand new prices and the items are like new when I get them.  I also find lots of new items too at great prices without the hassle of going to the department stores. And the best part is that I’m helping the environment at the same time.  It’s great because everybody wins.",5
2182,"Terrible customer service: To purchase from is good, but if you have issues forget it.  No customer service.   You get paid pennies on the dollar, and I still have not gotten or understood my payout on 10 items that sold.   Also, returned an item and I still don’t see that it has Been processed.  
No way to call and find out the answers to any questions.   You can chat that never seems to work or is available.     Amazing concept, packaging and products,  but will not last long with this type of customer service.",2
2183,"Searching is hard and inconsistent pricing: I like purchasing used clothes. And for the most part, I like this app.

However, searching is difficult and you have to use their lingo in order to find exactly what you want. For example, I was trying to find a romper for myself. Except it’s not under “romper” it’s under “jumpsuit”. 

The prices are also inconsistent and too expensive at times. For example, I just bought a coat for $50 ($50!!) and it looked nice enough online. However it looked like something someone ordered from wish and thredUP just put it on their site for $50. One sleeve was way too small and the other fit okay. The material was cheap. 

Anyway, for some of the items, it would be cheaper to buy new. That is really disappointing especially because it is inconsistent with their mission.",3
2184,"Out of control: Loved this site at first, but they are getting greedy and out of control. $175 for a cotton blouse that is “gently used with minor fading”? I don’t care what brand this is. It’s used with signs of wear! I have sent in clean out bags several times. I have gone from fair payouts to less than $1 per item. Retail prices are grossly exaggerated. I do much better at Marshall’s and Tj Maxx for brand new. I am getting fed up with ThredUP !",5
2185,"Wide selection: I’ve enjoyed shopping Thread Up for a while  now. While they usually offer a wide selection of items in my sizes, sometimes the descriptions are lacking or incorrect. Read and look closely at photos of the items. Sometimes items are dirty, stained or have odors. Also, I feel the prices are too high for the actual condition or age of some items. If descriptions, cleaning and pricing were to improve, I’d give them 5 stars!",4
2186,"Wow: Whenever I see something that I want, I look on this site and 8/10 times they have it.... and for way less then at the regular store online or in person. I shopped for me and my almost 4 year old and got some amazing deals. People always tell me I have cute clothes.
 I wonder if selling Men’s clothes would work out for the site too. I would love to see clothes for my husband on here too.",5
2187,Restocking fee has limited my use: I used to love using this app to order lots of exercise clothes but they never tell  you whether an active tank had a shelf or built in bra. I am forced to guess by the look of it (just the pics they provide) and I am often wrong. It used to be OK because I could just return it but now I have to pay $2 just for the chance. Why can’t they just provide this information? It is an important detail about any particular garment (especially to a well endowed woman.),3
2188,"love but needs some tweaks: amazing website to get good quality clothing that’s hard to find in stores now. great shopping process, never had an issue after 5-6 orders. only complaint is that they need more detailed images or descriptions of the products. i ordered a guess bag that was a very good deal, but they didn’t mention that the leather was rather worn, which wasn’t clear from the pictures. the bag started peeling badly after just a couple days, so it would have been nice to know that it was well worn. other than the bags, all the other products i’ve bought have been in excellent condition. i’ll continue to shop here!",5
2189,"Not pleased with the smell of the merchandise.: I just recently placed my first order with ThredUP. The deals you receive for new merchandise with tags is amazing. The quality of the merchandise is great also.  The amount of time it took to receive my order was great.  However, when I opened my packages 3 in total all the merchandise smelled of cigarette and marijuana smoke. I am not a smoker and I was extremely displeased with this.  I will of course clean the merchandise prior to my 1 year old wearing, but I should not have to smell cigarettes and marijuana on these clothes.",3
2190,Poor customer service and shipping: I placed an order for some items for my vacation with a delivery date days before I was leaving. It did not arrive when promised and when I finally got connected to chat with a representative I was told it hadn’t been shipped yet. They use GLS for shipping. Never heard of them but they only pick up on Wednesday's.  Too hard to get a hold of someone and shipping is terrible. I tried to cancel my order  but was told I couldn’t and had to wait until it arrived then go thru the return process. I won’t be shopping here again.,1
2191,"Client: I have a problem with my order and it’s impossible to get in touch with customer service. In fact, there is no customer service. The site offers you to “chat” but there is no response to the question you type during “open hours” and there is no email, no phone number, nothing to contact the service. It appears that if you type your question into the chat, you will get a response within 3 business days, but it’s been 3 days and nobody responded. This is unbelievable. I never encountered anything like that.",1
2192,I’m so Addicted!: I absolutely love this app! You get such amazing deals on practically new items! You seriously can’t get this stuff cheaper anywhere else. The customer service is so helpful and nice. They are constantly sending private coupons and deals. My absolute favorite days are when my big polka dot box comes in!,5
2193,"Like the concept, dislike the execution: Initially, I thought it was a great service. But I was wrong. 
1. It takes at least 2 weeks to get your clothes (I would be willing to look past this if it weren’t for my next listed items) 

2. Most of the clothes don’t look like the picture…more warn, fabric distorted, etc. 

3. Their $2 return fee PER ITEM 
My biggest peeve with this is that it’s thrifted clothes - I HAVE to see what it looks like before making a final decision. Feels unfair to have that fee PER ITEM. 

4. store credit no money back. 

I bought about 8 items my first purchase. I made a total of 4 returns. As an I returned a set number of things once, twice, 3 & 4 times before I landed on a few good items. I ended up keeping 5 items total and I have $.70 in credit left. I had initially bought 8 items, ended up with 5, that’s a lot of money I didn’t get back bc of $2 return fees.",1
2194,"They have no customer support and steal: Recently I returned some items from two orders on time. I’d only tried them on, they didn’t fit, so I immediately (that day) returned them. They tell you to consolidate your orders and include all the refund slips, I did. They refunded me for the smaller order but not the other and I can’t even get anyone there to talk to me.",5
2195,"Addictive!!: I don’t know what took me so long to check ThredUP out but now that I found it, I am hooked!! The prices are much more favorable than their competitions and the app is SO EASY to use!!! The free shipping, multiple shopping and return options are great! Finally, but most importantly, the quality of everything I’ve gotten has been really good!!",5
2196,"Great app!: Thred up is a wonderful way to be eco-friendly and budget-friendly! My one comment would be that sizing, especially in pants/shorts, is often very hit or miss. For example, I get very confused as I am looking for waist sizes and see that items which say “27” in the outside description, but then say “31” or something in the sizing section of the item details.",5
2197,"YES! Thredup has revolutionized my wardrobe!: I wish I had been using Thredup long ago! Quality, designer clothing delivered to my door to fit my highly unique tastes interests, all while eliminating clothes waste AND saving $$$! They do a great job with accurate photography of items and accurate, detailed descriptions that make finding (the right piece for me) way easier !",5
2198,Love it!!: I love this app. I love the variety.  It has allowed me to try different things to see if I like them.  The only thing I wish is you could search by key words for example if I am looking for a particular Disney character or something it would be nice to be able to type that in to find items.,5
2199,"would not use again: I ordered a beautiful jumpsuit form Threadup about three years ago. Since then I had ordered a dress and a few more things. For my last order, I ordered my same size that I have in the past (and use at all other retailers). I was so exited and when I received it. Many of the items were too small, which I could say was maybe my mistake - even though I’ve had no fluctuation in clothing size. But, furthermore, items had stains on them or arrived not as described. I probably won’t be using this service again.",2
2200,"I’m hooked!: I’ve been hooked on ThredUP since the first purchase. Now I spread the word, but the funny thing is people are already hip! You know what you’re getting and where from (brand wise). The only complaint I have is I’m tall, 5’8,  and sometimes some items don’t say that they’re petite. Everything else is always spot on as far as expectations go. ThredUP is my go to online clothing store.",5
2201,"Descriptions don’t necessarily match the merchandise.: I was super excited to find this site. Seemed like a great deal and I focused on items marked, Excellent condition, might even mistake for new. My first of three orders arrived today and the hem was completely out of one leg. When I looked at the image of my order and zoomed in I could see it loose in the image. I was bamboozled by the description. I will have to wait and see what my other two orders  look like before I decide if I’ll attempt another order.",3
2202,"Love buying!!: I have bought 5 orders mostly clothes from anthropologie where I worked. I have been sooooo happy with the items,I’m getting gorgeous pieces for around $10 -$20.  It’s sort of an addiction. I have never sold items, that’s where I’ve heard some dicey reviews where people are not happy with the consignment process. So I am just buying and loving it, would recommend for sure!!",5
2203,Non existent customer service: Ordered a selling kit which never arrived. Then emailed about it and received no reply for several days.  The chat with customer service feature in the app has not led to a human response either. Very frustrating initial experience thus far.  I certainly would not buy anything from Thred-Up given the slow/nonexistent customer support response time.,5
2204,"Slow shipping: My selling experience has been fine in terms of how easy it is as I just need to send all in a bag. I’ve made purchases thus far but the shipping is so slow. I’m still waiting for the item I bought more than 10 days ago. The delivery date keeps changing. The item is to come to Chicago from WV. It went to IN and went up to WI. I am not a logistic person but it doesn’t make sense to pass Chicago and go up to WI. It is supposed to be handled by FedEx. They should know how to move things around. 
I may still sell stuff but not buying.",2
2205,Much love!: I adore ThredUP!  This store allows me to purchase gently used clothing for cheaper which has greatly helped save me some cash on my weight loss journey. The store also allows me to donate my used clothing to those who could benefit the most from it. Browsers also have the ability to sell their own clothing. This is a user-friendly app and the store is one I will continue to purchase from.,5
2206,"Nice but...: App works well, however you can’t look at the size chart and the Buy and Bundle doesn’t work. 

It’ll give you an option to buy and bundle at check out, but it doesn’t register your order to the bundle system. 

I’ve tried it three times. The first time I thought I’d made a mistake, second time I wondered if it was still my fault, third time I knew I’d done it right. Twice it wasn’t important enough for me to take action, but when I tried, I had to cancel the order. Then finding the items again was hard. 

Customer service is generally nice and the ability to chat with them on the app is nice. 

I would, overall recommend the app but I’d advise caution with using the ‘buy and bundle’ feature - don’t expect it to work.",4
2207,"Never received - wouldn’t recommend: Was excited to order and see what this was all about. According to their site, it would be “styled and shipped” in about 3-4 days. Over 10 days later, I hadn’t received any updates and the box still hadn’t been shipped. 
I had to reach out to customer service multiple times - receiving a message that they were still working on “stylizing the box”. 
It is now over two weeks and the only update I have is an “in transit” notice with an estimated delivery of two days ago. 
Communication is poor, delivery is slow - well it is non-existent. Maybe one day I’ll see it...",1
2208,"like description of sizes, fabrics: your second hand clothing is in great condition, it really helps that do a good job best as possible to describe fabric, bust waist and length.  in some brands i am 16 while in others 18,  my mom who is a seamstress makes it all work out, otherwise i’d be returning more items.  i have become better at measuring my self and choosing better.  I wish free shipping for 2nd month feature would come back.  I dont see it available no more.",4
2209,"Good quality for brand names: I mean, you can’t beat it. Good quality items for brand name stuff for ever growing kids. Most of the prices are fair. I’ve seen stuff listed that’s almost always cheaper brand new in the store. But overall, for jeans, and shorts...it’s a bargain, and the items are near new. My only gripe is, I can’t seem to get a response to a question I have and submitted. It’s been a week. Oh well. I’ll still continue to shop the site.",4
2210,"Excellent product, small glitches: Love using thredUP. Sustainability is so important and I really love that this makes that possible.
Minor glitches in the app for sure. Maternity wear as a search does not always work and selecting the maternity option doesn’t always hold. But usually you can still find what you need.

Excellent app.",5
2211,"Love thrifting, not the rewards program: I love thrifting and window shopping on thredup. However when I do end up purchasing, thredup doesn't allow me to stack my rewards on top of sales/promos. I understand if you can't use different promo codes but I should be able to use my earned rewards as I like. You might as well just shop with the promo codes, the reward points don't do much.",4
2212,"Love the service, only a few issues with the app: Overall, I find the app really thorough in functionality (in some ways, more than the desktop version) and pretty user friendly. My only gripe is that using the customer service chat causes my app to crash very often. I end up using the desktop version if I need to speak to customer service.",4
2213,"Used to be better: I don’t love the reward program. We earn points to redeem for money off, but then it’s never eligible to be used with the constant ongoing sales. Feels bait and switchy. Pick free shipping rewards I guess since discounts won’t work. Also disappointing there’s a charge now for clothing being submitted. I’ll just donate to a thrift store. Not worth paying for someone else’s inventory. ThredUp used to be better. Not crazy about the changes made.",3
2214,"Descriptions need help: Not good for women’s clothing - unless it has tags on it, don’t expect good condition. Most of what I have ordered that is in a “like new” condition I have returned because they either clearly don't know what the new product should look like (ie - activewear that clearly had been stretched out) or measured inaccurately. I also find their descriptions and measurements lacking in general. Ive decided I’ll just look for new things on sale- at least then I can return it without losing money or trapping it in their credits.",2
2215,"Horrible: I bought 3 items on here. 2 did not fit the way it was supposed to and one was described with such little detail and condition was listed as excellent when it really had more flaws. They didn’t mention the jacket I got had shoulder pads on it and the items tags were not listed in photos either. This is my first time shopping on here, they want 11 dollars for ME TO RETURN IT. So not only did my items not work out but now I have to pay to return. If I would have known this I would have never even purchased anything. Ridiculous.",1
2216,"Poor Value: This is a horrible place to sell clothes. I sent hundreds of dollars worth of clothes in and got about $12 back. I can see what they pay me and what they charge for the clothes and it’s a super high markup. Also they won’t give any credit to sellers for certain brands, but then sell the items anyway, sometimes at higher than new prices (or Old Navy and Shein). They need to do better for reimbursement to compete with other used clothing stores or other apps. I would not recommend.",2
2217,"ThredUp is great but the app not so much: I adore ThredUp and I was regularly using the app, but after getting an iPhone 14 plus, I couldn’t figure out why the battery was dying so fast. After speaking with apple support, they suggested I delete the apps that were listed as using the most battery, and sure enough my battery life improved DRASTICALLY after deleting the app. My phone went from 100% to 33% overnight just from having the app installed on my phone",3
2218,Pay out rate is ridiculous: The amount they pay out for items is ridiculous. If something sells for $20 and I get less than two dollars for it that hardly seems right. I might as well just give it away. Plus I’m looking at my account it says I’ve sold three items adding up to over six dollars and it says I only have four dollars as a balance. At this point I am probably just going to give up. But I sent them nice stuff that I’m sure I could’ve given away to someone I know- instead of making two dollars off each piece.,1
2219,When will my order ship????!!!!!!: I placed an order 8/9 for a 8/28 wedding. When I placed the order NOTHING said it would be delayed! They do say you can add to your bundle and get free shipping. I had though that since this order was over the free shipping about if I ordered something else it would fall under this umbrella for free shipping. As of 8/23 it hasn’t shipped nor can I get an answer when this will ship. When I did speak to someone on 8/19 I asked if I could pay for expedited shipping. They said they didn’t offer that. Four days later the order still hasn’t shipped!!,1
2220,"Questionable tactics: Although I do enjoy shopping on this app, I have noticed that they often send me emails with clothing items that are “chosen for me” whose prices are significantly lower in the emails than they are in the app. If not for my painfully tight budget, I probably wouldn’t even notice this, so I have to wonder how many people have been fooled by this tactic.",5
2221,Great app: I love thredUP! The only thing that would make it better is being able to search by measurements. Without standardized measurements I have found that I am better off buying by measurements than the tag size. Being able to search using measurements would make my experience so much more enjoyable!,5
2222,"Loving this option!: I love this app/service. I have opted to receive goody boxes and love the items that have been put in there for me. It’s so much fun opening the box to see what’s inside. The stylist has done an excellent job finding pants that actually fit me, especially in the length! The brand names they’ve chosen have also been excellent. All of my clothing has looked brand new so far!",5
2223,"Effective Thrift: I enjoy shopping on Thread Up because it’s easy to filter sizes, categories and brands.  I also appreciate the measurements, which makes online shopping less of a guessing game. I have gotten some of my favorite items on this site. It is far more organized and easy to navigate than other similar sites.",5
2224,Tredup always mail your merchandise the same you make the purchase: They don’t take time my order they mail my merchandise the same day I order 😇💖 but the only problems those merchandise are to expensive 🤭 the price i payed at tredup i can also go Aventura Mall 🙄. Tredup as a second hand thrift shop work on those prices cause you’re loosing customers 🤨 I’m one ☝️ of them.,5
2225,"Great App, but...: This app is great for being able to filter down to exactly what you are looking for.  It’s so great to search easily through so many items and buy from one company, rather than picking through individual listings on eBay.  The prices vary quite a bit, so you have to really look for deals.  I am incredibly disappointed with my first order where I ordered a scarf that was new with tags to find I paid more than when the item was new in the store.",3
2226,"Bad review -lack customer service: I was so excited to utilize this new app my first order was $152 and I have been trying to obtain contact with customer service for a few returns and no assistance.  A lot of reading but no support.  I have now passed my 7 grace period.  They say each parcel comes with a return label-not true I received three separate packages for one order and none of the ""bags"" have a return label.  I am between a size 12/14 so I was happy to see so many options but be warned the return policy experience I had was horrible.  I have lost out on $78.  WONT BE USING AGAIN!   Hopefully when I loose weight I can wear them 🙄",1
2227,"Great opportunity to ratchet up your wardrobe: Overall, I love ThredUP and have purchased several great finds. It’s fun to shop the massive collection, you can’t beat the prices, and it feels good to recycle. I wish there could be more information about the items, sometimes the measurements and sizing are off (shrinkage probably), so the restocking fee for returned items is a pain. But again one can find good deals here and endless browsing entertainment.",4
2228,Worst customer service: It’s impossible to get a customer rep on the phone. I don’t even think they have an actual phone number. So you are forced to use chat and while waiting for an hour it disconnects you and tells you they have no agents. Then you email them and they don’t responded for a week and their response doesn’t answer your question. I purchased a shirt 30 days ago and it hasn’t shipped yet. I would love to blame this on Corona virus but their customer service was terrible waaaaaay before this. Stick to poshmark and other services. These people don’t care about their customers.  At.  All.,1
2229,"Worst Consignment Experience!: I have been a long time consigner at retail consignment stores for both my kids clothing and my own.  I decided to try Thred Up and sent in two full bags of clothing and accessories.  These items were many name brand items( J.Jill, LuLaRoe, Clarks) etc.  My payout, $3.10, really?  So disappointing, won’t be back to sell or buy again.  Back to selling on EBay, you just lost a customer.",5
2230,"Ripped off: All the excellent items I sent in by Lands End, Loft, J.Crew, and others , never were processed in my package. I am angry with myself because I read the reviews where many people stated that they were ripped off. No response from customer service. No phone number to call. People just decided to take what ever they wanted from my stuff. That’s very upsetting. I won’t be doing that again.",5
2231,"Obsessed with ThredUP!!: I am absolutely obsessed with this company! I was skeptical at first, having never been much of a thrift store shopper myself, but it exceeded all expectations I had. My orders get to me very quickly and the quality of the pieces is crazy good! Some of the items I have received that say “gently worn” could totally be mistaken for brand new! Practically everything in my closet is from this website!",5
2232,"Have been disappointed lately: I appreciate thredUP as a way to avoid forced labor and slavery in supply chains as well as being better for the environment. However, as of late, prices have been increasing, promo codes rarely work for me, sales don’t apply to all that much and now there are restocking fees as well as $9 return shipping. Overall, it is making it difficult to shop at thredUP. I continue to do it simply because of the reasons stated above, not because I have been so pleased in recent months.",3
2233,"Horrible place to sell: Well you can usually find some OK items on this site, selling is absolutely horrible. I sent in two bags with 20+ items in each and on one bag, they only excepted 4 items. I have no clue what happened to all the other items and they were really nice clothes. Out of these 4 items they paid me $2. On the second bag I sent in 20+ size 10-11 shoes. Ranging from work shoes, boots, flats, etc. They accepted none of the items, I have no idea where they are and I got $0. Would have been better off on a different site. So I would absolutely not recommend selling with them at all.",1
2234,"Great discovery.: ThredUP has been such a pleasant surprise to discover. Can get a a refresh on clothes anytime for a fraction of the price. Seeing as after a few wears an item typically isn’t as exciting to wear, this is the perfect solution. Just search a favorite brand or style and typically something of interest will be available. Fast and efficient with easy returns.  Love it!!",5
2235,"Was A Fan...not anymore!: I have been ordering from Thread Up for a few months and loved it.....until the restocking fee for returns showed up on the app. I had 50/50 luck when it came to things fitting, as is the risk when shopping online. I was comfortable ordering because I knew the return process was so easy. I will not shop Thread up anymore because of the restocking fee!!!!!",5
2236,This company is a joke: I have been trying to purchase an item for three days and someone is holding it in their cart. I was supposed to be notified after 24 hours when the item was no longer reserved and they failed to do so twice. Im so done. No email or notification on my phone ever. If you can't afford to but stuff don't online shop.,5
2237,"Best site for fabulous clothes, amazing prices: I've pretty much stopped shopping anywhere else, I don't need to. With the incredible selection, quality of brands, and free shipping I can indulge my love of clothes with no guilt. I turned about three or four people at work onto thread up. I'm called the Thredup evangelist! 😎 
Oh and I'm getting ready to ship off three huge cleanup bags. My closet will be filled only with the best!!",5
2238,"Amazing quality!: Have been a customer for a few years now. Each piece is high quality and customer service is top notch if there is a problem (but I’ve only used it once). Prices are great and it’s easy to order. I can always find something amazing. My kids love it, too. Much, much more fun than schlepping to an actual store to then pay retail.",5
2239,"Good app, bad consignment shop: 5 ★ for the app - works as it should, intuitive, and looks nice

4 ★ for how easy it is to request a selling bag, and ship my clothes and shoes off

1 ★ for customer service … I called them with questions and they said they’d call me back; never did. I sent an email, got an automated email response from a senior exec, but again never heard back on my questions.

1 ★ for consigning/selling experience. I sent in 3 bags with around 50 items each. All the items were in “excellent” condition, in season, in style, and Many with tags still on. Total payout across both selling methods was less than $50.  Most items (many with tags intact) were either never accepted or not attributed to my account.  Since they don’t account for number of items received, number accepted, and number rejected, it feels like items went into a black hole or robbed.",2
2240,"Great company.: I was so excited to receive my order. It had been so long since I had anything new. When I got my order, I was so disappointed because the jeans were skinny incorrectly marked. I contacted customer service and they gave me a full refund. No questions asked. Absolutely wonderful thank you so very much five stars.",5
2241,"Seller be aware: I recently decided to give it a try and and sent in a bag full of items.  I read a lot of negative reviews about not getting enough money blah blah blah.  I was going to donate anyways might as well see what money I could make. Well they got my bag mixed up with another bag and has taken a week to try to figure out what was mine and what was someone else’s. So not only are mine items mixed up but also someone’s else’s. It is a very  unorganized company. Still, I am missing items and they could really care less.  It was a complete waste of time for $10. Just donate!!!!! You will get a better write off on your taxes.",1
2242,Good not great - beware of sizes vs measurements: I do like shopping with thredUP but my constant issue is the size on the garment vs the measurements done by thredUP are inconsistent. I’ll buy something using the measurements provided and they’re usually wrong. When buying Final items you’re stuck with a garment that’s too small most of the time! Please fix issue with your employees so that there’s consistency throughout!! I’m losing confidence and more importantly money with current inflation!,3
2243,"Omg! Love it.: Thred up is not only a great way to buy clothes that were gently worn, but it is a wonderful place to recycle your own clothes and bags that you no longer want or need. I have been doing this with my teens clothes because their minds change often about what styles they like. I like it because I can find the designer name I love at a reasonable cost!",5
2244,"Restocking fees are a bit high: You better like the items you purchased because they will charge you $3.99 PER item to return them. And consignment?  Let’s just say they have figured out all sorts of charges and fees. You had better have designer items to sell because the likelihood of making money is slim. On the other hand, if you are looking for brands you know, you can score some good deals when buying clothing.",3
2245,"Cost so much when return: Bought 2 dresses with the total of $54, 1 does not fit well but condition and quality was ok. The other dress is in poor condition but described as excellent condition; the shape could not hold up, 1 side of hem is higher than the other side and showing the lining layer. Returned is only free when  accepted as store credit; otherwise have to pay $10 or so to return in addition to restocking fee for 2 of $7.98. First time testing out this store and definitely never come back. I’ll use up the remaining credit and will never ever come back.",1
2246,"Perfect 1 Year Ago: Unfortunately they seem to have had to change to the times and aren’t quite as perfect as I feel they were a year ago+. They charge for sending your clothes to be thrifted, barely pay anything for them anymore, and the prices have definitely raised. I still love them dearly but things aren’t quite as amazing of a deal anymore.",4
2247,"Bait & Switch!!!: This outfit has seriously gone rogue. You put something in your cart at the published sale price and two hours later, the item is no longer at the sale price even though the sale is ongoing! What kind of nonsense is this? I am fed up trying to purchase anything from this app. This is really bad faith  and unbusiness like! I am considering lodging a report with the Better Business Bureau but I don’t know if it will matter. I am deleting this app as soon as I use up my store credit. I don’t need this frustration and dishonesty just trying to shop!",1
2248,Things to think about: I think many things are adorable but the prices are high. I would love to thrift more and not buy used but sometimes I find better deals at a retailer than I can find on here. Also a couple of things in my first order were smaller/shorter than expected.,5
2249,"Greatest place to shop ever !!!: ThredUP was the greatest place to shop that I ever was Blessed with. I receive compliments everyday because of my clothing & shoes. I’m a 65 year old young looking grandmother that sports some of the coolest Threads ever....what more can I say 
       “ I  LOOK FLY” 😊 all because of the ThredUP Gang...❣️
And by the way, Great Customer Service also.  Love you ThredUP ❤️
                                         Thank you Inell",5
2250,"Descriptions of garments’ condition can be iffy and customer support is nonexistent.: Overall- I love thredUP. The prices are fine, the shipping is fast. But about 1/4 of the time, the item I get doesn’t match the condition description given. Beyond that, there is virtually no customer support. If you think you’re getting free shipping based on rewards tier, think again; it’ll never ever show up in your cart, and you’ll never be able to get ahold of someone to fix it.",3
2251,"Addictive!: I really love scrolling through the ThredUP app! 
I’ve found so many fantastic pieces that I can mix and match with my wardrobes for a quarter of the original price. I’ve also found some pieces that I wouldn’t necessarily Have been able to find in a store this season, which is also great. Searching for gems can be addictive. 
I’ve returned items and it’s always been a very easy process. 
My one issue is that I wish when an item is marked as “good with some signs of wear” that they’d take a picture of the issue so I can decide for myself if I want the piece or not. 

Overall, I recommend the app to everyone. I’m definitely addicted…",5
2252,Amazing app: I love ThredUP SO MUCH I’ve recommended it to countless friends and they all use it too! The formatting and specific filters are really convenient. If you only want to see size XL skirts made of chiffon you can do that! They have really great brands too. The whole organization is very environmentally friendly. ThredUP is my favorite place to shop or just browse.,5
2253,"Great products, TERRIBLE shipping time!: I’ve ordered several items from ThreadUp and have been pleasantly surprised.  BUT it takes 2+ weeks to receive your items so if you are looking for anything for a special event or have a time crunch do some planning. I get the mission of the company but taking more than a week to receive items is ridiculous.  ThreadUp is not my go-to because of this but hopefully they will figure it out.",3
2254,"My favorite!: Thred up is my go to place when Im in need of clothes. There’s so much to choose from that I could look for hours! I am always recommending Thred Up to all of my friends! It’s the best!

Also have to say their customer service is amazing. So quick to reply if you need help with anything. Just an overall great experience!",5
2255,"The cutest best priced items: I am totally in love with ThredUP. I’ve purchased multiple times with them and every item is exactly as described. Besides I always find very unique items for an unbeatable price. However, I wish they provided more details on their sizing especially for coats and skirts. Other than that amazing team and amazing deals",5
2256,"Get in on this store: I’m almost too into it. I browse a lot: beats doom scrolling the news. Searching (and saving searches )is easy. There are usually only two photos of the items, front and back with very limited zoom function. 
ThredUP has a huge amount of promo points and fresh deals regularly.",5
2257,"Love the concept, hate the returns: I primarily shop second hand instead of fast fashion. I love the concept of ThredUp but unfortunately with last few orders the clothes don’t fit well and I have to return them which is a $9 return fee if you want original payment method back versus store credit. This discourages me from using them in the future since I typically have at least 1 item from each shipment that doesn’t fit well.",3
2258,"Frustrating: I use several resale/shopping apps, but had taken this one “out of rotation” on my phone.  But today I’m on the hunt for something specific so I pulled it out of the cloud.  

Now I know WHY it was “sent away.”  I spent a while trying to shop for my item and could not get the search filter to work smoothly.  It would pull up things I had not specified (color, style, CATEGORY...?????). Gave up.  Poshmark, Tradsey and Mercari are far easier— less cumbersome— to use.  

Bye, Thredup- back to your cloud...",3
2259,"ThredUP is cool but not the app: I think thredUP is awesome, but I have so many issues with the app. It often won’t open and it’s hard to look at what I’ve ordered or sent for return. The search function is also not great, I can never seem to be able to search for things that aren’t in one of their limited categories. 
Also, it’s impossible to specify S/M/L sizes differently for top and bottom. I love not buying new, but unless you’re shopping for specific brands this isn’t the easiest user interface.",2
2260,"New wardrobe: This app makes it so easy to shop for exactly what I want. I can filter my selection down by sleeve length and collar type. I like having the measurements of the garment in the description. I can pick my favorite materials and it brings up the higher percent of my favorite material as first on my list. Try it out, you will be hooked.",5
2261,"Long processing times, low payout: I sent in my bag in May and it wasn’t processed until November.  All of the items in my bag were very summery. Since the processing of my 9 items took 7 months, the clothes were wayyyy out of season after their delays. 

ThredUP only puts clothes on the market for a month or so, which meant my articles basically had no chance of selling. 

When I reached out to them to ask if they would extend the listing time, they just responded with a boiler plate email and we’re no help at all. I’ve sold 3 items and made $3.63. I would have much preferred to donate the clothes at this point.",1
2262,"Register your bags or expect NOTHING: I hadn’t used ThredUP before. A friend gave me two of her bags which I loaded with expensive clothing. I made the mistake of not keeping a list, photos of the items or the shipping label. I sent them in not knowing I had to register the bags. None of the items got credited to my friends account. I see the items on the site for sale so I know they were received and sorted. I even provided the specific thredUP item numbers to help them identify my bags.  Customer service is essentially absent. Emails go unanswered and the chat is ineffective.  They won’t be getting anymore of my items.",1
2263,"Awsome quality in a timely manner: I have been ordering from this sight for the last year and have never had any problems with a return or receiving my merchandise . I love this sight and highly recommend for everyone who loves to shop at a much lower price then the clothing is worth . Huge variety , delivered quickly, lower priced but great quality clothing . Can’t go wrong on this sight it’s awsome!",5
2264,"Sizing: I like some things I get from them but others not so much. Most items are not accurately sized. I know this because I sell vintage clothing as a hobby and have to accurately size the clothes I sell. I have to return a lot of items because of this and they charge a restocking fee, and a shipping fee unless you take a store credit. My advice is really look over everything about a item or buy brand sizes that you know fit you. I prefer the old fashion brick and mortar thrift store to Thread Up.",3
2265,"Amazing !: I like to think of Thred Up as Goodwill in app form, this place is great! I shop on here regularly and even if the info of the item says worn when I receive it and investigate you can barely tell! I get compliments all the time at work on my new clothes and I always refer them to here! I work at a bank so I have to dress up every day, this app helps me to not spend a fortune on clothes!",5
2266,"ThredUP customer service: ThredUP is a great place to find rare clothing but the customer service needs work. They also need to use UPS instead of FedEx. At least with UPS, I can have my packages held at the ups store instead of taking a chance that someone is going to steal my packages. There’s a problem with packages getting stolen in my building. It’s ridiculous that a customer service representative told me to file a police report for a stolen package.",4
2267,"Fantastic all around: Great shopping experience: relaxing, fun, easy to use, great deals. I recommend ThredUP to all my friends. I’ve done in-person consignment and thredUP blows that experience out of the water. It takes a bit of time to figure out your sizes and fits, especially if you get more adventurous and branch out to new brands, but the return policy makes it easy and worth it.",5
2268,"All around bad: I give no stars if I could. I received a new bag where the box was completely destroyed and the item inside was not even wrapped, just placed inside. I’m glad the bag wasn’t ruined. Also the shipping time is atrocious. By the time I ordered and then received the item, it was over two weeks. Also if you send in items to sell, you don’t get much in return. You are better off selling the items yourself on another platform or just donating the items. Also I am an active reseller, and thought I give thredUP a try and was very disappointed with the service. I will be moving on.",1
2269,"Love the Savings: I use the ThredUP app and love the ease of searching for and saving my favorites.  I use ThredUP to buy better brands to improve my wardrobe at a significant discount!  I have used a clean out bag and it is very easy.  However, I won’t do it again because I could actually get more from my clothes to donate them for a tax write off.  I only received a very small amount per accepted item.",5
2270,"Fantastic app: Clothes from this site are well inspected, fairly priced and shopping is like a treasure hunt!  You can hold an item in your cart for a limited time and decide.  Shipping is free over a certain amount and if you spend $150 in a month, you earn unlimited free shipping for a month. Payouts aren't great when you sell to them but I feel good about cleaning out things I don't wear.  5 stars.",5
2271,"A great service and easy to use app: I like using ThredUP. I get to wear nicer quality clothes without spending so much or having to sort through endless racks at thrift stores. The app allows lots of filters to be able to see only your sizes and many searches within that. The 4 stars are because the app does not allow the same purchase options as the website, like buy and bundle. That is frustrating.",4
2272,"Finally decided to stop selling on here: Do NOT sell here!!! Such a scam! New with tags, in style items not being listed, which leads me to believe they are sorting and taking what they want first and then posting the leftovers for bare bones profit for the seller (I know their site says low payout, but now it’s just absurd how much they profit and how little sellers get). I used to get way more on payouts, even with less items. The last bag I got way less (payout) for a lot more (new and brand name along with very lightly worn clothing). Just donate and take tax deduction or go local 
consignment. Greed has taken over this business from a seller’s perspective.",1
2273,Loosing my business.: I used to love thredUP until I tried selling to them. They don’t give you anything for your clothes. Now they started to charge for returns. When buying used clothes you have to try it on. Fit is never correct with clothes that have been worn. Not to mention that I can get designer clothes off the clearance rack cheaper than I can buy their new with tags. I love the selection that they have. However buying at my local consignment store is becoming a better value.,3
2274,"Reserve Feature Ruins Experience: How is it a good business practice to let people keep items, unpurchased, in their cart for 24 hours, then at the end of that time let them quickly remove and replace the same items back in their cart again? I excitedly found several items I want to purchase, but they have been in someone’s cart for a week, unsold, held on to. I won’t be buying from this company, why would I want to infinitely wait for items I would happily purchase to be let go of by some greedy person that isn’t buying and isn’t releasing these items? It’s a waste of time!",1
2275,"Like the changes!: I’ve been using thredUP for years and in the past couple years I think they suffered some growing pains, but I’m really impressed with all the updates I’ve seen recently! Prices are much better, clean out kits are available again and the app experience it’s definitely improved.",5
2276,"Frustrated: I’ve been a customer for a few years now. I have had issues in the past with wrong sized stuff sent, items not looking like the picture, etc. Final straw was today when I tried multiple times to place an order and no payment method would go through and the app freezes every time I try to contact customer support. I try to hit the sales because this company overcharges severely for the very used items they sell but the hassle just isn’t worth even doing that. I’ll stick to thrifting locally.",1
2277,"Recent changes: I noticed some changes recently and they make shopping on the app less enjoyable. I search a brand and the first two items that come up are that brand and then it expands to include other similar. This is very frustrating.

Also, when I search something, the number of items was posted on the top left. No longer do this. Also very frustrating.",3
2278,"Clothes not as described: The clothes are cute in the image but I was sent items that vaguely resemble the ones in the pictures, not the items as described in the listings. The clothing measurements are extremely spotty and I made the mistake of trusting the listings (ex. skirt received was brown instead of black, with different waist and length measurements from shown on the listing; dress had blue and yellow flowers when they appeared white in the picture). I’m extremely disappointed. Still two stars because I’ve gotten a couple of nice things",2
2279,"used to like them: When i first started rethrifting and buying from Thred Up it was great… The past 3 times Ive had issues with orders… 2 items with incorrect descriptions, 2 of the wrong items sent (not even my order)  and 2 sweaters that were at least two sizes too small. When i want to return there’s an “offer”.  if you click anything once you see jt, it says you accepted the offer to keep the item and get credit. Unfortunately, i’m done using this site.",2
2280,"Wardrobe I can afford: I LOVE Threads Up, the first order was such a deal that I just haven’t been able to stop. Times are hard for all of us and this is a great way to have nice clothes that make you feel good and you couldn’t afford Otherwise shipping is quick and the communication is so easy. I am a customer for life.

2281,"Donate your clothes someplace else and get a better deal: First, they charge you to ship your clothes, then you get almost nothing as a percentage of the sale, and if you want any of your clothes returned to you, you have to essentially re-purchase them, albeit at a discount. I have given so many clothes in excellent condition, and ThredUp has sold them at great prices.  I received less than 15% of the total of my sales. 

Had I donated these clothes to a charity, using the market value that thredUP sold them for, the tax benefit to me would have given so much more $$ in my pocket.",1
2282,"My new way to shop: I found this app by accident but I say it was meant to be. I’ve been conscious of my buying and knowing there’s an app for second hand clothes, has made my journey more easier. Prices are great and the delivery is quite fast. Wish to see more sustainable brands tho. Overall, totally recommend.",5
2283,DO NOT USE THIS APP: I’ve sent in 3 kits for processing and stuff is missing. The first kit went smooth so I sent two more boxes in and only 5 items got listed the rest of my stuff disappeared. I’ve contacted their chat and email and keep getting told that someone will look into it and then I’m ghosted and no response. They usually have chat and email as customer service options and have turned off chat now with no phone number to be found. Worst experience I’ve ever had I would have rather donated the clothes to be honest. DOWNLOAD AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK IF YOUR STUFF GOING MISSING.,1
2284,"Epic fail! Unethical even: I really wanted to love this site and business model, but I  have had a horrible experience with the clean out kit. 11+ weeks have gone by since I  sent in a large box of clothes and accessories so I  sent an email to request a status update. Not only did they ""lose track of"" what I sent in, to make up for it, they give me $35 of store credit....one pair of brand new shoes in the box was worth $100...not to mention the designer clothes I sent in. 

I'm very disappointed and felt cheated and scammed. I'm taking my business to posh mark next time.",1
2285,"My favorite stores for half the price: I love this app, I’m a person who loves lululemon and Athleta and Nike and etc. However those stores are very expensive so when I discovered this app I fell in love. They have Lululemon pants which are originally $118 and on this app it’s only around 19-45$ for lululemon leggings! This is a app I will use till the day I die. Love it so much go and try it!!!!!!!!",5
2286,My Go To: I absolutely love buying through you. The website is so easy to navigate. I appreciate the filtering system and the descriptions of the items are always very accurate. I love being able to purchase unique and high quality items for great prices. And finally this is so good for the environment!,5
2287,Love it but they could improve...: I love thredUP. But I think the sizing could be done better-- I'm a plus sized person and I think they have some great options but sometimes the sizing is off/not descriptive enough. Sometimes the pictures don't show the designs well but all that to be said I'd buy from thredUP over fast fashion. ❤️,5
2288,"Poor or nonexistent customer service: I love thrifting! I love the concept and the savings. However, if anything goes wrong, there isn’t anyone to talk to. If you redeem points and anything goes wrong with the transaction, your points are gone forever. Additionally, although the policy is that if an item arrives other than described it is returnable for free (no restocking fee), that doesn’t hold true. Example: “like new” condition arrived with a giant stain but I paid a restocking fee, even though I filled out the correct form answers.",2
2289,"My new shopping addiction, with less guilt: The Thred up app is easy to navigate. You can find exactly what you are searching for using the multiple category options to fine tune your searches. One area that needs improvement are the photos of black colored garments. These photos need to be made clearer so that details like garment texture, pockets, buttons and zippers can be seen. Also , is it really necessary to charge such high restocking fees on returns?",3
2290,"Easy access: I love how simple thread up has made second hand shopping, only, I will it offered better pricing on these items so they’d be readily available to more individuals that need them, other than catering towards those that can afford to pay similar pricing that’s found with fast fashion etc.",5
2291,"The app has glitches: I love thred up. Unfortunately, there are 2 really annoying glitches in the app. The first is that when you “sort by newest,” it doesn’t actually. Only half of the results are “new.” 
The second is that it’s impossible to make a return.
I’m like a walking advertisement for thred up because I love it so much. However, these glitches (particularly the latter) bring me to a two star review. App developers, please fix these glitches, and I’ll be more than happy to give 5 stars!",2
2292,"Too many clitches: App freezes.  But timers for items in cart keeps ticking away regardless.  When items fall out if your cart, immediately become unavailable in someone else’s cart but their cart has no timer or has done ridiculous time of 167 hours.  Almost impossible to contact customer service.  Have to go thru barrage of questions and various options and type and retype problem before you get into a chat room.  Then usual solution is “redownload the app”.  It’s a mess with little or no customer service.  Go elsewhere",1
2293,"Great idea, could improve: I binge with this app and it’s a great idea-an online thrift store. They also have some excellent sales from time to time. 
Areas to improve:
More description-  is the fabric textured, rough, smooth, slinky, silky? If the brand and style is known, please add to the description. For example; Effie’s Heart-Napoli dress, or LuLaRoe - Morgan T
The prices on some items are great, on others surprisingly more than the sale price in store.",4
2294,Returns: Tried several times to make a return through the app. Spoke with the chat support several times and wasn’t able to get anywhere. Finally they emailed me and said it should work and still issues. Instead of the company just offering to send me a label they said well try a browser on a computer. What’s the point of having a app if you can’t use it?! Then I find out this “free return” they advertise everywhere is really just a return for a credit not your money back. Cool concept but really? Wont be shopping again.,1
2295,Lost Returns- No Customer Service Response: I sent two returns back to Thred Up with their label for credit and the returns never made it back and I lost close to $100.  I reached out to customer service several times and could never reach anyone.   I’ve spent more on this app than I’d like to admit and have received a lot of great items..  Just so disappointing …. I really did enjoy shopping here.,4
2296,"Amazing: Love this company, I’ve ordered from here 5 times and the item were perfect! The only thing I would criticize is the photos on the app, sometimes with black items (which is most of my items) are very well lit so you can’t see all the details. I ordered a kimono I thought was just black but it was actually black and brown paisley design. I love it it’s super pretty but just a surprise.",4
2297,"Love you mean it 💚: I love thredUp!! Any time I need a specific item of clothing it’s really easy to sort and filter by color, brand, and other identifiers!! I also go to thredUp for athletic clothes, shoes, dresses, and work clothes! I highly highly recommend them and love send my own gently or never worn clothes to sell myself, they make the process so easy and rewarding.",5
2298,Katheryn J Dixon Bardo: I really love it and the stuff you get is just as they describe it for the most part it’s been wonderful I think they can improve their search engine a little bit can be confusing until you get the hang of their system which is a little difficult other than that wonderful,5
2299,"♻️♻️♻️♻️: Wow words aren’t enough to express how thankful I am thred up exists. I have found so many amazing outfits, all secondhand. I love a good deal and thredUP is always having specials. I also have two baby boys and have found clothing for great prices for them as well. Now all thred up needs is a men’s section and I won’t have to shop anywhere else!",5
2300,Love this company!: I have been addicted since I downloaded the app. Everything I have received has been in the condition as described or better. I’m always pleased when I open my packages. Love that there’s an easy way to clean out my closet and an option to donate to a charity... the prices and sales are fantastic. Can’t say enough good things!,5
2301,Love it but....: I love the convenience of ordering my clothes online at a cheap price. A lot of the tops I’ve ordered for myself and my boys have fit but the problem I’m having is the skirts. I have ordered several skirts only to find out when I receive them that they have splits in them. Nowhere in the description does it mention splits. It would be a lot convenient if the ones that has splits would mention they do. But overall this is a great app and I love buying my clothes from them.,3
2302,"These people are crooks and should be shut down.: If you like the experience of sending perfect name brand clothes in bulk, some even with tags, waiting 4 months for them to even acknowledge they received it, and then getting a payout of $6.19 a week later cos you stuff sold so fast and for top dollar, this is the App for you.  Next time I have a perfect Prada jacket,  White House black market ensembles barely worn, banana republic work suits, Hudson jeans, and Tory Burch dresses with tags, I’ll actually donate them to a real 501(c)3 because these guys are not in this for charity or even the appearance of an equitable exchange.",1
2303,"Great but somewhat tries to trick you with “estimated retail price”: I love this app and I love the clothes I can find that are cheap, but some are said to be $100 dollars at retail price and they charge $50, but if you look up the designer or the type of clothing the price would be around the $50 price range. Just something to be aware of. Also it would be great if they allowed you to sort from “old to new” or “new to old”. Still love this app though.",4
2304,"Quality: I am a new customer who is extremely satisfied with the quality of purchases and their service.  They were so patient with me in helping me with their customer service communication  via email. I learn something new and it works.  The customer service professionals are awesome.  Their packaging is so unique- that separated them from other Online Providers! Good job!   WG, Texas",5
2305,"Great app for purchases: I've had a great experience and have gotten amazing items dirt cheap on ThredUP! I've even told my co-workers about the app and they are now raving praises too. Now, keep in mind, we all have only used it for purchases- no returns and no sales. It seems that reading through many of the reviews- that's where the problems lie. Personally, I LOVE the app and won't ever quit using it!!!",5
2306,"ThredUp Changed My Life: Saving hours and hours of sorting through clothing at stores, the ThredUp app is designed to truly specify what you are searching for, and your sizes.
You have ALL clothing brands at your fingertips - your faves and many that you have never seen.
Not only has ThredUp helped me to save time and get a more select wardrobe for a reasonable price, it has really increased my knowledge of garments.
THANK YOU!",5
2307,"Love!!: This app makes it so easy for me to shop for clothing. It has good descriptions of the clothing condition which gives me more confidence when buying. It’s also easy to sort and filter, which gives me and easier time to shop. I also like that when you have something in your cart it puts the item on hold for you for so many hours.",5
2308,"Do Not Sell: Do not sell your clothes expecting to make anything more than pennies... literally. Some items I got less than a dollar for. I also could have sworn the percentage I made from one pair of shoes that I sold went down. This site is terrible for selling clothes unless you would just like to donate them. I got excellent deals buying clothes from this site, that’s why it has three stars. I can’t complain about the purchases, but to sell clothes on here? You should pass.",3
2309,"BEST APP EVER!!: So I found the site one day from a Facebook ad and it’s the best thing ever and the fact that they have this cute app is great, now going to your local thrift store while it is fun they never have such cute options as ThredUp. Let me tell you about the DEALS girl it’s so cheap you can buy yourself a bunch of cute outfits and still treat yourself to a fancy dinner you can’t turn down these deals",5
2310,"Such a great app & way of shopping!: Can’t say enough about how amazing this app is. Being tall, it’s becoming more difficult to shop in stores. I love that I can search for tall clothing, it saves me so much time and money. Reducing pollution via reducing manufacturing new clothes + great selection + great tech + I only see sizes that I select + not paying retail prices = wonderful way to shop & build my wardrobe.",5
2311,Best shopping experience: I love the fact that ThredUp uses plus size mannequins so that you can see how the items look on a plus size woman. I also REALLY appreciate that they lost the actual width and length. So far everything I’ve received has fit perfectly and is holding up well. The website sometimes has glitches but....it’s still worth it.,5
2312,"Eco-friendlier shopping: If you aspire to vintage/consignment b/c it's more sustainable, this is a great app. I've been able to flesh out my wardrobe (and my daughters) quite well in a cost effective way. I really like the ""favorite"" feature - you can see your favorite items in a list, and decide if you want to purchase later. The items ship quickly in a cute box and are wrapped in sweet polka dot tissue paper.",5
2313,Customer service: I’ve had a hard time to simply change my email. You can’t change it in the app or online. I’ve contacted support several times asking them to update my contact information with no response or no follow-up. I just tried to return items and the shipping label was sent to an email that no longer exists because no one has gotten back to me about my original need to change my contact information. It’s frustrating and seems really dumb to not be able to be able to change your email on your own in the app or online. 😡,1
2314,Mixed feelings 😩: Love the shopping portion of the app. Great pricing and seamless purchase and shipping. and the quality of the items are pretty good for second hand. However I had a very underwhelming experience with the consignment side. Sent a great clean out bag and the “upfront” consignment fees were pitiful. I regret sending the bag so much I actually purchased some of my items back! And to add insult to injury Items I reclaimed which were subject to additional fees were never returned. Definitely took an L but copped some cute items too.,3
2315,"Secondhand Shopaholic: Since finding out about thredUP, just a month ago, my world has been rocked! It’s the first thing I check every morning and love scrolling through all the new listings and fabulous deals. I have gotten so many new with tag items for a fraction of the original price.  I have hit the fashion goldmine shopping secondhand which I never through was possible!",5
2316,"Very pleased!!: I am ""very pleased"" so far however, I am not a seller & feel for those who have had issues.  As a buyer, I'm thrilled & I too love flash sales, free shipping & good discounts on items already on sale.  Unfortunately for me, I have to check all the time (don't want to miss anything) & if I see a deal I'm elated & of course...I spend!!  I love this site it’s not my only one but becoming my favorite!!",5
2317,"Can’t get enough: I love this app! I’ve always been a fan of thrift shopping, but sometimes it’s hard to find exactly what you’re looking for. This app helps you narrow down searches and has a TON of options! Plus, their commitment to sustainability is wonderful and makes me want to support them even more.",5
2318,Maybe not the best: I downloaded the app wanting to buy male clothes i open the app sign in and everything then come to find out they dont have any men items only boys and female items also you would be better off going to a goodwill or an thrift store in person (stop being lazy) the items are good prices but when you get to the checkout the shipping it $10+ then they also tax you an extra 1-3$ so if your item was $8 it’s now $21 and some change you would be better going to another site and buying it brand new,1
2319,This “company” is a SCAM: Please do not send your good clothes to this place. They will tell you that your clothes with tags did not passed the inspection and will be donated. On top of that if you request an item return bag they will send you items that are not yours. They will price the items and your pay out for every $20 will me $1.90 so in my opinion if your closet has good quality clothes give them away or try to create a budget and invest your money in something that will give you an investment back. But not to this place they will steal from you.,1
2320,My whole family’s go-to: I absolutely love ThredUP! I cleaned out my closet and had several of those items post for consignment. My kids and I always think of looking at ThredUP first for all our needs. I can’t stand the thought of paying top prices for brand new anymore. The clothing I get from ThredUP is always in great condition.,5
2321,"I’m a fan!: I love what ThredUp has done for my closet! From cleaning it out to adding some super new pieces at such great prices! 
My only problems with the app are the Item Description is sorely lacking information and I haven’t found a way to get clarification on things that interest me; also, I really need the selling time to be at least a week longer.
Either way, I love shopping here!",4
2322,"Loved it until the  new $3.99 return fee: As a petite person, I’ve had great luck on ThredUp and buy so frequently that I have VIP status. However, since the return fees were increased to $3.99 PER ITEM I am having second thought. Last time 3 out of 4 items didn’t fit and it cost $12 to return. The return fees are making me less likely to purchase a variety of items.",4
2323,"Love, But: I love this zero-waste, waste reduction company. I’ve only had a problem a couple times when the clothes smelled like moth balls or something was worn out and gross but not listed as such. Also, I’ve tried selling a few times and they haven’t taken my stuff that’s in better condition than some items pictured.",5
2324,"Not cool: Was supposed to receive a clean out bag months and months ago. It never came. They cleared out the unresolved open request from my account and now are refusing to send any more bags to anyone (even though this request was made when they were sending bags and so isn’t a new request). I don’t want the label that I’ll have to go and buy a box for, thanks, that’s defeating the point of using the app. Customer service wasn’t helpful and told me to go to another app. Also the fraction of the money you get for them selling your clothes is silly.",1
2325,Make it even better: I love shopping thred up!! I have found wonderful items and have kept nearly everything I have purchased. I wish when you find an item you like it would show you items that are similar. That would make it that much better!,5
2326,Great app and great finds!: Some of my favorite pieces of clothing came from ThreadUP! The app makes it easy to shop specific brands and filter results. I love the ability to look at the clothing from the front and behind quickly without needing to click on one item of clothing. It is a very well designed app with lots of amazing finds!,5
2327,"Love ThredUp and helping the planet!: Two years ago, I committed to buying nothing new and I’ll never go back! ThredUp is my main source for all of my fave highend brands (also love my local consignment) but would be lost without this app! So nice to make back some money selling clothes too. Especially love the partnerships they do, like Rent the Runway! So many amazing brands.",5
2328,Not so sure it I like this or not: I like the variety and that you can save on shipping but it  takes a long time to get your order and tracking your order is impossible and then my order was split up so you have no clue what’s coming in each shipment if you can track it .,5
2329,Great Glad I made the choice to finally give it a try: Seen on TV and the internet and thought I will try it great prices and very good description of the quality of the clothes you purchase . I have been pleased with all my ORDERS. Will be sending some of our clothes in that are name brand and In good condition for a store credit.,5
2330,"Love the app, but searching could be better: I like the app and the idea of ThredUP, but some other apps have much better search functions. For example, I would like to be able to look at bottoms with pockets or dresses with pockets, but that is not an option. If you just try and use the search bar nothing comes up unless you are looking for a brand.",4
2331,"ThredUP is enjoyable? :D: My friend introduced me to ThredUP a year or so ago. I started using it and haven’t stopped! They have so many adorable articles, great prices and even better return policy! If I don’t absolutely love what I get I can return it super easily and get my money back. I will certainly continue shopping with ThredUP and share it with my friends!",5
2332,"Great site: Great site and wonderfully easy to use. Love the convenience and organization of the entire enterprise. Such a fun and easy way to find lovely clothes. 
The only criticism I would have is that estimated arrival dates when you track packages seem to always be overly optimistic. Always seems to take 3-4 more days than expected.",5
2333,"ThredUP: I just love this store/app. They have so many amazing and wonderful things at such a good price. U can’t beat some of these prices especially for new name brand items. I have brought so much stuff from this app and will continue to buy from here.
I have told many people about it and I love that everything is basically one of a kind.
Just love love this app/store🥰🥰🥰👍🏼💰",5
2334,Changed my COVID shopping !: Best option in so many ways. Discovered in my January closet purge to minimize and am now an avid shopper with it being my go-to online clothing store.  I check here first.  Feels good to upcycle and still stay in the minimize mindset of not over-indulging or spending. Ok maybe I’ve over ordered a couple times but it still cost me far less than traditional online or B&M.,5
2335,"Sustainable fashion but slow processing: I really do like this company for the sustainable reasons , I prefer clothes getting a second life rather than ending up in landfills and I like that any items they don’t accept ( if you don’t want them back offcourse) get recycled . But geez I have been waiting over four months for one of my bags to be processed and about 2 for another . I hope they are not lost the one bag had really expensive items in I was hoping to make some cash off .",3
2336,"Fun to shop: I love the convenience of bargain hunting online. You do need to be very intentional about your shopping - I received an item labeled as being a UK 38 which was actually a Chinese 38. Not at all the same thing. I’ve also received a shirt missing a button, which wasn’t in the description, and another one with a soiled sleeve. Otherwise it’s great to rebuild my wardrobe after significant weight loss with more coming off. Cheap and convenient!",4
2337,New go-to: The app is easy to use. I have ordered several times now and have been very satisfied with my purchases. All clothing I have received has been in great condition and has allowed me to rework my wardrobe in an enjoyable way! I love thrift shopping. Was hesitant about doing it online but have no regrets and am now completely hooked.,5
2338,Absolutely Love!: I haven’t had a bad experience ever. I’ve been using the app for about 4 or 5 years. I always get what is described and they give decent payouts. It’s so worth it to just chunk the old wardrobe out of your life. I know my “old” clothes will be used and this helps the environment! I literally sent the link to a few friends this week! Shop second hand! Shop ThredUP!,5
2339,"Sell your items YOURSELF!: Unless you are willing to accept 10% of the selling price for your unwanted clothes, sell your items yourself on other platforms. Yes this site does all the work for you, but unlike The Real Real where you actually make decent money this app gives you pennies. Once my items were finally processed I received an estimate of over $400 if all my items sold. Unfortunately this was the total — not my take. If all my items sell, I will earn $40!! It’s ridiculous & I can’t see this app surviving once people realize how much they are getting ripped off. NEVER AGAIN!!",1
2340,Great Selection: I hadn’t thought about how reusing textile is a form of recycling and helps the planet as a whole. Very cool!! I have sent clothing into Thred Up and purchased from them. Everything has been great. We also love the Goody Bag feature. I did this with my 11 year old daughter and she selected some pieces for her own wardrobe. It was fun to get that big box of clothes to sort through and try on.,5
2341,"Great app: Pros: 
Lots of items 

Cons:
Items sometimes in condition other than advertised 
Bad photos 

I have recently received a gift card but have no idea how to redeem it or use as a payment method. I’ve emailed them to get information. It’s frustrating that they offer gift cards - final sale, non-refundable - and there is no obvious way to actually use them. I’m hoping that I will get resolution soon but if not, the person who gifted this to me just gave ThredUP $100 for nothing. 
Other than this, I enjoy using the app. It’s very user friendly - no complaints. I find the clothes to be high quality and as advertised 90% of the time. The other 10% have needed only minor fixes or dry cleaning. 
That being said, I mainly buy shoes and handbags because there is less risk of having fit issues.",3
2342,"Upset! Reward program gone!: I used to love ThredUP then they started charging tax which I know is required with most sites now but they also charge additional fees that make everything much more and then they raise the prices on the clothes. I started to not want to shop with ThredUP until they started the reward program but with a recent update, the reward program is gone! Why? Ugh. Just when I start to want to give ThredUP another try, I get disappointed once again!",3
2343,LITERALLY AMAZING: I have ordered from this app 2 pares of jeans and a few shirt and I might even order my homecoming dress from here! Everything is always great quality and very stylish! You can have the feeling of thrifting and digging through clothing to find the hidden gems while sitting on your phone at your house! I definitely recommend this app/website to anyone who likes a bargain!!,5
2344,"Wonderfully convenient: I would give 5 stars but there are a few things this app doesn't do:
  * doesn't show the wear when listed as having it 
  * doesn't show plus size clothing on thicker maniquin 
  * doesn't assist in sizing...a few times I bought XL pants and there is no way they were normal American xl sized...maybe petite or kids...couldn't get past my thigh.

Other than those 3 things...I LOVE this app/company! I love that the clothes come in a bag that can be used to return product (genius!).
I love that you can send them your own clothes! I love the organization and ease of the app.
Nice way to thrift (I rarely buy new clothes or shoes...only undergarnents are always new) and I can do it from home...with 1/2 effort because it's all organized! ❤️",4
2345,"Great app great company: A couple improvements I'd like to see: more waist size options to filter by, the option to filter by chest size and shirt length the option to filter by pant length, and better ""you might also like"" fits to the item I'm on. Otherwise it's pretty easy to shop. But as a plus size girl I'd waste a lot less time looking through clothes that are too short or narrow if there were more measurement filtering capabilities.",4
2346,Absolutely Wonderful!: You will fall in love with this website. Not only do you get 40% off on your first purchase but you get access to new clothes up to 90% off! On my first purchase I was able to get 20 dresses and 5 skirts for under $140 that is a steal. Mind me that I’m in my early 20’s and wasn’t searching for ball gowns. But still everything I got was very pretty and suited my style.,5
2347,Not impressed. Hoped for more: Selection is not very desirable. Also the clothes are outrageously priced for what they are. Especially since the app hasn’t really established itself to be reputable. It seems people have been having ship time and customer service issues ON TOP of the strangely high prices . I say build a name first and then slowly increase prices on cuter or designer items but this is literally a glorified goodwill but 3 times more money. I will go search my local goodwill instead. I’m sure the app will evolve over time and improve. Best of luck to all.,2
2348,"Getting worse not better: This used to be a favorite of mine but it has gone downhill in the last 6 months. Obviously they are not staffed or organized adequately. 
Their response to questions and concerns takes well over a week. When you have a concern they do not respond to it but send a form message that has little or nothing to do with your question. 
Their descriptions of clothing, materials and measurements have gotten worse as time goes on. They give you less information to help in making your decision. 
The lack of info on some items makes it unusable.",1
2349,Love this Site!: Just found ThredUP recently and ordered a pair of high-end designer jeans I wouldn’t have purchased new to give the site a try.  They came in a cute package — were in fantastic condition and fit like a dream.  I’ve already placed my second order with them and can’t wait to get it!  I highly recommend. They’ve got today’s trends in fantastic brands and sizes to choose from.,5
2350,Great experience: I enjoy passing time finding cute outfits for myself & my daughter who is 5. Each season we are looking for the next size & I love scoring gently loved items in popular kids brands & styles. ThredUp costumer service is quick to answer questions or help with any question not answered easily in the Q&A. Highly recommend!,5
2351,"Beware! Don’t Send Them Your Clothes to Resell: This company is great to buy from but do not send them your clothing!  I filled a whole bag of clothes in the clean up kit, and paid extra to have them return unsellable items. I had NWOT items in there like Kate Spade and Anthro. It’s been almost a year and I have $0 store credit with them. Evidently the items didn’t sell. I feel like it’s a scam and I should’ve just donated my clothes to Goodwill rather than waste my time bagging. And obviously if I wanted to make money, I should the clothes at a local reseller/consignment shop.",1
2352,"Great idea, not always great prices on designer items: Love the app and idea of the thriftiness. But, check prices on designer items. Christian Loubouton bags are often listed for darn near retail prices. Also check who the seller is, The Real Real sells with ThredUP and you can find the bag listed on their site cheaper. Just shop around before you buy. 👍🏻",5
2353,"Super Convenient: Thrifting is my jam for so many reasons. It’s good for the planet, my wallet, and I get a thrill out of finding treasures. This app makes it so easy to search, using the filters, for exactly what I want whenever I have a few minutes of down time. If you are a ThredUp user or a thrifter who’s never thrifted online, this app is a must!!",5
2354,Really cool: I can’t believe the cool finds and the variety for petite women!  If I find things I love I check here first! There are almost no thrift stores near my town and while they have men’s clothing there are dirty clothes that are in style. I sell high end fashion and the payout is better than other luxury clothing payouts. I have made $700 at this site  in 2 months!,5
2355,I Love My Style: Over the years I’ve continued to get clothes from Thred Up. Almost all of my clothes now come from this App. I get compliments all the time on my expensive looking style and it’s even better because I know I didn’t spend a fortune- I love shopping thrifty. Looking and feeling like a million while staying on budget.,5
2356,"Terrible for sellers: I used to love this website. But i would typically get less than a dollar as a payout on each item. Now with the company deducting $11 from each person’s payout now, that would be all of it for me. I will never sell on this site again. The company is gonna lose inventory fast",5
2357,"Good if you know what you are looking for, BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU BUY ON FINAL SALE: I have ordered a few things off Thread Up over the last few months. I started going back to the gym and didn’t want to pay retail prices for workout clothes. Be careful about what you buy though. They sent me a child’s  XL that was marked on the website as an adult XL. Still trying to contact their elusive customer service but since it’s final sale I doubt I have high chances to get a refund. Maybe they will get back to me eventually.",2
2358,"Clothing great, website glitches, personnel iffy: Customer support, Jose, snarky, know it all, impatient and rude- even yelled at me. I also excused myself from conversation with ‘enjoy your day’ and I still receive ‘are you still there?’

Clothes are always as advertised and I am never disappointed. Website has glitches at times.",5
2359,"Need to be able to choose multiple filters: I buy (and sell) a lot through this app. It works pretty well but I get frustrated that i cannot choose multiple filters (eg i can look at tops OR dresses, but not both; I can only look at one category at a time.) Otherwise it's a good app, and buying used clothes is the right thing to do for my wallet and the planet.",4
2360,"Big Fan!: When I go to the mall, I completely freeze overwhelmed by options and crunched for time. ThredUp has clothes from all of my favorite stores and brands without the stress. Compared to other used clothing sites, it insanely user friendly. I just ordered my second bundle and anticipate restocking seasonally for me and my kids.",5
2361,"High end fashion for hundreds less: Every time I buy clothes on ThredUP it’s when they’re having a sale. I always get incredible designer clothes for the cost of a single designer shirt from a store. I just got 5 tops, 2 pair of pants and beautiful shoes for barely $80. Almost everything still had tags on it. This website is amazing!!",5
2362,"Affordable and Beautiful Finds: I love being able to find great clothes that are ready for a second life. Most of my wardrobe has come from shopping here and it feels so good to champion this sustainable business. 

Why 4/5 stars? There’s some work to be done on the search and filtering:
+ More material options (this is shown on product pages, why not search filters?)
+ Keep material search for specialty sizing (my kingdom to search for petite linen pants!)   
+ Search by garment measurements in addition to conventional sizing (which is ridiculous and subjective). Know this would be a big undertaking, but I’d probably purchase more and return less if I was more confident in the actual size of the product.",4
2363,"Top Notch: I love Thred Up, always has great deals and the shipping time is fast.  I felt bad because a rating request popped up and I accidentally hit I wasn’t enjoying Thred Up, and I couldn’t go back to correct it, so wanted to leave a good rating here!  I definitely enjoy it and look forward to buying more new to me pieces in the future.",5
2364,"Searching for items could improve: The app is close to perfect. I wish there was a simpler way to search for non brand specific items. For example I search “snow boots” and the search pulls up brands that have those key words regardless of category. Also sometimes children’s and teen clothing gets mixed into a search for women’s.
Like I said it’s still a very useful app but the search and tagging aspect could be tightened up.",3
2365,"Poor customer service and long delays: I have been using this app for almost a year now. I really liked their concept of buying second hand and reducing waste. However, their customer service is terrible. I shipped my clean out bag 9 months ago and it still hasn’t been processed. When I contacted the customer service through the live chat on the app, no one even responded to my inquiry. Besides selling, orders can also be delayed and arrived much later than you have hoped.",2
2366,This is where I get all my clothes now!: Half my closet is filled with ThredUP finds. As a pre-service teacher I was on the hunt for some appropriate professional wear and there is so much to be found on here! Can’t recommend them enough. And getting clothes second hand is the most sustainable thing you could possibly do!,5
2367,Best clothing app ever.: I love shopping here and I am always excited when I order something new! They’re boxes and bundles are great and love finding new brands that I would never see in stores. It’s also a great way to get a little shopping credit by going through your closet. 100% recommend shopping here if you love to thrift!,5
2368,"ThreadUp: i know you say you’re return policy is so easy but honestly i’ve been trying all afternoon to get ahold of some one about returning something for credit but no one has gotten back to me.
i love your company and believe inClimate Change and our Earth.  i will be a steady customer but please spell out Returning clothing WITHOUT A RETURN LABEL.  
There wasn’t one in my box. please find my messages and contact me asap.
J. Cirillo",4
2369,"Addictive!: I check this app nearly daily! Ok, maybe not that often but often enough. Love it, easy purchase, pics & descriptions relatively representative (although would love to see a pic of inside of coats and soles of shoes!) of items, easy returns as well of need. Makes me feel like my wardrobe is no longer static but ever changing.",5
2370,"Too long for items to get posted: I’ve sent several bags to sell but it takes a really long time for the items to get posted. Most recently, it’s been almost 2 months since my bag was scanned and the items still have not been processed and posted on the site.",5
2371,"Love it!: This site is great! I’ve made a few purchases and have been satisfied. I love recycling and it is so easy to find like new items at a reasonable price. Can’t beat it!

One thing That would be extremely helpful to me would be to add a filter for chest size. I am sm-xs but have a large bust. It’s time consuming to sort through every item, and open each one to check the chest measurements.

Otherwise, I think I’m addicted 😛",4
2372,"It’s good for our planet and your wallet: The least we as humans can do is try to reduce waste and recycle. That’s what this site is all about. Getting you products that are in style for a low cost!! I have yet to be disappointed by my purchases. Totally obsessed!! 

Some styles are a little out dated but if you are willing to search there are some total gems out there!!",5
2373,"❤️ Thred Up!!: I love, love, love shopping with Thred Up! As a school teacher, I always want to dress nicely for what my budget will allow. I get so much for my money with Thred Up—so much more for my money than I would at a mall or department store!! Plus, I get treasures I would never find otherwise & I feel like I’m doing my part to help our planet by recycling clothes!!❤️",5
2374,"Great system: No hassle, no stress selling items. You may not get top dollar value but the ease of packing a bag, mailing it off and letting someone else stage & photograph you items is worth it! I have been extremely happy with most of my purchases. I did initiate 2 returns for items that looked better in photographs than in person without any problem and promptly received back credit for my items.",4
2375,SLOW MAIL!!!: I ordered a bundle over two weeks ago and it still has not shipped.  When I contacted customer service they said- we are running behind with no estimate of when this would arrive.  No discount.  Nothing at all.  In this day and age it should NEVER take almost three weeks to receive an order.  And I haven’t even received it yet!,5
2376,"Wonderful App: Almost perfect! I ordered a few items and all of them were true to the measurements on a the app. :)

I really wish there was a way to exclude certain results from a search. For example, I like Athleta’s athletic pants, but I’m not interested in buying leggings (which make up most of the results). This is a minor issue, but I think an “exclude ___” option would be a helpful addition to the search software!",4
2377,"Love the clothes, hate the boxes!: I am so excited to start using thredup!  My first order came and everything was in great shape!  I love that this is an easy was to cut down on environmental waste and so many other benefits.  My only disappointment was that my order came in 4 different boxes!  What a waste!  I would have rather waited a longer time to receive everything all together in one shipment, cutting down on the cardboard waste.",4
2378,"Great for buying, not as much for selling: Yet I still send them things because they make it easy.

Love to reduce & reuse but there’s plenty of new things too. I can’t sift through a whole thrift store - I don’t have that patience. I love I can search my sizes and specific brands. I’ve had really great lately. Thanks What Not To Wear for teaching me some things about dressing my body! Thanks for measurements ThredUP!",5
2379,"Meh. Great concept: No muss no fuss. You can easily get rid of clothes and buy clothes. However the team they have reviewing needs help. As a buyer... Some items marked as “like new” were stained, and unreturnable. Other items were not listed correctly and required you to pay to return them. Lastly... as a seller they only take some seemingly random items. And there is a very small percentage that you actually get. I submitted brand new unworn designer shoes that they didn’t even list. Yet a very used dress they listed for far too much in my opinion.",2
2380,"Love this app!!: I absolutely love this app! I have been so pleased with the quality of clothes I have received, and am addicted to searching for new wardrobe pieces for great prices. Being able to input my sizes to search by is so helpful, and being able to filter certain brands is also a plus. I also love that you can send unused clothes in for free to receive credit.",5
2381,Unbelievable!: When I ordered my box I had no idea that they were not brand new until the next day when I decided to do a little more research. Some of the items were brand new with tags. I had been waiting to look at the price sheet because I LOVED all 17 items they sent! When I did look at the prices I was shocked!!! I am now a walking advertisement :),5
2382,"Great way to find second hand items: I’m a big fan of thrifting because I can not only get designer/more expensive items at affordable prices, but also helps since I’m doing my best to lower the waste from fast fashion. The app is very user friendly. I’ve gotten some nice bags which I love! My only issue is that the ‘notify me when available’ functionality does not work.. other than that I really like the app.",4
2383,Shady behavior: I feel like I’m being scammed by thredUP. I got one of their goody boxes and kept two items. I filled out their online return form and submitted what I was returning/ why. I filled out the form but there was no option to review before hitting submit. Somehow another shirt must have been selected because I got charged for three items. It is an extra $27 on top of what I was willing to spend for something I didn’t even keep. I’ve tried to email them twice since Thursday and I’ve had no response. How long does it take to get a response? I’m starting to to feel super wary about this business.,1
2384,"Somewhat Satisfied: I love the concept of Thred Up, mainly because it makes second hand clothing shopping super easy, and cuts down on waste in the garment industry. My only suggestion would be to advertise the Clean Out Kit, and Goody Box process in a more realistic manner. It takes way to long for both to be processed. If this is going to be the trend then it needs to be advertised to consumers as such.",5
2385,"Great for selling in my experience: I have sold with thred up recently and I am planning on doing it again. I’ve already ordered my second bag! Despite what other reviews are saying, I think Thred Up is very reliable rather than other second hand stores that you drive all the way to just to get rejected (never sell with Plato’s). I am very pleased with my Thred Up experience!",5
2386,"Love this!!!: I have been using this app for about two years now! If you love Thrifting, it’s definitely the most convenient way to thrift online! Extremely excellent prices! Very easy to sell your items and return items if you don’t like them! My items sell really well on thredUP as well!",5
2387,ThredUP is the best way to find what you want for less money!: My sister uses this and talk to me about it- she was right! I have found so many wonderful clothing items for 50 to 60% off or even higher. Everything has come really nicely packaged and clean and you can’t beat it!! I’m a customer for life!,5
2388,"Loving it!!!: I have a favorite jacket and had no idea how I could get another, and bingo!!!  I put it in the search and there it was, in a different color.  I was still hesitant to use app the first time, not sure about quality and timeliness, but I’m so glad I did and now I shop here first.  Amazing prices and it helps our planet.",5
2389,"It could be improved: I’ve been using this app for a very long time. I’ve seen the improvements but I still think it could be streamed lined and more user friendly. I also think the prices are too high, I’m sure that will always be the case. Thrifting use to be fun because you find good deals now it’s just shopping “regular” it would be nice to have better sales or lower shipping or something….. even occasionally to get that experience of “thrifting!”…. Everything eventually wants to make a PROFIT, I understand, it’s just a bummer.",1
2390,"Damaged items/Incorrect Descriptions: I have had so many issues with Thred Up orders including holes, rips, and items not as described. The last straw for me was when I tried to apply a five dollar credit to a sale item and the price went back to the normal price. I was told by customer support that it was an “either or” situation. Either the credit or the sale price. Then it’s not really on sale is it? Frustrating and not worth it with so many alternatives out there.",2
2391,"Great for buying not for selling: Thred Up is great for people buying clothes on a budget. I found some really nice clothes and accessories at decent prices. On the flip side, I sent Thred Up a box of clothes to sell. It took them almost 2 months to get to my box. One of the items was a brand new $60 pair of jeans. They sold them for $18. I am getting $2.11. 😳 I will continue to buy from them, but won’t sell anything through them again.",3
2392,Good for an occasional buy: Good brands at good prices. I bought a few things but had to pass on a lot because I couldn’t really see the quality or detail of the item in the pictures. Black clothing looks like a black void. It’s difficult to impossible to see any detail. Wear is stated as ‘possible’ but not actually photographed or described and you can not see the inside of purses or shoes. For these reason I’ll stick to PoshMark for now.,3
2393,"Great ideal & app in general: The whole entire shop is a great ideal, but let’s talk about inaccurate descriptions are a 50/50 chance of happening. I have ordered lots of items….When it comes to jeans they are usually 3 to 4 inches off from the measurements that are posted in the description. They tend to brush over and not mention marker spots or oil stains. Yes they refund eventually, but it gets old having to return stuff when you know that you got your side right, but their side was insanely inaccurate.",2
2394,"So disappointed: I’ve been shopping ThredUP for 4 years now. Loved the selection, prices and feeling good about reusing denim, leather and clothing. Unfortunately the company starting charging $15 to send them used clothing and increased the restocking fee per item on top of a flat return fee. I understand that costs are rising but I refuse to PAY a company to take my clothing and turn around and keep a fairly hefty percentage of the sales price. If it’s not a sustainable business then maybe it should rethink its model.",2
2395,"Thread Up Is the absolute BEST place to buy top quality clothing: I can’t say enough good things about Thread Up. Not only have I found the most amazing designer clothing but Thread Up makes it extremely easy to make returns if you need to return things for any reason. I was shocked by how quickly they processed my return.

I have also sold items on Thread Up and have been very happy with the payouts I’ve received.

I have to say that I’m extremely happy because I was able to refresh my wardrobe and save a lot of money and their return policy is so great that I only kept the items that I absolutely love. 

I highly recommend!!!",5
2396,"Horrible, use Poshmark instead: The Thred up app employs dark ux techniques and preys on addictive behavior. There's a lot of scummy little tactics in here to force you to spend more while not getting what you want. High free shipping, no free returns to credit card without paying return fees, restocking fees, extremely short shopping cart holds, intentional poor/glitchy search features. I truly hate shopping on Thred Up and experience nothing but stress every time. Will be permanently deleted after I spend my ""balance"" which cannot be transferred back to my credit card.",1
2397,I love Thredup: This my fav place to shop.  I could spend all day looking for bargains and in fact some days I do.  Thredup doesn’t always get it right but mostly they do and they r willing to fix the problem!  And I have to honestly say that they excel in handpicking only the best selection of garments!  I’ve never had a flawed garment.,5
2398,"Not really Impressed: Ordered 6 items , 2 were rated in good condition, the other 4 were rated in excellent condition. Received the package yesterday and upon inspection, 3 of the “excellent” items were in fair condition at best..sweaters that had tons of piling & loose threads galore. Not sure who is in charge of rating the clothing at Thred-up but I think it’s time they look for a new career! 
Not worth sending back as they charge restocking fees (Even if they’re at fault) Just be aware, you can’t always trust the rating that’s given.",2
2399,"Bad service: Super disappointed that I bought a pair of jeans with a zipper that was completely broken. When I sent it back because of the broken zipper, they would not issue a refund because of the broken zipper. It was broken when it arrived. It should have never been sold to me, especially as it was listed in excellent condition. And then customer service is never available for chat. That is a bad way to do business. It’s a good idea for an app. But I have zero faith in the company. And I want my $40 back. It honestly feels like they stole.",1
2400,"Easy search ability with one recommendation: I love how easy it is to search for specific brands, styles and conditions. You can search thousands of products with good quality for being thrift.  I just wish I could search for hoods or pockets! You can search for everything else!",5
2401,Great Way to Expand Your Closet on a Budget: They have an amazing selection of clothes at good prices! I’ve become so addicted with shopping on their site and found so many goodies. Only thing I wish they had to improve the app is a dark mode feature; it would make it a bit easier on the eyes.,5
2402,"Love ThredUp!!: I lost weight and had to replace my entire wardrobe.  So glad I found ThredUp, especially during the COVID  pandemic. I love it! You can buy as well as return things very easily, and I have discovered some new brands I don’t usually see locally. I have recommended this company to many people. I’m grateful to them for providing such a great service.",5
2403,"Worst customer service: I got one box and it was not good, so I sent it back and canceled my subscription. Three months later a box shows up to a house I no longer live in, in a state I no longer live in much less, and luckily my neighbors found it. But it was too late and I got charged more than $200 for clothes I never even saw. Once I got the box, I reached out to thread up several times and have still received no responses. The clothes are not a good fit for me, this is why I canceled, but I’m still having to deal with this crap.",1
2404,"Love the clothes- the App is a trick to spend more: They allow you to set filters to shop, and then regularly show you things outside your price range so that you spend more money than you’d like. Scrolling takes twice as long to get through the clothes because the RESHOW you more expensive items as you scroll even if you have your filters set to show you price high to low or vice-versa. I tried to contact customer service and just get kicked off the app as i hit submit... sadly disappointed",2
2405,"Used to spend $$$$ here - not any more: Once upon a time thredUP was amazing: great deals, and decent commissions on clothing I sold via their “Closet Cleanout.”

Then, just like Etsy and AirBnB, they got greedy. Prices went up up up and commissions went down down down. Then they stopped accepting closet cleanouts.

The final straw came when I discovered - much to my surprise - that thredUP has zero inventory control. You can order something, and if it doesn’t show up, they have no way to track where the missing item went. 

When this happened, I told customer service I didn’t want a refund - I wanted the (missing) shirt. But I didn’t have that option. Because if it doesn’t show up, as far as they’re concerned, it has vanished.

Imagine any other business acting like this!

So. Bye-bye threadUp! From now on I’m shopping exclusively at local thrift stores.",2
2406,"Lack of customer service: I used to be a big fan! It was a very convenient way of cleaning out the closets as well as donating. Sadly I would no longer recommend anyone use this service. You still have two bags of clothes that have never been sorted, sold, or donated. I am not the only one that has had this problem. I have heard from friends and family that they too have had the same issue and now refuse to use or recommend ThredUP. I have attempted to contact customer service on multiple occasions and have gotten zero response. If I could give zero stars I would.",1
2407,"Mostly a scam: Very little information provided for clothes. One photo of front and one of back—VERY limited measurements. Sizing varies across the same brand even sometimes nowadays, so when buying clothes online it’s helpful to have decent measurements. If something does not fit or you don’t like it, your money is virtually held hostage as store credit (minus a $1.99 restocking fee) unless you want to pay $9 for return shipping. App is also buggy on return dashboard. I love ThredUP as a concept but can’t help but feel that I’m set up to fail as a buyer.",2
2408,"Long Time User: I’ve been shopping with ThreadUp for a few years now. Sadly, the bigger they get, the worse it becomes. The measurements have lost their accuracy, the shipping process is so slow, it takes you a week to get a rush delivery, and the prices have SKYROCKETED. $20 for used Walmart Jeans?!? Uh, no thanks. And forget the boys section... I shouldn’t have to pay $1.99 to return an item when they miss measured the product. I am really hoping that this is a terribly long slump and I can return to avoiding stores (also for years, not “pandemic” related).",2
2409,"Looking great never felt so good!: I am obsessed, probably to an unhealthy level! I have gotten a lot of great quality clothes- and shoes!- from thredUP and I’m always looking for my next favorite. It is also really nice to know that I am not purchasing new and adding to the environmental waste that is fast fashion, while still being able to buy some of my favorite brands.",5
2410,"So many options and great prices!: ThredUP is a great alternative to shopping for new clothes online, especially if there are no good thrift stores in your area! 

I have found like new items of great quality for great prices! You can also send your clothes to sell there. The buyout is very very little but worth it so your unwanted clothes get a longer life!",5
2411,"Condition: I strongly advise shopping by condition and selecting “like new”. I have had a lot of luck getting many items this way. When I have shopped “gently used” I have been disappointed in the quality and the item is not always what the picture portrays it. Overall, ThredUP is a wonderful resource to cloth the family and I would recommend it.",5
2412,"Prices: Your prices can be outrageous for used clothing. I search for deals, or I would not buy, and why do you only give discounts to new customers, you don’t appreciate your loyal customers. I have been shopping with you for years and I can see the difference with prices of the clothes and how you treat loyal customers who come back, we don’t get appreciation. That needs to change, because you have competition, and give nice discounts. Think about.",3
2413,"Game Changer!: This app and website completely changed how I shop for clothes! I’m into sustainable fashion and thrifting but missed my favorite brands and trendy pieces. I also missed the convenience and familiarity of online shopping, but that all changed with Thred Up! The prices are low and the quality is high. Great service and the ability for refunds on many items.",5
2414,Best App Ever !!: I NEVER write reviews but this app deserves it. Literally the best app I’ve ever downloaded. I’ve ordered 10 things so far and it’s amazing how much you save AND what great condition the items are in. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! The best part about it too is that they do this to lessen clothes and accessories going to landfills so they’re also helping the environment. I’ve recommended it to like 8 of my friends and will keep recommending.,5
2415,"Good Concept, But Needs Work: I’ve been trying to only buy secondhand clothes this year, and am so grateful for apps that make it easier than ever to do this! That being said.. ThredUP needs some work.
The items on the app are organized by brand, which is nice, but there aren’t any good descriptors on the clothing items to make them easily searchable. I was hoping to buy some jeans from the app, but only certain styles of certain brands fit me. While I can sort by brand, there’s nothing in the items’ descriptions to indicate which style/fit of jean they are (something like: “Old Navy Rockstar Skinny Jean”).
 
The same goes for other items of clothing: if I want to find a denim shirt, what I actually have to search is “button down shirt,” and then sort through thousands of shirts...

ThredUP, I WANT to love you. Please improve the search-ability of your store!",2
2416,"Awesome: Honestly the payouts are reasonable considering I’m personally too lazy to take photos and promote through other selling apps it’s so much easier to just get a bag shipped and send everything I don’t want anymore that would have just been sitting in my closet. 

I do personally enjoy shopping for very specific items and it’s easier to look them up by brands.",5
2417,"Disappointing: I received, filled and returned a bag of clothes to sell on site. TBH, I don’t use these sites much but thought I’d check it out. 
They sold my clothing items for $91 (I looked them up). I received $4.61 that I could keep as a credit, transfer to my PayPal or put on ThredUp prepaid Visa. It appears the Visa is something like a store credit card for them - by opening it, you are seriously impacting your credit. That isn’t explained anywhere.
But the app has a good interface and i suppose $4.61 is better than nothing but the whole experience left me feeling taken advantage of. I won’t be back.",1
2418,"Great to shop at, terrible payouts.: I sent multiple good quality items in a clean out bag. About half were taken. The payout is literally like 0.60 cents for each item sold. And then they turn around and sell your item for $10. They make 95% profit. That part is unfair. You’re better off selling your nice clothes at a yard sale for $2 each.
Otherwise, I do love shopping with thredUP and do find some good bargains with them. Just will never use them for consignment any more.",3
2419,"Read this before you want to sell to them: First, it took a year to even get a bag from them. Every time I tried to order a clean out bag, it said that they were too busy to send one. That made me angry, but that’s not even the worst.
Second, they sent my mom a shirt that smelled like smoke and urine. I thought they were supposed to send high quality clothing?
What made me the most angry is that they have a listing for a shirt that I sent in, but they didn’t give me credit for it. That is the biggest scam. They are taking clothes and selling it without giving you the money they said they would.",1
2420,"Love the concept: I just recently placed my first order, then I thought what do o have to loose, simply tried it out. Ordering made easy, shipping came quickly, nicely packaged, made me feel like a special customer, the clothing is like brand new, top labels, and just my right sizes,plan on ordering again. Found a new place to shop with quality clothing, happy customer.",5
2421,So many compliments: I buy 90% of my clothes from thredup and I get complimented on the cool pieces I find all the time. I love the app interface it’s so much easier than any of the other consignment options. I also like that everything is photographed the exact same way and measurements are always included.,5
2422,"They really f’d the site and app up: Thredup did some updates a few months ago, and the website and app hasn’t been the same since. Viewing on the desktop site, the number of available items to me is half of what new customers are offered. The app does not show all of my saved items, even though I ask to be notified on an item. I’ll click on the notification and it just opens the app. The “upgrades” to the app should be reverted; when an item is in someone's cart the font is so tiny.",1
2423,"Thrilled with ThredUp: When Im shopping for clothing or accessories, ThredUp is my first stop. I always find great things at Amazing prices.I even shop for my kids. There is always a Big sale happening too. Living remotely with no real place to shop, ThredUp has been a Game Changer..especially in today’s economy. Plus Im recycling and not contributing to more waste! 

H.",5
2424,"Always The Right Find: Thred-up is my favorite app! I used to get frustrated looking through so many items, but not any more. Now I put in what I am looking for or put in a search and I find just what I am looking for. Be specific and you will have success! Example: Tan long sleeve cashmere sweater, and yeah, there it is.",5
2425,"Fun!: As long as you know your body type, and what looks good on you, you can score some really good deals! I check every week or two to see what’s new and I’ve gotten a pretty good looking wardrobe from Threadup. If I make a mistake I figure someone less fortunate than me can wear itand I haven’t given away my whole paycheck.",5
2426,"First stop shopping: I’ve been a Thred-Upper since 2013 and recommend it to all my friends.  Using the numerous filters, saving favorite searches, and zooming in on the item’s details make browsing ThredUp’s intense inventory manageable. I’m very happy to help detour good clothes and accessories away from the dump and into my closet, and to spend so much less on clothing.",5
2427,"It’s not the same anymore: I used to be a huge fan of TU. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars outfitting my son from age 2-7. He’s now 11 and I just spent 15 mins shopping on the app for him. Nothing! Most of the brands I’ve never heard of. I used to be able to find diesel jeans, adidas, polo, and other higher end clothes that made shopping here fun. This wasn’t fun and I’m disappointed because it’s not a go to ( for my son) anymore. 
Bring back 2017!!",3
2428,"Excited to be here!: I’m thrilled that my friend/coworker shared this site with me. She is always dressed to the nines and we both love high end fashion, but I’ve been in a lull when it comes to dressing up. To know I can dress my best while also helping in an industry that is highly revolving makes me happy. I can see lots of thredUPing in my future! Haha, love it!",5
2429,The best thrifting store/app out there!: I have never found such amazing pieces any other way! And it’s great for our planet. The best of both worlds. I find quality items that I honestly don’t think I could ever find shopping in stores for new items. It’s the first place I go when I want a certain look.,5
2430,"I love it! But take sizing with a grain of salt: I adore ThredUP and give them tons of my money. That said, I have found measurements to be off (they seem more like a suggestion sometimes). Also, they list a EU 38 as a US 8. It is not. It is a 7-7.5. A 39 is an 8-8.5. I have to mess with my size settings and sift through twice as many shoes because I need to look at both sizes to find my very standard women's size 8/39.",4
2431,"Horrible Experience: Ordered several items, none of those fit, sent back with their return label, has taken several weeks for account to be credited.  Bet I don’t do this again! The only reason I rated with 1 star is because a zero rating is not an option.",5
2432,"Good app, terrible shipment tracking: None of my 4 shipments have delivered within the original proposed window. They always change the tracking on the day that it is supposed to be delivered. They tease you with a package arrival date and then don’t deliver. Prices are decent and selection has been fine. Some items were not as pictured. I have had to return broken items or very poorly repaired items.",3
2433,"Love the app, but…..: Fix your search algorithm already!!! If I’m searching for, say, size 18 capris I should NOT be seeing size 12 or 14 full length jeans. Do you have any idea how aggravating it is to have to search through 300+ results to only find maaaaybe 15 or so that actually fix the inputted criteria?! It’s stupid and annoying, wastes my time, and makes me want to not use the app as much.",4
2434,"Needs some improvement: So I shopped at ThredUp a LOT until I started getting frustrated with some of the errors in their listings that were not returnable despite being their mistake, and it became no longer worth it. Some examples: 
- Several items listed as “like new” with missing buttons, stains or holes in them and not returnable
- A strapless dress listed as a “maxi skirt” that was not returnable
- A “dress” that had slits on the sides up to the waist and was therefore more of a long shirt (also not in the description or photos and not returnable)
- Items smelling bad and not returnable 
- An entire box getting lost in the mail and them claiming not being responsible for any credit or refund
After this I stopped shopping with them.
If they were more flexible with returns when it’s a mistake with their listings I may reconsider.",2
2435,"UI is amazing: User interface is amazing. This app is so easy to use, easy to sort items (I wouldn’t mind a few extra sort option, but no real criticism). 
Shopping online is basically the option I have nowadays so I appreciate the photos, descriptions of the clothing, and availability of discount/promo codes.",5
2436,"So far so good: I’ve been thru the ordering process. I found so many high quality Tahari dresses, skirts, shoes for a fraction of what they would cost in the store. I love Tahari. And Threds up lists measurements so it’s easy to decide if the dress will fit. Plus you can complete a filter so dresses and other items are more suited to your particular size!! Fingers are crossed.",5
2437,"Beware: Addictive: I love to shop thrift -I get my clothing second hand almost exclusively. I believe in acquiring items second hand whenever possible, to help eliminate waste. It’s just a small, easy thing to do for the environment.  

With that being said... oh Thred Up, you have made it way too easy and convenient for me to go clothes shopping. I can easily spend $100 a month on this app. 

But I love it, I have acquired so many adorable and unique items! I also love the excellent search features, buy & bundle feature is great, easy returns and great rewards program!

You guys do an amazing job and it’s truly an awesome idea!",5
2438,"Reduce, reuse, recycle: I love thread up - I’ve scored some incredible deals on new and nearly new clothes and shoes that I just love.  It’s great to be able to send in items and get credits or cash when they sell too - and what doesn’t sell they can donate, so there’s no waste.  It’s kind of like guilt free shopping.  And the app makes it so easy to find the best of the best - tailored to your sizes and preferences.",5
2439,"Pretty user friendly, could be less expensive: I love this app, but you won’t find deals like at a thrift store. There are also some components of the app that could use updates, like swiping to go to the previous page and a more user-friendly zooming feature on pictures. Overall I’m happy with it, but still looking for better deals on similar items on Poshmark.",4
2440,Love love love!: Thred Up is absolutely my favorite thing of 2020. Because of COVID I can’t scour the thrift and resale stores like I normally do. I believe in buying second hand whenever possible - better for the environment and better for all. I have found Thred Up to be great at getting back to me with questions and fair with returns. Absolutely thrilled with the company and our new used clothes.,5
2441,"Obsessed: It’s a true addiction. Designer brands grossly discounted and then the option to pay for them over time. I have gotten all of my kids back to school clothes, winter gear and athletic leisure items here. Shoes are awesome. Returns are so easy. Selling your clothes is easy. Other than spending way too much money :). I’m obsessed and tell everyone. Thanks for making resale so easy!",5
2442,Love it!!!: What a great shopping experience this app offers. I have been able to get everything from jeans for me and baby clothes for my little girl. Keeps us within budget and I love the option of being able to send in clothes that I no longer wear and get money for towards new items!!  What a wonderful and genius concept!,5
2443,"Help.: So the site is ok. But the worst part is that if there is a problem. There is no one to contact by phone or chat to get things straightened out.  I returned an item, during COVID.  Needed to be returned before July 10.  No one to call and July 10 is here.  I don’t want to lose my credit due.  You know the song.  “Who ya gonna call?”   NO ONE TO CALL. THUMBS DOWN.",5
2444,"Great place for second hand clothes!: The app definitely started out rough and glitchy but they have consistently been making improvements and now it’s great. I used to have to go to my desktop to do some actions and now I can do most everything on the app. Lots of great sales. I do the majority of my clothes shopping o. thredUP. And, they have AMAZING customer service.",5
2445,"Not what I hoped it’d be: I’ve sent two bags to thredUP. Personally I don’t think it’s worth sending well taken care of like new clothes, if you’re only going to make cents on them. The bags usually take a really long time to be sorted and listed online. I don’t know if they’re betting on you forgetting what you sent or not, but I’ve sent new, unused items, with tags attached, that never got listed. 

I don’t recommend using thredUP if your trying to make a profit. 

I do recommend using thredUP if you were going to donate to the thrift store anyway, and don’t care what you make or what they choose to sell.",1
2446,"Shopping Fun: ❤️ the site and pretty much all  my purchases have been good. 
 I forgot I was buying resale. Great designers and a HUGE selection of clothing ; shoes, handbags. I rate it a 10.

 Getting ahold of a live persons not going to happen. It is after all a 
Resale clothing site. There is no customer support but by chat.  I have to give it to the creator. Excellent job on a never done industry. I have to remind myself that it is resale. The quality is that exceptional! Great job",4
2447,"IMPOSSIBLE TO SEARCH: I tried to search for “lace jacket” and literally nothing came up. Yet, in the search bar, I can see that there are hundreds of options. I can NEVER find what I’m looking for. This app shows very limited results when I search for certain brands (even though there are more results on the actual website). I just want to find things in my size and taste and they make it incredibly difficult and frustrating. Also they should iron or steam the clothes before photographing them...  I can’t see what half the products look like all wrinkled up like that.",1
2448,"Disappointing: The idea of this app is cool, but it is a major let down. I sent in a huge bag of clothes and once it arrived I didn’t hear anything for months and the tracking info was never updated. Once Thread Up accepted some of my clothes and posted them for sale, I got a notification that I would be paid after they were purchased. As of right now three items are marked “sold” but I have not received any money for them. I started this process in the summer and now two weeks away from Christmas it hasn’t paid off at all. Will never use again.",1
2449,"Simply the best!: ThredUP has allowed me to create a new wardrobe that I really love, as opposed to just throwing pieces together. I love that I have exposure to brands I may not have worn before due to cost. I really love that I am assisting in less consumerism for me and the world at large by getting very cool clothing that just happens to be used. Great prices and I have even sent in a few bags.",5
2450,"Not good for consigners: I’m so disappointed in the consigning aspect. They practically take the entire selling price of the item. I made like 30 cents off a lularoe shirt. Then they take even more if you want to cash out. I sold a LOT of things and only made $30 then when I went to “cash out”, it change to $5. Ridiculous. Consign with Poshmark. So much better. They also charged me a fee to “get my items back” so I paid $15 extra on a box realizing now that you can actually get any of your items back without paying that. So what exactly did I pay for? Still not sure. Horrible.",1
2451,"Still great but used to be better: I love shopping at thredUP. However, there have been changes over last 7 months that I don’t like.
1) Skirts and dresses used to always have a numerical length, which is very helpful. They hardly ever do anymore.
2) When things were marked as having “minor wear” it used to describe what the “minor wear” was. Sometimes it doesn’t anymore.
3) People are getting lazy and marking things “Unknown Brand” when the price tag or the tag on the item very clearly state what the brand name is.
4) On a couple of occasions I’ve purchased things and the size on the tag is clearly not the size mentioned on thredUP. Same with the fabric of the items.
Otherwise, I love thredUP and will continue to buy from them. The clothes are great 98% of the time and the prices are too!!",3
2452,"Back to Basics: I appreciate the no nonsense, honest approach of thread up! Besides just being an all around great idea; they’re honest in the descriptions which I truly appreciate it. When I  received my first package, everything was wrapped up neatly and made me feel that is a company  I want to do business with. They pay attention to details  and the little things that mean a lot!",5
2453,"Poor customer service.: I've purchased items from them before, and loved them, but this last experience was a nightmare. I ordered a goodie box, which was stolen from my porch. I tried to contact customer service, but since I couldn't prove it was stolen (?!) I got charged for the entire thing, which amounted to almost $300. Every time I've talked to them, they want proof that it's missing - which I don't even know how to prove? That's the worst customer service I've received in a long time. So, it's a cool idea but just hope nothing goes wrong with your order because they won't help you.",1
2454,"I only shop here for clothing (for our entire family): I use thredup pretty much exclusively at this point, we have 3 young kids and I used to thrift in person for their clothes and mine but dragging them to goodwill is incredibly unpleasant at this season in life so almost all our clothes are from thredup!",5
2455,"Love Bargains: Just bought a nice pair of white pants for less than $11 with shipping.   I can hardly find that kind of bargain from a resale shop.  Love it!!!!

Only one problem is when you need to return an item.  It takes took over 6 weeks for them to process the return and issue a credit.   And of course they charged return postage.   

The web site is nice with good filters for what you are looking for.",4
2456,"I love it!: I love thrifting and whats better than an online platform with an endless selection. Theres some really overpriced items but they usually wont sell so you can save them for later and get notified of price drops. Overall, highly recommend checking them out!",5
2457,"Love this app but having a problem…: I loved this app soooo much and I still do. However, since the new update I have been having issues with saving searches. When I try to save a search, on my saved searches page it will show that the search was not found and instead show all women’s clothing. Please fix this issue!!",4
2458,"ThredUP: Prices are usually great, but the photos of the items leave so much out or simply do not agree with a printed description. They should show the interior of purses, for example.
And if the written description says “polka dot” the photo should show some dots! There are multiple listings where the photo looks like the item is a solid color, but the written description says “color block” or “polka dots.” Very frustrating.",3
2459,Merchandise is always as pictured!!!!!: I have ordered from them twice so far and I’ve always been very pleased the item is always as pictured exactly the items are very well cared for as far as packaging and I love their cute little polkadot boxes really cute will continue to shop here the prices are great happy customer!!!,5
2460,"genuinely obsessed: i barely buy clothing anywhere else these days, except for a few in person thrift stores. i can’t express how much i love thredup and all the one of a kind things i’ve gotten from here. the app makes it soo easy (maybe too easy!) to shop from my bedroom. i like how easy it is to filter lists and get too my liked list. it can be a little glitchy, as i get a little tiny error message that pops up at the bottom that says ‘unable to reach thredup’ but it never prevents the app from working. zero complaints about the app itself… and i cannot recommend thredup enough.",5
2461,Hidden Return Fees: Don’t be scammed by the sneaky return costs that 100% falls onto the customer. The “free shipping label” costs $8.99 and is deducted from your refund. I used Thred Up for years before I realized how much I spent on simply returning clothes. Thred Up should really be more transparent about their “free shipping labels” that aren’t free at all. This is a sneaky business practice. Disappointed in this company for not being upfront with return costs. I should mention the clothes arrive in terrible shape and need to be returned more often than they are kept due to quality issues.,1
2462,"selection of Item's: When I am putting items in my cart it is taking me a long time to go through Thred on items for shopping, cart is not allowing enough time for me and probably others to keep shopping because our cart gets emptied to fast.",5
2463,"Terrific app: I love this app and I’ve been pretty happy with my purchases. The only thing I would change is the item descriptions, that they would be a little more extensive. I also wish the wallets and handbags were photographed on the inside as well as out. Otherwise, a really great experience.",5
2464,"Great App & Selection: Love TU and have been a customer for a few years now, but I would love to be able to SORT MY WISH LIST. I’d like to sort by tops, jeans, coats, handbags, etc. Also I’ve noticed once I add favorite ❤️ something or add to my wish list, when I go back several days later it is no longer “hearted” ❤️ or favorited. Why??",5
2465,"Best online consignment store: I love thred up. Whether, I wanted to clean out my closet or buy a cute new shirt. Thred up has been my go to. Stay at home mom here! Money is tight and when you need new clothes, you need to shop around for deals. If you’re the slightest bit hesitant, no need!! Seriously, check it out and you’ll be hooked.",5
2466,"Shipping and tracking terrible: If everything goes smoothly, thredup is great. But when something goes wrong good luck getting it resolved. 
I spent $100 on an order that never arrived though it says delivered. It’s been 3 weeks, I’ve waited in chats to talk to them for lengthy times and each time they say they are looking into it and go quiet again. No followup, no communication, just me waiting in a chat line every other day asking for a refund or information. Very frustrating.",2
2467,"Easy to navigate: This app for the thredUP store is easy to navigate, view and see your rewards.  It would be nice if there were more picture per item but there are tons of items, so that would probably take them forever in manpower. Otherwise no complaints!",5
2468,"Fighting the Good Fight: I absolutely love thredUP. This company makes it easy to avoid fast fashion and allow customers to purchase high quality items while keeping them from the landfill. My only complaint with the app, is the search function isn’t entirely user friendly. It takes some trial and error looking for pieces, but overall love the app",4
2469,Just the best!: I have been using ThredUP for a few years. The filters make it a very efficient way to shop for high end brands in good condition at a reasonable price. I do all special occasion and KY Derby shopping here. The return process is quite simple as well so I can always return what doesn’t work. My go-to for shopping!,5
2470,Frustrated: I am very frustrated for three reasons 1 I sent a kit in early August and STILL have not heard or seen any movement on the app. I have sent several messages regarding this and only receive generic responses that due to high volume... 2. My clothes (all like new or new) are valued Very low 3 several items have been incorrect either not mine at all or mislabeled (again with no satisfaction) I am done with thred up! This will be my last kit!!!,3
2471,"ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT: They sent a CHILDREN’S size Large Marmot down vest instead of a Woman’s. Non returnable item. Emailed over a week ago, and attached photos and NO RESPONSE. No wonder this beautiful, yet TIMY vest was returned so many times that they marked it ‘non returnable’…It’s not a woman’s large! This company needs a customer service phone number, or an online chat rep. It is ridiculous to have to email and wait this long to hear back (if you do at All). I’m about to Facebook and Instagram my experience with Thred up - including photos. Frustrating company, with ZERO ways to contact.",1
2472,"Covid made me do it: So I gained like 15 lbs. blah. 
Anyway, there was no way I was going to sieve a fortune replacing everything now that I’m back at work in person. I spent $300 on an entire new wardrobe!!! Mostly brand  names too. I scored an Escada sweater for 4.99!!!! Try the outlet first bc it’s 40 percent extra off if you buy 20 items. I’ll never buy at the mall again.",5
2473,"Love this site!: Awesome app perfect for shopping second hand.  It's easy to use, find your size as well as returning.  I love shopping second hand, but I don't want to have to go out whenever I would like to.  I have never done the clean out option so I don't know how well that works.  Prices are reasonable.",5
2474,"No Customer Service - Shipping Rates Deceiving: I opted for the $5.99 bundle shipping option. When trying to use it, the app doesn’t acknowledge my original purchase for the bundle. I tried to contact customer support for help — support doesn’t exist. There is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. I sent an email, they said wait 5 days (after my bundle expires) or use chat function. Chat function is just a feedback loop of recommended answers to questions, no actual person to chat with for help. There is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT if you have questions or need help. Not shopping again.",1
2475,"Wonderful!!: This app is user friendly and the product is awesome!!! I do wish returns were better, you have to pay 2 fees but if the item is a brand good enough it’s worth it sometimes. Besides that I’m going to try the Love Box where they give you items from your favorites so hopefully that goes great. Fast customer service too.",5
2476,Gift card: Received a gift card. Tried to follow support steps online and it was impossible to find how to enter the gift card info with my credit card. 😞 forced to pay for purchase and not use gift card due to 1 hour sale after hours of searching.,5
2477,"Poor quality: I ordered 4 t-shirts, a polo, and a pair of swim trunks for my 11 year old son and I have never been so disappointed in a service like this one. (Mecari fangirl here) THREE pieces had holes in them. They would have thrown them in the trash had the been donated to Goodwill or the like. The polo was so clearly shrunk it was laughable... and the swim trunks I guess we’ll save them for next year because the sizing was super off on those too. I’ll give it one more go because now I have a credit because of these returns, but seriously... who’s in charge of quality control over there?",1
2478,Great but nothing special: The app itself and the whole search and buy process is perfect. Although I will say it’s a bit over priced. The clothes are mostly out of style and nothing stands out. If you are looking for day to day ordinary clothes then this is the app for you. I’d say for the younger shoppers this app is pretty bland. I can never justify spending 20 plus for a shirt I haven’t seen in the actual stores 2+ years,4
2479,Addicting: I love everything I have ordered from there so far. Make sure you read ALL the details BEFORE you buy. I didn’t the first time I bought a dress. I was initially shocked that it came to me stained and with a few holes but I looked at the description again and it did say ‘shows signs of wear’. So I oxycleaned the stains and stitched up the small holes and it looks good as new.,5
2480,TERRIBLE Customer Service System: AWFUL customer service system. I spent at least a MONTH trying to return items when it was their system that failed. And when I did get my refund I had to go back AGAIN to get the full refund and I’m pretty positive I still didn’t get all my money back.,5
2481,"Love it!: I literally don’t write reviews, but this app is the best. Fast fashion is our #1 polluter and Thread Up is actively working to change the statistics and I’m here for it. Amazing prices, amazing brands, and amazing quality. It’s all the wholesomeness of thrift shopping without the hassles of thrift shopping. I would recommend this to anybody especially those who love designer clothes but hate the price tag.",5
2482,"Perfect Holiday Party Dress: I came to thredUP looking for a classic, high quality LBD so that I can stop fussing over what to wear to an annual holiday party. It was very easy to filter down to exactly what I wanted (you can even categorize down to neckline and length). The prices were good, my items arrived on time, and were in really good shape.

This was the perfect compromise between my desire for thrift and good quality pieces.",5
2483,Fed up with thredUP: I started out as a bit of a thredUP addict. This began to change as I noted some differences in description and what was received. As an example the embellishments on a dress were missing and hanging loose - this was not stated clearly and the price was high considering the “damage”. Next was a pair of shoes for a wedding...the shoes were the same size but one was 1/2 inch shorter in length. Those I returned. The final order was a “goodie” box of t-shirts. Now I was excited to receive my “goodie” box but was horribly disappointed in the actual box. I was sent a box of children’s tshirts...seriously. Needless to say I am fed up with thredUP.,1
2484,"Obsessed!: I’ve never had a bad experience with ThredUP, and I’ve had plenty of purchases so far.  Affordable prices, great deals, decent shipping (sometimes fast, sometimes a few days longer than expected) and good quality items.  The app is easy to use - as is the website.  Great way to fill my closet for less when needed.",5
2485,Kit pay outs: I downloaded the third up and sent for the clean out bags. I filled the bags and had no problem just dropping them off and mailing them. I would get emails that I sold items  . I would get info. That I needed to lower my prices. But I cannot get my pay out funds or ability to change prices. My kit bag and app. Do not work together. So I cannot change prices or get get my sales $. I bought a shirt today ..but I could not use any of my sales funds. So beware ..they will take your clothes and sell them and sale to you but you will not get your money owed to you.,1
2486,"Don’t send them your clothes: Over past 6 months, I’ve sent 12 bags of clothes filled with designer clothes  from their “high demand” list. It takes them a minimum of 6 weeks to process a single bag and I was concerned  when a Burberry Jacket and other premium items mysteriously disappeared.  Another valuable Item was posted but the brand name (a popular) one was misspelled.  I wrote to Customer service and nothing’s happened.  Sending your clothes in is a crap shoot.  Worse, bags I sent in2 months ago and they still haven’f processed.",2
2487,"Impossible to make a return: Won’t let you view your label to print and make a return in hopes you just run out of time so they won’t accept it. Well within allowed time to make the return, I’ve emailed so many times as well as using their chat feature on the app where they claim to respond in an hour. I’ve already written another review and they responded to that telling me to email or chat with them. Same email I’ve already been emailing and same chat I’ve already been trying as well. Purposely unhelpful to force you to keep clothes and not make a return.",1
2488,"Yes, yes, YES!: This app and company is awesome! The selection is always great and very wide. Shipping and turn around times are great! The clothes always come in the condition is expect. There was only once when I got the wrong size from what I ordered and the exchange was very easy and quick. I have even sent in clothes I can’t wear to sell. I am now a frequent shopper! Highly recommend!!",5
2489,App makes second hand/consignment shopping easy and fun: Second Hand/consignment shopping can be daunting if you’ve ever done it in person. This app makes it easy and enjoyable. Easy to navigate and all the basic information you need to make an informed shopping decision is there. I’ve ordered Clean Out bags via the app and also shopped as well.,5
2490,"I order every 6-8 weeks & LOVE IT: It’s been a year now and I love Thred up.  I have not only saved so much money, but I feel I have a large selection for harder to fit sizes like “petite” tops and pants.  I love their return policy, even with new restock fee these are incredible savings.  I get work and casual wear clothes.  I recently started ordering for nieces and nephews and have not been disappointed.",5
2491,"Beware of all the “fees!”: I have been using thredUP since it first came online, and it’s no longer a good deal to shop here. Now they charge you extra money - $1.99 PER ITEM - when you send clothes back that you don’t want. That’s on top of the charge of shipping the items back (unless you want credit and not your money back, then they’ll pay for return shipping). It’s definitely fun shopping here. But it’s no longer a discount. You might as well buy new.",3
2492,"Handbags: I enjoy this site.  I just ordered a shoulder bag.  I was able to select the features thus reducing the number to look at to a manageable number.  I am very happy with the variety, and I really like the limiting of price to what I want to pay.  It is fun to browse.  We have no major stores here anymore.  They all picked up their chips and went away.  This “store” is open 24/7. I cannot beat that anywhere!",4
2493,"Great clothes, Poor service: I have really enjoyed the clothes I bought but when there was a problem with my shipping address, my clothes were not forwarded correctly and were delivered to Pennsylvania when I live in California. I contacted support services. After three attempts and 15 days, I’m giving up. Not even a response to propose a solution. Terrible.",5
2494,"Thredup: This site has been absolutely wonderful. I get clothes that I like and don’t have to pay full price. In the event you might have to return something, they make it extremely easy, they will return it free And give you store credit. Everything I have purchased has been in pristine condition. This is my favorite place to shop!",5
2495,"My Source for Clothing: ThredUP has upgraded my wardrobe completely ! I'm so thankful for finding this website. Why spend more when you can pay less for the same items most would spend more for? ThredUP is truly one of my favorite websites and I also love that if you spend a certain amount, you can get free shipping for the month!",5
2496,"Extremely Pricey: As an avid thrifter I know how prices should look. These prices are EXTREMELY too high for second hand clothing. I can find much cuter clothing articles at my local thrift store for an ample amount less. While the prices may be higher for the convenience of being able to shop from home, the significant amount of donations received by this company should outway the labor costs of uploading the items to the site. Don’t waste your money here, go to your local thrift store and support small local businesses.",2
2497,"Poor pay out rate.: I’ve sent 3 clean-out bags and the processing rate is extremely slow. I don’t understand what takes so long anyway, but I am keeping my mouth shut. Researched heavily on how much people made and I got really nervous. I have placed at least 35 articles of clothing in each bag, all neatly folded and cleaned, along with name brands and great brands. Hoping that my pay-out isn’t low as the people who made $3 when they stuffed the bag to the brim. STAY AWAY.

UPDATE!!

I have received, and get this, $2.95 for ONE bag. Seriously??? I couldn’t even buy a sandwich for that price at a local gas station... unbelievable...",1
2498,"Not for sellers!: So I sent out one bags with Kate Spade, Coach cross-bag and purses and some quality clothes that I wore a couple times. And another bag was filled with shoes and casual/office clothes. Because of my friends' recommendation, I was expecting to receive at least $100 after processing fees and others. NONE! They listed my cheap belt, shoes, and some skirts from J.Crew only. And none of my good quality bags and clothes were gone, I checked the website and they said it went to donation box. I DO NOT recommend. Don't need to waste money and time for your good clothes and bags. I rather to send to Goodwill or donation program for tax deduction.",1
2499,"Cheap interest? I don't think so for second hand: The clothes are a ok price, if you you go to a second hand store and find same brand, the prices are cheaper and you don't have to wait for shipping. This is more for people that don't have time to look around in person at second stores for second hand prices! I'm guessing it's because the app needs to make a profit too but charge more than in person preferences. So to me it's useless in saving money.",3
2500,"New 2 thredUP: This is the second time I order, and I am back because all the things my daughter and I purchased the first time were in excellent condition. 
Only one thing would make me even happier: no plastic packaging. Thank you thredUP for being part of the solution in taking care of our planet.",5
2501,"Horrendous site that does not pay for items they are selling!: Have sent in multiple bags of clothing. Almost every item sold that they listed and I have never received a single penny out of multiple bags of clothing- they kept all monies from sales of clothing I sent to them. Do not waste your time- at least donating to Salvation Army or women’s centers will get you a tax donation- these people CHARGE YOU postage, sell your items that you CONSIGN then do not give you anything at all??? Will be reporting for fraudulent practices, notifying USPS as it involves federal mail fraud as well",1
2502,Favorite online shopping app: Honestly I can’t begin with how convenient this is. You can type in brands or styles for just about everything. Need some new shirts? This app has it all. Anytime I need back to school clothes or a new accessory I go straight to thred up because it’s reliable and extremely cheap.,5
2503,"Amazing deals, but…: I’ve had really good luck on this site when it comes to everything EXCEPT for pants/jeans. I don’t know who puts in the measurements for pants/jeans but they are almost never correct on the length.🤦🏻‍♀️ Everything else is fairly easy to guesstimate if the item will fit based on the pictures. Again… tread carefully if you are purchasing pants 🤷🏻‍♀️",4
2504,"Most destructive app EVER: This app is eating my iPhone 13 Plus. After downloading this app, my phone’s battery life diminished significantly and the background light began flickering on and off. I had my phone serviced at the Genius Bar THREE TIMES and had the guts completely replaced. I also deleted this app after two techs noticed how much power it was draining from the battery. After the complete replacement, I waited a few weeks and then decided to reload the app. Bad decision! The app began draining my phone once again. It’s not my phone: it’s YOU. FIX IT!",1
2505,"Filter option not working: I love ThredUP for the most part, and shop there quite frequently. Brilliant conceptually, and it’s generally a great app, but I’ve noticed lately the filter option doesn’t seem to be working. For example, when I select “high rise” jean option, absolutely nothing is filtered out whatsoever. All rises show up in the feed. Also, the recently increase/doubling in “restocking fee” is a disappointment.",3
2506,ThredUP is a dream come true!!: I love this app so much!!! This is a dream for a working girl who loves thrift stores but never can make it… this is the most perfect thing anyone could ever think of!! Love love love!! Only wish they had men’s clothes but we know why they don’t  XD ThredUP has amazing quality and does a great job at helping you when you need it!,5
2507,"Please just tell us!: This is so frustrating. ThreadUp keeps changing how shipping and notifications are handled. This consolidation system is not working! I still get multiple, partially full boxes from the same warehouse, delivered on the same day. Now it takes longer and they stopped allowing us to track the delivery via FedEx. Put the shipping information back and quit acting like you are doing us any favors.",3
2508,":): The app glitches kind of frequently, but otherwise such a good company. I think 90% of my wardrobe is thredup at this point. Thrifting discounts and sustainability matched with a big enough selection that you can (probably) find the specific things you want, instead of in person thrifting where you have to be open to what’s in stock. I love it here.",4
2509,"Do not sell with these people: They miscalculated my pay out and I cant reconcile my books.  Worst?  Their app goes round and round, making you chase their ""customer service"" that isnt there.  It clearly states ""chat or email us"" but doesnt give you an email address to send billing questions.  How does selling payout of $6.36, $3.52, $2.70 equal NEGATIVE .30 cents, I will never know.  So, you move on with your life and accept that they sell your items for zero return.  If i wanted to donate my items, i would have done it locally... not with this company.",1
2510,"Excellent quality means something different: When I read on their site that an item is in excellent condition I do not expect to receive it with buttons missing or stains but, that’s what I get.  But, if I want to return I have to pay a restock fee.  Seems like a bait and switch situation to me.  I’m perfectly capable of sewing on a button or using a stain remover but, that’s not what I expect when I buy something in stated excellent condition,",3
2511,"The only place i online shop for clothes!!: I love thredUP! It is so easy to browse, find anything i am specifically looking for. Second hand is the best option for a sustainable wardrobe. It is easy to send my clothes in to sell them and easy to return items that i ordered that didn’t work out. Definitely give them a try!",5
2512,"Super convenient !!: This could possibly be one of the best thought of Apps out there!  It’s so easy to use, while simultaneously clearing out your house as well as making some extra money!!  I recommend it to ANYONE!!  LOVEE IT!!them to anyone clearing out their fabulous closet!  Not to mention the site itself, who doesn’t like to get a deal.  Super convenient to navigate!",5
2513,"Horrible site for sellers: This site is awful awful awful. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. I sent in a huge clean out bag of stuff - nearly 20 items - all in excellent condition, and they only accepted 10 items.  Who knows what they did with the other items as I did not want to pay to have them sent back to me.  Furthermore, 3 items sold and I made a whopping 0.56 cents. Wow!  Now I can buy my dream car.  What a joke.  If you’re planning on selling on this site, you may want to rethink that and sell somewhere else, because there’s up a total rip off for sellers.",1
2514,"Dangerously addictive: I lost a lot of weight and turned to this app to replace parts of my wardrobe. I got my first package and the item was exactly as described, and not something I would have afforded off the rack. Now, I’ve got more packages on the way. As long as you do your research on brands, this store is a godsend. But might have to delete it to stop buying because it’s so tempting!",5
2515,"Not good for selling, or anything really: ThredUP is one of the worst for sellers in my opinion. I have sold many things on here, but they take a huge cut and take FOREVER to get things listed. I sent in 3 boxes in March and they STILL have not processed them. They keep delaying blaming Covid, but no other sites seem to be delayed because of Covid anymore. ThredUP is a rip off and not worth the hassle. I will never sell there again and as a result of their poor service will never purchase from them either. Their website is a pain to navigate and as many have mentioned the app is useless.",1
2516,"So obsessed with this app !: I’m absolutely obsessed with this app ! I just installed it about a month ago and I’ve already made 4 orders. Every single item I’ve purchased ( 6 pairs or shoes, swim suit, 3 rompers, two blouses) have no signs of wear at all even when none had the “New with Tags”. Love love love it ! Very impressed with the shipping and packaging. Super cute.",5
2517,Clothes were labeled as wrong size.: I purchased three pairs of pants all in my usual size (12). They were all listed as 12. When the arrived they fit more like a size 6 or 8. Had to return all of them. I am still waiting for my return to be processed so I can get a refund but I’ve heard nothing from Thred Up. It’s been two weeks. It’s difficult to find out how to contact them. I feel ripped off. I wasted money having clothes shipped to me just to try them on and return them! They charge a restocking fee plus shipping costs if you don’t want store credit. Two thumbs down.,1
2518,Great for tall girls!: I’m 6ft tall and love thrifting. However it’s hard to find clothes long enough for my legs. Thread Up is so incredibly organized and has amazing filter options. I love how they include measurements of their clothes online! It’s great to know that a piece of clothing will be long enough for me before I order it! I haven’t found any other thrifting app that is as organized as Thread Up!,5
2519,"Waste of time & money: Wanted to try something new this time around in trying to sell/donate my old clothes. I sent two bags to ThredUP, one to donate (which is super cool of them) and the other to sell. In my selling bag I made sure to have nice items with sizing tags attached, no rips, etc. out of everything I sent over they only took 4 items and I was given $9...that’s it!! If you want to be ripped off then this is the place for you. You could get a LOT more money for your clothes at a local second hand clothing store. Thanks but no thanks ThredUP.",1
2520,The best!!!: I will only buy from this app and website for the rest of my life. I’m so in love with the brands and how the original price is super high but buying it for 75 percent off is a great deal. I’m so happy with Thredup. I got all my dresses from  three up and they’re all so gorgeous and still in good shape and absolutely beautiful. I’m so happy with what I got❤️❤️❤️,5
2521,"Best way to shop secondhand!!: I always hate shopping at an actual brick-and-mortar thrift store; it smells, it’s cluttered and I can never find my size. With ThredUP, I can filter by size, brand, and even material! The unboxing experience is so fun and colorful that you forget that it is used clothing. 

ThredUP has changed the way I look at secondhand clothing, I just see high-end clothes at great prices! #IChooseUsed",5
2522,Great!: Be weary about buying unbranded items from sight. The several items I bought were three sizes smaller than labeled but I was able to return them. The other items I have bought are amazing. I have also sold items and was not aware that I wouldn’t get my cash back until 14 days after the item sold. Definitely read the fine print when selling.,4
2523,"5 stars!!!: Everything is true to size, they are very honest interms of putting how used the clothes are, I bought my maternity clothes here, and everything looks brand new, the delivery was on time, prices were reasonable and most of all, there are alot of variety brands to choose for. 

No need to waste my gas going to the mall, just click and shop!;)",5
2524,"Good merchandise: I was delighted when received the items ordered.  Everything was nicely packed, arrived on time, and what I order was in excellent condition and what I would call new.  I saved money and it has become my favorite place to shop.  I also recommend the site and shared the link with family members.  Thank you for the savings.",5
2525,"Never delivered and incommunicado: I paid the deposit for a goody box 15 days ago. It is supposed to ship in 7 to 10 days. It hasn’t shipped yet; my order is still “processing.” When I emailed customer service, I got an automated response that it will take them a week to answer me because of high order volume. I ordered this box to use the clothes for a business trip and gave myself plenty of time to try them on and send them back before having to go. Now the business trip is tomorrow and I still don’t even have a word on when the box will be sent.",1
2526,"Used to be Good: This site used to be better as the would often have sales and discount codes. I’d wake up eagerly on holiday mornings to shop there. But now I’m really disappointed. They rarely have codes available and their sales don’t discount everything anymore. When you price a used dress at $60, then you need to be offering more discounts! (It’s Ralph Lauren btw which I can easily get for $25 elsewhere). I like thredUP for the variety, convenience and for killing time at work, but the pricing and sales have really spurred me on a company that I used to order from multiple times a month.",1
2527,"Customer service non existent: ThredUP is terrible if you ever need help from a human being. I have received items not as described, incorrect items, damaged items, etc. Customer service is only available via chat and only during a certain timeframe. They stopped providing measurements on many items and instead tell you to look on the brands website for size info. It’s just another way to get out of people returning items due to incorrect measurements. If you don’t ever return items or if you don’t mind mislabeled pieces, stick with thredUP. Otherwise stick to theRealReal.",1
2528,"ThredUP review: As long as you read descriptions and Google the brand to compare prices you can find some good deals as any other second hand service. 
I have had a couple crappy buys.
The one thing is don’t expect speedy delivery. The normal delivery is 5 days. But it takes ThredUP 5 days to box and ship it themselves. My biggest complaint is there is no urgency to complete a shipment.",4
2529,"Love buying clothes!: This app makes buying clothes easy! The clothes are “second hand”, but often still have the tags still on them or look brand new. They have a large selection of lots of different brands in many different sizes including plus sizes. They even have childrens’ clothing. The prices are competitive too!",5
2530,"It is addicting!: Love having a place to sell my nicer clothes that I don’t want to just give away, but love shopping on the app even more! What other store has new items every hour? At fantastic prices! Helps support my shopping addiction and love of clothes, plus it feels great to get a designer piece at a fraction of the cost. Also love that I can return items I don’t love.",5
2531,"A Joy to Shop!: ThredUP (currently) has over a million pieces listed. I have been shopping with them for years and have found their descriptions and evaluations to be accurate.
The app makes it very easy to sort, filter and customize. I’m very happy with the very affordable and often unique finds!",5
2532,"Not happy: Lately it seems like prices have gone up. Also I just sent in a bag to sell and the pay out is ridiculously low for pieces they are selling at 3-4 times the price. I have spent a lot of money on this site, however lately it seems to be going down hill. I think Thredup could profit more from being more fair on payouts and lowering the prices on these so called thrift deals. Do your research because some of the used items are more on this site than the brand new ones on an original site.",2
2533,"Good, but...: I have purchased several times from this source, and find both pluses and minuses:

PLUS

- good selection of clothing at good prices. The “like new” products are really like new. 
- easy to return (although it takes a long time for them to generate a return slip)

MINUS

- customer service not very responsive
- the filters are often unhelpful.  They either omit products that should fall within the filter category or they include products that don’t fall within the category. That forces you to minimize filters and go through a long listing of products that do not fit your search.  

I must say, though, that this app can be addictive especially if you return an item and build a credit. I inevitably buy more clothes than I need. But that’s my problem.",3
2534,"Good app. But you don’t get much cash: The app and website are slick and easy to use, the clean out bag process is easy. However, be prepared to get very little for your products, even for higher end products. We’ve sold through ThredUp twice now. We had immense amounts of kid clothes we got rid off and most of it we gave to a local goodwill, however, the pricier and “nicer” clothes we filled up a bag; really packed it with Mini Boden, Hanna Anderson, Patagonia, Keen shoes (worn twice), Kicky Pants).  For example, a Hanna Anderson girls dress merits me .50 while they sell it for $15. You are better off going to a local consignment shop.",1
2535,"So Disappointed: So I just downloaded ThredUP about 2 months ago and I loved it until now. I thought this was a legitimate business, but they have no phone number to call and their chat is only available 7-11 M-F. A full time business should be open during normal business hours....
Anyway I sent them an email 5 days ago and no response from that method either. 
I am really disappointed because this will end my buying from them. I have spent close to $300 on items and had plans to continue buying until I realized how hard it is to contact them.",1
2536,"Love buying but Returning and Selling is a drag: I love this Ap in being able to save money. However, returning  and selling is a while other beast. You kind of feel left in the dark. Shipping labels are provided for returning at additional cost and one is provided for selling but there is no email, or information on whether it was received, processing,ect. I even contact customer service and it takes days for them to respond. Still waiting on a response.",3
2537,"Terrible!!!: Sold several items (27) with tags on them and made $10. What a rip off! The process to sell takes forever. Then they listed a few items wrong (brand) and I reached out to let them know and it was never changed. Also, after selling I got a generic email from someone in corporate asking about my experience. I wrote back with a tactful email full of suggestions and my thoughts and I never received a reply. I will not be recommending this to anyone! Even to shoppers because this company is making a lot of money by ripping people off for their clothes.",1
2538,"WARNING NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AVAILABLE: I’ve contacted ThreadUp in regards to a purchase I’ve made and it’s nearly impossible to get ahold of someone. Their chat is bot. You won’t get anywhere. If you contact them via messenger they won’t respond. They don’t have a customer service number and you can forget abt email. Truthfully ordering from this company is a huge gamble. You’ll have to take your losses cuz they ship, faded, torn items and good luck sending them back or getting your money!! Worst thing, is they don’t list on their description. Shame on them!!",1
2539,"Logs out account every time you reopen the app: You can’t seriously expect users to log back in every time the app reopens. Sometimes it’s just switching between apps and you’ll get logged out. Has made me no longer want to use thred up because the user experience is so bad. The log in screen for some reason looks like a sign up screen as well? Not well designed, and I remember the app working better at some point in the past so I don’t know what happened.
App is constantly updated but this persists.",1
2540,"My Go to store: ThredUP is terrific. Easy to navigate, great filters to make searching for something specific even easier, tons of choices, quick turn around, excellent customer service… ThredUP is where I go first when I need something to wear. 
The only downside is that it can be addictive!",5
2541,"Charges to sell have gotten to high: The charge for the clean out and the amount they price some of my items most recently, one made me wonder if they were marking some artificial low to allow an employee to buy them, two made it clear I will not make anything on the items I sent in that took months to process, and lastly means I won’t be using thread up any more and will take items to our local children’s consignment shop.",2
2542,Rip off: Please read their clause carefully before sending your name brand clothing to them. It takes them over three months to complete your clean out so it’s available on their website for sell. They price your clothes at brand new prices which is what they get to keep and give you a very low percentage for your clothes when bought. I promise you that this company is ripping you off by only paying you a $1 or $2 maybe less while they pocket $20 to $100 maybe more for your name brand clothing!,1
2543,"Items in terrible shape but listed as minor wear: Great idea… terrible execution. Had a $43 “credit”, there was a discount, and I still spent $125 on wool items. Better off buying new. Worst Item arrived full of holes, shrunk, felted, and different size than stated. It should have been recycled. Gave me less credit than I paid. Three items were shrunken by at least a size, another had a hole, and one was covered in pills. Not at all up to the quality listed. Would not have paid more than $15 locally if I selected them at all. Done with ThredUp!",1
2544,"Improvements still needed, but better: I continue to have problems with the app and the chat option, but I did receive a response to an email I had sent. The representative was very direct in their response and fixed an issue for me immediately. I honestly hadn’t expected that response and was more than pleasantly surprised.",4
2545,Super ez and friendly mobile app use: I really like it because it simple and shop anywhere and anytime. Payment process is nice and sometimes app Notification tells you a good deal. They also tell you their HQ updates and news about impact and sustainability. Love it! Thank you!,5
2546,"Terrible.: I’ve given thredUP multiple chances, but no more. They take 100 years to process your bags, and then list 5 out of 20 items at ridiculously overpriced prices, but only pay you out a couple bucks. 

The math is also incorrect. It says I have $9 I’m able to cash out, but the total of my sold items/money owed is around $20. They never get back to people and it’s just really sketchy. 

Also, the clothes they accept and list are super outdated. They need to just give up and shut down. Better off donating",1
2547,"Downhill: This use to be my go to for shopping. Lately, their quality in product has gone down hill. They have turned their chat service off and finding anyone to help is impossible. Clothes claimed to be brand new with tags only have tag of brand with NO description of item on tag anywhere! This is a bold face lie to the consumer. They also want to charge a 3.99 restocking fee when it use to be 1.99. Buyer beware. Nothing they sell is what it claims to be online. Shame as they use to be very good and one of my favorites apps.",1
2548,"I’m FedUp with ThredUp!: I’ve been using ThredUp for years to buy and sell and I’m now FedUp with it. The search engine is lousy, usually it takes forever for purchases to arrive, the restocking fee was recently doubled, it’s difficult to reclaim your items, the cart timer is far too short to work well, and now I have a rather large “credit” in my account and customer service won’t respond to my questions about closing my account and accessing all of that money! This is not worth the hassle or the “lost” money.",1
2549,"So happy!: Really made my day, all my purchases were outstanding!
I just couldn’t believe it everything I ordered was even better than I expected. Beautiful just beautiful! Will definitely shop again and recommend to everyone. From clothes to purse’s and handbags excellent.",5
2550,"Good Selection - SLOW and Terrible Pics: Shipping is very, very slow. And the pics are awful! In today’s world, it’s so easy to give multiple pics at different angles etc., but ThredUP only puts the effort into two. Total disappointment. As such, I’m reluctant to shop here as much as I’d like, and I definitely won’t sell here. I would also think that they would be able to figure out a faster shipping process. Waiting 7-15days to get an order is ridiculous anymore.",2
2551,"Love thredUP: ThredUP is my new favorite shop. I get so many amazing pieces in excellent condition. I’ve purchased Athleta, lululemon, aqua, joie, dkny, nux, Zella, and more at really good prices. Most items were in new condition and I was able to address any concerns I had with a customer service rep on chat. Check it out for yourself! You will not be disappointed.",5
2552,"Pros and Cons: My go-to shopping app 

Pros 
- good deals and overall reasonably priced 
- environmentally friendly 
- well packaged, items are never too dirty 
- great app for filters and searching 
- my go-to for shopping 

Cons 
- shipping sometimes takes weeks instead of 3-6 days to consolidate order with minimal customer support 
- they track your contacts in the app… why would they need this data? Seems creepy. 
- clothing isn’t always great quality can be seen through or super funky even though it’s priced like new clothes 
- some cheaply made clothes / fast fashion is priced higher than it would be new, like forever 21, Shien, etc. 
- clothes are not always well cleaned, I’ve had pieces come with trash in their pockets, or huge stains.",3
2553,Everything is perfect- Add a menswear section: I love the app and everything about it. Especially the high frequency of sales and discounts TH ye offer. But I want to be able to buy menswear for my friends and family. If this was added this would be the perfect app. I use this more than goodwill because the searching is already done and categorized for me.,4
2554,"Amazing experience: On the whim I decided to order a handful of dresses since after a great additional discount they all came to what one single dress would have been retail, and I’m SO pleased. Every one of them fit beautifully, they’re clean, and no one will ever know they were second hand. This is a great concept.",5
2555,This is what shopping should be: I love shopping here. It’s convenient and I know that I’m getting good quality at a great price. The only thing I wish wish wish they would add to their descriptions is whether or not there are pockets in pants/skirts/dresses. Extremely important deciding factor and it is very hard to tell in photos.,5
2556,Why NO Customer Service?: Customer service is pretty much nonexistent. I’ve been waiting for an order for over two weeks and it’s still sitting in Indiana and I live in California. There is no one to contact to find out when I will receive my order. Items previously received were not as described and I still had to pay return shipping and restocking fee on them. If I ever receive my order this will be the last time I order from them.,2
2557,Buyer/seller: I love buying and selling on thred up. Platform is easy to use and you can find great deals as well as make some money from selling clothes you no longer wear. Daniella from a customer service is fantastic. She is professional and kind and always responds quickly to emails. Thank you Daniella and thred up!,5
2558,"Shipping really needs to improve: I’m not concerned with the amount of time it took for my items to arrive; it was the lack of updated communication via the tracking link supplied.  Tracking for my items remained inaccurate for 6+ days.  Since this is my first order with treadUP I was concerned I had been scammed.
I did chat with customer service. They were very helpful in finding my order, they did not have any further updated info.",3
2559,"Don’t sell with them: I have sold through Thred Up in the past and it’s been fine. However, this last go around I sent my bag back in JULY and still 4 months later have received no word as to whether they received it or processed it. And for customer service trying to resolve it? Forget it...it’s tough to reach anyone at all and when you do it’s a bot...finally talk to someone and they give you the run around. I sent a lot of very nice things that I should have just donated. Won’t sell or shop here again and I don’t recommend selling through them at all.",1
2560,Great clothes great prices: Great quality clothes at great prices.  Love that you can get something a little used that is great quality for cheaper than some new poorer quality clothes.  Some of the clothes I have purchased I have worn over a year.  I am starting to find nice things for my kids too.,5
2561,"Loving it so far!: Both my roommate and I have each received our first goodie box subscriptions and love the items they sent! 

Everything was good quality, many items still with tags on. They’re stylists did a good job reviewing our likes and Pinterest boards to really capture our individual styles!

I took off one star because their customer service can be slow to respond, and because my return took longer than expected, but I suspect that had something to do with the COVID. 

Can’t wait for my next box and to see if things run more quickly in the future!

I would most definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a eco and budget friendly cloths subscription!!",4
2562,Buy used - it’s the smart way to shop!: I love this app! I’ve been using it for a couple years now and have bought numerous things - all exactly as described and all arriving on time. I’m a young professional so I like to dress nice but I don’t want to spend a fortune on clothes or a lot of time looking for them. That’s why this app is perfect for working women like me.,5
2563,Their prices went up which makes them just like all the other websites :(: I LOVE ThredUP and have more than 1 account that I order from for tax purposes. I’m extremely bummed that they’ve recently massively moved their prices up which unfortunately- doesn’t make sense considering they advertise as a second hand/used store. In my opinion- second hand or used stores have low low prices. This also means there isn’t anything unique about them anymore. I’ll be looking for other used stores. :(,2
2564,"Easy way to shop from my couch!: I needed a very special item- red blazer.  It was quick, affordable, and fast! I have utilized EBay with varying results. I would rank this much higher in the ability to find what you are looking for. I have not had the need to return anything yet - and have purchased twice.  I would recommend it!",5
2565,"Thrift Shopping at Home: I’m having so much fun. When I go to a thrift store, I have my game face on. I inspect clothes for holes or marks to make sure that I can actually wear the piece. I really love the fact that I can trust the garments will be as described. 

I also absolutely freaking love that I can filter for garments based on MATERIAL (cotton, linen, etc). Only Nordstrom’s let’s me shop that way. Keep up the good work!",5
2566,"Home Shopping: I am currently home bound healing from a broken femur. Dresses are the easiest to wear right now with all the therapy and using a walker. I found several in short order and have shopped Thred Up before. I am confident that my purchases will be perfect or can easily be returned for store credit without leaving my home - during my recovery! Thank you, Thred Up!",5
2567,Start to hate this app: I hate that they don’t give you enough time to hold items and when you click on add to cart it ends up in someone’s cart. There shipping stinks. When you contact them they don’t contact you back. I ordered a ring with one of my orders and I contacted them and never got my ring or a refund or anything from them.,5
2568,Why didn't someone think of this sooner?: Great app for cleaning out the closets. They don't pay a whole lot for your items unless they're high end. I love being able to get more for credit rather than payout. Then I put those dollars to use getting great deals on items I otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.,5
2569,"Horrible customer service.: Needing a few dresses for wedding season I placed 2 orders with several items each.
They came in about 6 different packages over the course of about 2 weeks. 
Unfortunately I needed to return quite a few of them. There’s no number to call, the live chat option never connected me to a person, and 3 emails over a weeks time went without and answer. When someone finally did answer me, EVERY item I was sending back had been marked down for my refund! I like the idea of buying used, but the return process is a joke.",1
2570,"Shop Elsewhere Quality is a Joke: Was so excited for my first purchase. Ordered 3 dresses. All of which were detailed as a like new or brand new with tags… One dress was so tattered and torn I had to throw it away. The second dress had so much static that it wouldn’t uncling from itself and could not be worn. The third dress was described as XL and came in small.

Returning these purchases cost more than the total purchase itself. No one cared when I called or emailed. No one tried to correct the wrong sizes. I was told tough luck. 

Clean up bag. Sent 22 items all in far better condition than the clothing I purchased. All new within the past year and definitely within the outdated fashion items I have seen online. Three of my items had never been worn. I received $2.30 for 6 items. What a joke.

I have not had one decent experience with this company. Done, deleted, will NEVER USE OR RECOMMEND again.",1
2571,"Seller Beware!: I have used thred-up for years, but for the past year I have been less than impressed. When I send clothes to them I don't get notifications or credits for months, yet there on the site was my Etro skirt. They had time to post it, but not time to notify me or send me a pay-out? I ordered a suit and I get an email that they don't have the blazer. I also recently bought a shirt that was mislabeled.  It is a shame because I usually use my credits to buy other items so they are making money off me.  I use to love it. I would not recommend them at this point.",1
2572,"Do not sell to them.: I am torn. I LOVE the things I have found on th site--- I've gotten Equipment, Joie, Guess- on this site.  However they do not pay out fairly at all. Do your research! The ""retail"" strikeout price is sometimes super inflated as was the case of a pair of my shoes I saw on the site. I reached out to customer service but have yet to hear back. I received a third of what my bag was worth.",5
2573,"Shopping success!: I love this app! You never know what you’re going to find, which makes it all the more fun! My only complaint is the pictures of listed wallets. It would be great to see pictures of the wallets opened so we know what it looks like on the inside and if it’s a trifold or not.",5
2574,"Who are these people hiring?: This app is great as a concept. Not so great in reality. I would LOVE to say amazing things. But simply put? It’s terrible.

Their measuring is all over the place. For shoes, no length measurement (heel to toe) on heel height. I could have two of the same exact shirt and size and the bust will be like 5” apart. Same with jeans. And they don’t include the name of the type of jean per brand in the description. Idk who they hired to measure these clothes or enter the measurement data, but it is the sole reason I refuse to buy anything or become hesitant to buy anything from this app. 

I will gladly get hired on to run your measurement department. You fix that, you make more money. 

I’m blown away by how frustratingly overlooked that detail is. Online thrifters are OCD about having measurements readily available. #1 question asked on any listing on any site. 

I mean… come on.",1
2575,"My Go To!!: I have shopped ThredUP for years & love it! When you have favorite brands it so easy to find more of what you like! Coats, sweatshirts, shoes & sunglasses-I’ve found sooo many greats pieces! I’m near one of the warehouses & usually choose items located there for quick shipping! Knowing it’s better for the environment is always a plus!",5
2576,Wrong size and returns: This company sent the wrong size boot and returns are horrible difficult. It showed I could start a return and then the next screen said it wasn’t available for return yet. This website is terrible to find your steps for a return and then the company reflects just the opposite of the website. The company needs a lot of work to be customer friendly. It also needs a better system ordering items.,2
2577,"Skeptical: I was a skeptical customer, having sent about 50 pieces of clothing in good condition or NWT. Then I ordered 7 pieces and thought none of them would fit or look right. I was WRONG. Everything fit and I am amazed. Also I am a customer for life. My closet is now ½ full and I am a very happy woman. Thank you ThredUP, you are amazing",5
2578,"Straight up scam: This company used to be amazing, but it has seriously gone down hill. Prices are higher than brand new items from store, description and quality aren’t accurate, measurements are off, and frequently items will be incorrectly marked with different brand names. Most importantly though, they now charge you to basically donate your clothes. High end items don’t get accepted with no explanation, they don’t do it ent anything anymore. They used to photograph everything. This company is scamming customers.",1
2579,"Kind of a bummer: I’ve been using thredup for 3 years now. When I first started there were so many wins and the quality was amazing. Now, three years in, and the quality of a joke. I have received so many strained/damaged items that were listed as ‘like new’ or ‘new with tags’. Not to mention that items are constantly listed incorrectly. 
This doesn’t even touch their crappy rewards system. 
I’ve tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but I am over being burned. Spend your money elsewhere.",1
2580,"New favorite: All my favorite brands at affordable pricing.  The only thing I would love to see added is an option to see the clothing tags. For instance I can not tell what kind of Express pants are featured, if I could see the tag I would know for sure that I was getting my favorite style, the Editor style.",5
2581,Best way to buy and sell second hand clothing!!: I have been using thredUP for over three years now and I absolutely love changing up my wardrobe buying and selling online!! I like to change my style often and threadUP allows me to do that!!!  I also purchase clothing for my grandkids here too.,5
2582,"Only one thing could make it better: I love ThredUP. The shopping experience is like a treasure hunt and the quality of my purchases is always better than expected. My one complaint is that everything is shipped via FedEx, so I’ve never received my purchases by the estimated delivery date. They’re always 1-3 days later than expected.",4
2583,"Love it, but would like to be able to clean out!: When I AM able to send in a clean up bag, I sell about 50%. But I haven’t been able to ask for a clean up bag for several months now. I typically like to let my credits pile up to make a pretty big buy, but now I’m empty. And I have piles of kids and women’s clothes piling up since the cold season started.",4
2584,"The absolute worse resale site: Thread-up is something else. I sent very nice  clothes in July that would be great sales for fall, winter, and Christmas.  Was told process time would be Octoberish. Wow, January 23rd and they  have now processed a huge box of nice things and they  will sale 5 of my items. Wow, AND who will buy 5 winter items right now? Everyone is looking at  Spring and Summer. I would never recommend this company to anyone to sell clothes. You cannot even get in touch with them through customer service. HORRIBLE-run as fast as you can.",1
2585,"Use to be great!: Have sent my gently used clothes here for 3yrs and would make great money! Since Covid like everything else, Thread Up hasn’t been the same. My recent bag took over 6 months to be processed normally this isn’t an issue but only 2 items were selected and I was expected to receive $1.50… then both items only had 30 days to sell so I ended up with nothing… waste of time and energy unless you have designer items.",2
2586,"My Go-To App for Reliable Online Thrifting!!!: I’ve been using ThredUp since 2019 and am always impressed with the clothes I find! I’m a avid thrifter and love finding good quality clothing for a good price! I recommend ThredUp to everyone who’s looking for clothes at a reasonable price! I hope to see more people using it! 

Thank you ThredUp!!!",5
2587,What I like about thredUP: I am 74years old and a life long thrifter. I’ve made good choices and foolish choices. This sight shows me the actual item I’m purchasing and offers me a variety ways to save. Nothing worse than seeing stock photo and being disappointed when the item arrives!,5
2588,LOVE: I needed nice business shirts/pants but didn’t want to do the fast fashion thing or spend way too much on name brand clothing. For my first purchase I got 2 nice Ann Taylor shirts for a great price and they look brand new and look amazing on!! The only downfall to shopping online is you can’t try things on and if you don’t like something there is return fees so for that I give it 4 stars.,4
2589,Amazing!!!: I started a new job and needed to fill my closet with business casual work clothes. I have saved soooo much money and I’m loving all the choices I have at great prices.  Also a benefit is being able to return items that don’t fit or are not my style when I receive them.  ❤️❤️❤️,5
2590,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!: You will not receive your items and there is zero customer support/assistance. Because items are shipped by individuals and you don’t see any seller information, thredUP can’t and won’t do anything if a package (or in my case three) are lost. There is no way to get in touch with them, chat takes you nowhere and emails go unanswered. FedEx also will not be of any assistance and will ask you to contact the shipper, which you can’t. I have to file claims just to make sure I don’t lose all the money I spent.",1
2591,"Mixed reviews: While it is a great concept to buy second hand, like most online shopping it’s very hard to know how the fit and condition of a used item will be. And I have had some very strange smelling items arrive. I’ve had mixed reviews on items and unfortunately the cost of restocking hardly makes the return worth it, so you end up with credit after credit.",3
2592,"I shop here for almost everything!: Amazing selection, fair prices, easy navigation and search filtering. I hardly shop anywhere else for myself and my son. The quality is always above expectations, too! Plus it’s better for the planet to shop used! Love it, all of it.",5
2593,"Good to shop, but not to sell: This summer I got 2 clean out kits from them and I filled them to the brim! I sent in some high end items that still had tags, never worn or barely worn expediting to get at least 50% of the profit back if not more. turns out I only receive $1-$2 for an item I paid $50 on and never wore. If you are trying to sell your clothes for a profit probably stick to marketplace or postmark.",3
2594,My new favorite: I’ve bought like half my closet on this site and i can’t wait to buy more. Everything is so good quality and have great prices too. Homecomings in a week and ive found a really pretty dress here and it wld probably be SOOO expensive anywhere else. best place to buy everything i love it,5
2595,"Love it!: I love using the app for tracking my saved searches, items I favorited and items I’m selling. 
I wish some of the features available in desktop only were available in the app such as buying rescue boxes or the estimated date when your clean out bag will be processed.",5
2596,"RIDICULOUS: We’ve been waiting weeks for 2 orders, one of which is a single item. 3 and counting. Tracking updates every few days to say it’s postponed another several days. There’s no customer service number, and trying to chat thru the app just prompts me to log in and log in and log in and log in again. I’ll be surprised if these clothes ever come at this point, and I can’t even imagine trying to return something. I’ll just eat the cost of what I end up having to give away I imagine. Don’t do it.",1
2597,Shipping is SO slow!!!: I love the idea of buying used but ThredUP’s prices have gone up significantly in the last couple of years and their shipping times have lengthened almost unacceptably. They say they’re trying to decrease their carbon footprint but taking two weeks to ship a package with FedEx that then takes another 10 days to make it from AZ to CA is unacceptable. I used to buy 90% of my clothes on ThredUP but I don’t feel like waiting for almost a month for each package.,2
2598,"Great Service: I just received my first Thred-Up order. I was pleased with the short Shipping times, Fed Express Ground delivered the package on Sunday!
I ordered 3 ‘Kimonos’ Cover-ups to wear with revealing Clothes that I want only my Fiancé to see.
All 3 are just as pictured! One was actually even more beautiful than the picture!! 
Thank you for such a great Service!! REPURPOSING, is something many of us were taught and participated in even as kids. Today at 62yo I consider myself to be a ‘Black Belt’ in ‘Repurposing/Bargain Shopping , lol!! 
Again, Thank you for joining the group of other Vendor sites that facilitate this very important Conservation program! ♥️👍
Sincerely,
Ms Marty Trujillo-Cody",5
2599,"I would Not mistake for Brand New: Wish I could include pictures. Received 2 shirts today one had multiple large (2 to 3 inch) snags in the back, the other had multiple spots. Very disappointing and will be returned. I have ordered previously and did not encounter this problem. Hope it’s due to the staffing shortages we are also experiencing. May update",4
2600,"Good but: Really like the app but a recent update broke the search for items up for bid. Sorting by bids ending soonest doesn’t work any more and if I star an item that’s up for bid to come back to it later, it doesn’t save in my Favorites like it used to and then it’s a hassle to try to find it again",5
2601,Great for planet conscious people!: Haven’t had an issue yet! Just the regular you deal with from buying online (not being positive on sizing and such). I enjoy being able to thrift even while the stores are closed due to Covid-19. Also love being able to send in my clothes and know that they will be either resold or properly recycled!,5
2602,"Terrible Customer Support: I love the concept of recycling clothes and have purchased several items I enjoy. However, when I was stuck in a situation trying to return items before the cut off date due to a malfunction of the app, I made several attempts for help through Live Chat and never got a response. Very disappointed.",4
2603,"used to LOVE, now I only like a lot: I’ve used ThredUp for about a year and I used to love seeing that polka dot box/bag on my porch.  My last two orders have been a bit disappointing; a shirt listed as “mistake for new” is clearly used, a pair of pants not the right size, the return process was easy, but still.... 

I’ve also noticed that the pricing, which used to be reasonable and appropriate, seems to have increased by about 50%. 

I appreciate that they are in business to make money,  but I was a more satisfied customer last year. No doubt, they are growing, (good for them) but with these changes, they will continue to make money, but possibly with more unsatisfied clientele.  

Here’s to hoping ThredUp goes back to the good ole days.",3
2604,"Love, love, love: I adore ThredUP!! Convenient and easy. Sometimes things can be labeled incorrectly and I wish they did side photos as well as some items you can clearly see a design or words but don’t know what it is. Another thing that would be cool is if they had a men’s section. My husband would love to also shop here but he can’t. I do love the kids section for my niece.",4
2605,Smell: I recently finally tried ThredUp for the first time and ordered 5 items. They came in 2 different packages from 2 different places. Which is fine except the second package I received stunk sooo bad. The three dresses that came in this shipment smell horribly like mildew. Hopefully after I wash them 3-4 times it will wash out but I’m not sure if that’ll be enough. Seriously if this is what it continues to smell like I will never order from this place again and I definitely won’t recommend it to anyone else. That’s disgusting!!!,2
2606,"Small Changes, Big Effect: This is a good app and particularly convenient in a pandemic, with online ordering and mail in for sales. In addition they have a variety of inventory to offer. However, over the course of 2020 it appears that the prices have noticeably increased and currently you can’t even send in clean out bag. In addition, the rates that sellers get from this app are negligible, you’d be better selling on a different app if you wanted to truly see any cash.",3
2607,Fantastic Value and Fun to Shop!: I have made multiple purchases and have found some amazing clothes and handbags and shoes for a fantastic value!  Some items don’t fit or I change my mind and returns are easy.  It’s so fun to bargain hunt for my favorite brands.  This is the best idea for secondhand name brands AND an eco-friendly mission.  I’ve been loving ThredUP!,5
2608,"Love Thred Up!!: I was skeptical at first, but was completely satisfied and thrilled with my purchase! 
The items I purchased were in excellent condition and I receivedb them immediately.
The selection of clothing is amazing and the Affirm billing process was super easy and so convenient.
I am going through a divorce so my credit is not perfect, being able to use Affirm was a huge help to me.
Thred up is just the thing I needed to be able to buy new clothes, not break the bank, and feel good about my new affordable look!
Thred up is my new go to clothing store and I would recommend them to any one who wants to look great and save money while doing so!",5
2609,Not worth selling: I sent a bag of high quality clothing and purses. Only half the bag was uploaded to sell. My coach purse and coach backpack were not posted for sale. Both were only used a couple times and in excellent condition. I tried contacting support to get my items back with zero results. The percentage you actually get for each item sold isn’t worth the trouble. I had two pairs of jeans sell and made just over $3. This app is a rip off. Much better just taking your gently used clothing to a local consignment shop! I will never use this app to sell clothing again.,1
2610,"Great service, mediocre app: I don’t like shopping but love thread up.  I don’t mind taking chances on used clothing with a modest restocking fee.  The price and fact that it’s used takes the pressure off finding the PERFECT shirt and lets me enjoy trying new looks. 
 
The app search could be A LOT better but the site doesn’t offer a place for suggestions so sorry, I don’t think they’ll be improving anytime soon.",4
2611,Love the idea...but: I love the idea of thredUP I think it’s amazing. But I have such a hard time finding what I am looking for on the app. I know exactly what Levi’s I want but I can’t search the style number. I know what style jacket or shoes I’m looking for but random things come up instead. And so far I have only been satisfied with half the items I have bought. I still use the app but really only for gym clothes now.,4
2612,Terrible customer service: I received an item from a brand I wear reliably in the size I always wear. It was way too small. I wrote customer service several times asking to return it since it was falsely sized and hence falsely advertised—zero response. They should not call it customer service but customer disservice. Any company that ignores its customers has a terrible business model and a lot of explaining to do.,4
2613,Good prices: I’ve ordered several items and had good experiences with all but one of the items ordered. Make sure you zoom in and actually look at the item and read the description that talks about fading or marks etc... but all in all- I’ve had a good experience with them- faster shipping would be nice though.,5
2614,"Love thredUP: I love shopping with thredUP! Bought clothes from them and all went smoothly. My onIy thought would be more search narrowing options. For example, I am a size 4 on bottom, but 6/8 on top -“my sizes” perhaps could distinguish between measurements. I love when they have the clothing measurements in the description- I wish they could always do this.",5
2615,"Threadup: I have loved most of everything that i have purchased on this site. I have also returned a few things with ease. I really love all the coupons that are offered, right on this site! I am truely enjoying using this site and will continue to make many more purchases here! Ty",5
2616,"Just...wow: Upcycling clothing and buying used has become a way of life for me. It’s not only more eco friendly, but creates less waste in the clothing industry. I’ve never really been able to find good clothing in local thrift stores before, or pieces that I would really love to wear. I just scored 100$ worth of clothing that would normally cost me 450$ new from PrAna, Patagonia, and Nike! I’m so friggen psyched!!!!",5
2617,"I like it but difficult to find things.: I like the app however they do not provide measurements on jackets which I don’t understand & it is difficult to find general clothes. It seems to be made for searching out specific brands as opposed to types of clothing. For example “Ann Taylor” works, “long dress” does not, unless the word “long” is in the brand name. Poshmark has them beat by a long shot in this area. There is also no option to ask a question.",3
2618,"Proper fit is impossible: Finding pants to fit is impossible due to clothing manufacturers not agreeing on standardized sizes. I wear a size ‘0’ in some brands, a size ‘4’ in others and yet a size ‘6’, ‘8’ or ‘42’ in others. So filtering on my size isn’t possible. 

I tried filtering by my waist measurement but only a handful of options show up. Even then, when looking closer, the results don’t match my request. So I give up.

This is a great site for shirts and comfy clothing but without the ability to try it on before purchasing it’s not so great. Understandably you can return items for ‘free’ if you accept store credit (which I have done) but now I’m stuck trying to find suitable replacements pieces to use up my credit.

I’ll finish my credit here and then go back to shopping for items on sale at Nordstrom’s (free delivery and free returns).",2
2619,"Terrible waste of time: This site is awful! They took my nice cloths, sold only some of them then barley gave me penny’s back! I mean never worn heals I got $0.60 on come in! I had a total of about 6 bucks of “credit” for about 7 items. The items that did not sell I could “reclaim” which they used my “credit” to pay for shipping back to me!!! I choose to ship back because it said they were taking it offline but could sell it later if they want! Really??!!! That site took my cloths made a huge profit and I got nothing but anger. Do not bother with this site or this app!!!!",1
2620,"Fantastic: While I have never sold to ThredUP, my experience as a shopper has been phenomenal. One of my packages was marked as delivered by FedEx but never received. After talking to both companies Thred Up agreed to refund my order in full. I was so disappointed when the clothes didn’t come but so happy with the outcome. I appreciate you and your phenomenal customer service, thredUP.",5
2621,"Used to be great: I’ve been buying on Thredup for years for myself and my kids and used to love it. It used to be the way I could get the best quality for my budget and be green at the same time. It used to be worth paying a premium over other local secondhand and thrift stores because of the selection and because the shipping and returns were free. Now with sneaking in the restocking fees, shipping fees (and increased prices - sometimes more than same item new or new on sale?), I’m done. I loved watching this company grow and thrive but it seems to have lost its way.",1
2622,"Everything I’ve bought has been above my expectations: I have bought several things from ThredUP and every. Single. Time I have gotten my items they have been above my expectations! I just bought some Prada heels for a fraction of retail. They came with the original box, dust bag and care tag! How often do you get that from a thrift shop?!",5
2623,Love ThredUP!: I really do love the convenience of shopping  while on my work break and the selection. The return process is super easy if something doesn’t fit and customer service has never been anything less than amazing. The ONLY reason I didn’t give 5 stars is some of the items are way too pricey.(ie: I saw a shirt that I had seen in the Dollar Tree for like 5 bucks and they had it for 8. ),4
2624,"Great selection and quality.: I have ordered a dozen things from ThreadUp. I've had one thing not fit right, otherwise I've been completely pleased. I returned the item for store credit and happily purchased something else. Several of my favorite pieces in my wardrobe are from ThreadUp!! I love having new items at a fraction of the cost. Thanks ThreadUp!",5
2625,"New update needs update: With the latest update the picture is way too small on the product page. You are forced to enlarge every time if you want a good look. 
Also under product description there is no longer fabric info. I need my fabric info back! Without the ability to see something in person it's hard to tell if it's polyester or rayon or cotton, etc. 
Other than those two things, keep on keeping on ThredUP.",3
2626,"Easy way to browse clothes & build a wardrobe: I really enjoy this app and how easy it makes thrifting for clothes. Using the app, I got free shipping on top of 50% off of my first order which is great. It did take a week for it to be shipped out & I do feel like quite a few items are overpriced.. but otherwise it's a great option for someone like myself who doesn't have easy access to thrift shops.",4
2627,"I love this app: This is a great app to thrift and not spend so much money. While shopping in store is really fun, you don’t always have a thrift store at ur convenience. One thing I would change is the filters. I would add more filters, like sleeve length, back line, accessories, etc. overall, this is a great app",5
2628,"Size labeling is REALLY messed up: I’m a size small with a 25 inch waist and always put the filters for my size up

Shopping can be fun here but you have to be ultra careful 90% of the clothing that the app says in your size is false. I’ve seen pants labeled as a 25 or a 0 have A 32 INCH WAIST I’m not fat! A 25 doesn’t equal a large! Sort your sizes by the actual measurements! 

At least they provide the actual measurements so I can weed the bad options out but it would be better if the labeling of the items and the sorting actually reflects the filters I put on. It’s really hard to find stuff where the labelling is accurate to the measurements 

Please fix this I like shopping here and I think people can easily be mislead by this and get angry.",3
2629,"Love This App: I like thrifting but in person I don’t always find someone. On Threadup I can type exactly what I’m looking for and filter it by size and there’s always something you can even filter by condition and even find new items with tags, it’s so convenient and they have great prices.",5
2630,"App works fine, but…: Overall more measurements should be required, waist measurement for skirts in particular have been a problem because S/M/L does not tell me enough. Also, I have purchased multiple products from different sellers with defects that were not made clear on the listing - saying the product has a minor flaw does not let me know what kind of flaw, torn lace or a strap that’s detached should be clearly noted.",3
2631,Photos: There are some great buys on ThredUp. I didn’t give 5 stars because the photos and descriptions of items are lacking. Photos do not provide a good representation of the items. I feel like it is hit or miss. Some descriptions say fabric details are not available. That makes it even harder if you can not see a good picture of the item.,4
2632,"You NEED this app!!!: Such a great app, you can get a lot from your favorite brands for so much less. It’s a great app, and makes thrif shopping and buying second hand a lot of fun and easy. You can also sell of this app, which is another great feature, and they make it incredibly easy to do. 10/10 would recommend!",5
2633,Reuse fee?? Really?: I guess this isn’t totally app related but when I updated it now they are adding a “circularity fee” to help their reuse efforts. I mean if you want to ask if I want to contribute to this effort that’s one thing but to force it is super uncool. The prices for things for second hand on this site are already a bit high but I overlook it because it’s convenient and they have a great selection but to charge an additional fee? I’m super frustrated. I have a credit on my account and will use that and probably deleted the app.,1
2634,"Almost Excellent: Love the idea of this. Beautiful pieces, environmentally sound...saving waste...etc etc. 

BUT - you can’t search for anything specific. The search feature is horrible. I can’t even type “fur coat” and get accurate results. You have to search by brand and even doing that will result in inaccuracy. Also, some of their clothing is not as described. Please ThredUP, be honest with your customers and let us know if there are missing buttons or sewn up holes in the garments. Honesty will get you much farther. Detailed photos of the clothing will too! 

Aside from that, I love this company and the site. Great deals, awesome app, plus points. 

Watch out! You’ll end up spending more money than you’d like on this site :)",3
2635,"Good for brands, bad for styles: The algorithm makes it easy to find all the items from a specific brands, but not easy to find all the items based on descriptors (Eg, aviator jacket, or high waisted jeans.) Kinda frustrating to be stuck looking through thousands of items to find the few that actually match what you want. Hope they fix in future because I love the idea of buying reclaimed clothes!",3
2636,Gotta love the polka dots!: This is a great app! So many items to choose from and I like that I can get notified when something is no longer in someone else’s cart and that I can save searches and get notified. Makes it super easy to choose used! Clothes arrived quickly and in good condition with cute packaging. Definitely recommend!,5
2637,"Still Waiting...: Here it is months later and I’m still waiting to actually get paid for items sent in MONTHS ago way before the pandemic hit. I used to brag about this site to others but now all I can do is warn them that unless they don’t mind getting paid GARAGE SALE earnings, steer clear of this selling platform. 

Only reason why I’m even still on the app is because it takes forever to actually receive your “pennies on the dollar” earnings.  I’ll be SO relieved once I’m FINALLY able to get paid for all MY fortunate items that seemed to meet their strict standards!🙄",1
2638,"Insanely amazing !!!!: I absolutely love love this app ! Like I’ve never liked ordering clothes online , and because of the virus , I kind of have to ! THIS APP IS AMAZING . This company , the whole idea ! I LOVE ! I got so many items for me and my daughter for $200 ! & WAS PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING , prices are great , clothes are literally name brand , and brand new or basically brand new !
******  I RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE !
***** Especially mommies ❤️🙏🏼🔥 !",5
2639,"Itemized payouts: It has been difficult to keep track of what has been paid out to seller after the sale.  It would be helpful to have the 14 day “countdown” as you have had in the past. How many days until payment would be helpful as well as a already paid out check next to item. With multiple listings, it would be easier to keep track of selling/payment items. 
Thank you",3
2640,Convenient and affordable: I’ve been using thredUP for years now and I really appreciate how I can search for what I want. I appreciate when they have sales. I was most appreciative by how quick they processed my refund. This might be the only way I shop for now on. I can filter my search for Express or Target brands and I find exactly what I want,5
2641,"Hit or miss,Horrible shipping: Sometimes I get great stuff that I love. 
Other times, I get worn out, outdated stuff that is unwearable. This week I got a pair of pants that were very unprofessionally altered with tape and somehow this got through quality control.  Also, shipping is simply HORRIBLE!! 2.5 weeks still waiting for packages to arrive. And this is not free shipping, this is paying for delivery.",5
2642,It’s pretty good: I have sent one big bag they took lots of my items. They commission it’s not that great. But once you sent it in that’s it no more to worry about. It takes about a while to get paid and if you don’t roll it over into more cloths from the shop they take a small % to have it sent to your bank account. Not sure if I want to send in the there 2 huge bags I have.,4
2643,Great way to shop sustainably!: I love this app so much! It’s a great way to shop your favorite brands sustainably. It will take some searching through the website to find items you like but it will be worth it! Not only do they list products that are in good condition but they also provide great pictures. Highly recommend.,5
2644,"Great clothes, amazing prices: So many of my new favorite clothes have been found for a bargain at ThreadUp. And returns are easy when needed. The only suggestion I would have for the app would be to allow me to apply multiple filters to narrow my search. Currently when you use multiple filters, the app grabs every item with ANY of the features and puts it in your feed.",4
2645,"Cool App!: I love shopping at ThredUP, especially on the app. Pretty intuitive and easy to browse. 
The only feedback I have is: in Return section there’s no way to get the FedEx tracking of the return. I have to go to the Web and look it up on the website, which is not always convenient as I use my cellphone more than the laptop. If the devs could add that feature, that would be super helpful!",4
2646,"Amazing!: Love this app! So happy I can shop responsibly second hand! It makes it that much easier that it’s online, so convenient to just order from home. Especially for my kids clothes, they just wear a few times before growing out! Then I can send them back after they don’t fit anymore. Genius app! Love it so much",5
2647,"Not happy!: So I send oodles of clothes to you. I got some credit on my account.  OK, good so far.  Your site sends me suggested items from my search options.  I finally found something I want to buy, and I couldn’t use my credit to make my purchase!  I ended up paying for it, because I didn’t want to loose it.  I’m very frustrated...",5
2648,"Shopping made EASY: This is way easier than sifting through racks at local consignment stores, which are always hit or miss. I love that you can check the measurements, especially the length. I am 5’10 and often have a hard time finding skirts and pants the right length, but on thredUP I can look at the measurements to ensure a perfect fit.",5
2649,Ok: The website is good but the app is meh.  When you’re on the page of an item it won’t let you click the brand which is kind of annoying (feature exists on the webpage). Also you should be able change the parameters of saved searches. Would also be nice to have a tab which contained all new items for saved searches rather than having to click on each saved search,3
2650,"Ethical and Affordable: There are many companies and retailers I can no longer support after learning about their use of child labor, amongst other things and I fully support second hand shopping. After seeing the quality of items and the fair price-- I don't think I'll be shopping anywhere else!",5
2651,Don’t Sell: Thread up is a great online shopping option. I actually prefer this than heading out to the stores. The only thing I wouldn’t recommend would be selling your name brand clothes to thread up.  You will not get a decent amount back. If you’re ok with receiving $1.10 or $2.55 for your brand name items then you’re in luck!,5
2652,"Fun and sustainable.: ThredUP is the fun and sustainable way to shop. I’ve been to their brick and mortar store in my town but was reluctant to also use their online buying. What a surprise! So much to choose from! Just received my first Goody Box today and I’m buying 4/10 items. All great brands (JCrew, Athleta, Eileen Fisher) for a fraction of the price. I have also committed to removing 2 items from my closet every time I buy one new item. Thanks ThredUP!",4
2653,"They need improvement!: While the idea of sending unwanted clothes to a place that will sell it for you is a great idea, this company needs some improvement.  I have had no response to most of my communication with them.  Their Chat goes nowhere, and I can’t find any other link to contact them. 
I have found my first selling experience with them to be my last one.  The “profit” expected turned out to be far far less then what I could have made in Ebay or local consignment shops. 

This selling company may fit the needs of others, but not mine.",1
2654,"Has become a scam: I’ve sent several bags of clothing over the last 4 years. The quality of what I’m sending has gone up, but the payouts have gone down. They took over a month to process the last bag I sent, and they mistakenly processed it as a donation bag. This particular bag had several high end items. I apparently have no recourse because I didn’t itemize the bag before sending, so the tax receipt they emailed does me no good. 

I’m especially annoyed that items I’ve sent have been rejected, yet I’ve ordered items and received them in poor condition. 

Go elsewhere.",1
2655,"Love the app!: I have been using ThredUP for almost a year. I love the site and app. It's easy to search and filter to narrow down your choices. Items stay in your cart for a while, and a notification is sent if your cart is expiring. I also sell clothes and earn credit to buy more clothes. Highly recommend this app!",5
2656,"Loved it at first, now it’s ok...prices to high for secondhand items: I enjoyed my initial experience with ThredUP. I have been a customer on the purchasing end as well as on the consignment and selling end. In my opinion, the two don’t correlate. I receive $1 or less for an item, same name brand and sometimes in better condition, and pay 16x’s more for an equivalent item. It’s getting too pricey and not worth me purchasing unless I am looking for something specific. Hope it changes and I might purchase again.",2
2657,"Keeps asking me to update, there’s no new updates available: The app keeps telling me to update, there’s no new updates available when I check the App Store. I can’t use the app since the pop takes me to App Store to look for updates!! Super annoying bug!",5
2658,"Best of the BEST!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: Being a single mom of three, this is the best app I have found to keep all four of us prayed a quality clothing and quick shipping!!!! 
My favorite part is after your questionnaire at the beginning. It takes your sizes and only shows you the sizes that fit you!!!!!!!!",5
2659,"So happy!: I ordered 3 sweaters/tops + a pair of jeans and they all look like the photos and are exactly as described. I got all of that for about $45 which is a great deal considering most jeans are now $60. None of the things I ordered were from SHEIN either, and the quality of the clothes are great! Will be ordering again.",5
2660,"Fabulous!!: An a acquaintance turned me on to ThredUP and let me say this…I’m so happy she did!!!! It’s a fabulous place to shop! Everything I have bought has been great quality. The prices are very reasonable. Lots of name brands, too. Returns are easy, too. I just did my first return & it’s so simple. Great place to shop. Thanks ThredUP!!!",5
2661,"Love this shopping experience: I have been relying on this site for years now. I don’t have any department stores in my Northern Michigan location so Thread-up fills a big gap! My only suggestion is that the bust measurements be more consistent, I have learned not to rely on them as they are often not accurate 😁",5
2662,"Love the concept app is a bit glitchy: Really love this app and have had a great experience ordering from thred up. The app however is glitchy and for weeks at a time my sort by button doesn’t work. I click to sort by relevance, newest, or recently discounted and it’s all the same nothing changes. So I get bored and leave the app.",4
2663,Love the impact: I feel great buying used and even better seeing the how the App shows the impact of buying used instead of new. Love love it. Also love how you can get free shipping when you purchase a certain amount. I think its a fair amount. I had about 18 tops purchased with free shipping! All used☺️❤️🌍🌳,5
2664,"Inaccurate descriptions and overpriced: A lot of the pieces offered are past season or worn but they are priced as if they are from current season. Majority of the time these pieces aren’t even sold in stores anymore, that’s how old they are. Which is fine, I understand it’s a secondhand online store, but at least let the price reflect that. Also, pieces are listed as “like new” but have wear so should be listed as “gently used”.",3
2665,"Is not cohesive with the on-line site: So when I shop at ThredUP. Com I get free shipping, but not on the App. My saved items are not the same on the app and on-line. Wish when you log into your account it took both in consideration. Maybe there is a way and I am not it correctly?",5
2666,"BuyerBeware: Ordered a Large Lucky sweatshirt. When it finally was delivered, which was a week and half later than expected, the large was so small it could only fit my 25 pound dog. Went to return- Final Sale, no dice.
My dog now has a new sweatshirt.
Buyer Beware-If it looks to good to be true, it probably is.
Tradesy from now on for me.",5
2667,Difficult Checkout: My card kept getting rejected so I had to re-enter the information several times. I actually had 2 items drop off my order but didn’t have the patience to go back and look for them. You lost sales.,5
2668,"Great app!: I love this app and the advantages of it. I’ve spent the same amount on a few items as I have on one item in a store so it works out way better, however my most recent order is still not to me and it says delivered. I can’t wait a way to talk to anyone. If someone can respond and tell me how to handle that please and thank you :)",4
2669,A must!: ThredUP has changed the way I shop. Everything I get is in great condition and far cheaper than stores or stitch fix. I’m slowly replacing my entire wardrobe while being eco friendly too. They even have kits they mail you to send in gently used clothes to sell. It’s a great company!,5
2670,Great Stuff but Horrible Shipping: Placed a single order and it’s being shipped in multiple deliveries from all over the country. All SmartPost which means I have to drive to go get my packages. If they ever arrive. Tracking shows one for delivery today and there is nothing. Some are as far out as end of the week. Not convenient if I still have to drive as far as the store is to get my package. And to have to do it multiple days in a row is just ridiculous.,2
2671,"Good…but…: Good variety, easy search.  GREAT ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Descriptions sometime incorrect, but no restocking fee for incorrect description.  Gave 3 because of that and restocking fee high percentage wise for lower priced items.  Returns easy and quick credit.  Love promo codes for discounts and free shipping!!!

Very specific search tool is awesome.  Have not yet, but going to submit clothes to sell.  Vulvar cancer requiring more permanent wardrobe change so will use again.",3
2672,"Super !: Love the shopping and always find what I look for. I do have one request, would it be Possible to write a few descriptions to some of those items. Exp. Jackets, for which level of cold are they.
This like that, nothing to crazy . 
Keep it going , that way I get cloth I love and pay for.",5
2673,"Awesome site to buy from: Much easier than driving all over town. You have to get use to shopping online and know your sizes. I have done well buying, not well selling to thread up, they got me once real good but I have continued to buy.  Been buying for ages from them.",5
2674,"Get to know the definitions: This app is great for buying used items at a great price, but you need to know the definitions of the clothing you’re not going to be disappointed.  If things say “minor wear on clothing” there could be piling and other wear that you were not expecting. But for the most part I have had a great experience buying used clothes.",4
2675,"Lost clothes and money.: I sent a bag and a box full of clothes and shoes before the end of 2020.  It is now April 2021 and none of my items have been listed, there has been no commutations on my items.  I’m starting to feel like I was scammed   I sent name brand things, most have never been worn.",5
2676,"Didn’t get what I ordered: I was so excited to order things from thredUP after referred by my favorite podcast. I ordered a tank that I thought was super cute and it took forever to get to my house and then it wasn’t even the shirt I had ordered. It had extra straps, the wrong neckline, and was a completely different color. I hated that shirt, it wasn’t what I ordered, and I still had to pay for it because of the restocking fee! After using my store credit from my return after my first order, I won’t order again.",1
2677,"Such a disappointment: I just got a box of clothes 3 out of the 6 items had holes in them! Such a bummer! Overall my experience has been meh, at best. Coupon codes never work. I had a $10 credit and used it on a shirt. The order was canceled by the company (sounds like they double sold it or
could not find it in their inventory)and I asked for my credit back and have yet to get it. The Thredup a few years back was much better. Poor customer care and even worse products.",1
2678,"Almost Perfect: I love this app so much, I seriously spend way too much of my time on it. The only issue I have is that there are some things they stopped letting you filter and search for such as designer handbags or accessories. They have also almost completely gotten rid of the their jewelry section which I really enjoyed before and was actually the reason I signed up.",4
2679,"Review pros and cons: Pros: Selection is great. Customer support is good and response is decent. Pricing excellent. 

Cons: Searching items for tall and they’ve got inseam of 30” in that search. That is not tall, and is very frustrating when I am looking for a 33” inseam. I’ve lost points when i can cancel an order twice now. (Example would be ten bucks off order) Getting credits on account has taken longer than norm.",3
2680,"AWESOME APP!!!!!!!: great prices and descriptions of merchandise. Always 100% authentic! I love the new feature where you can bid on things it allows you to get a MUCH LOWER PRICE!!!! The only thing that I wish thread up would do is add pictures of the inside of wallets and handbags. I do not like how I can’t see how much wear is inside of them, but other than that I am 100% in love with thread up!!!",5
2681,Love love love!: This is my new obsession! I constantly get compliments on my closet and clothes!! And it’s got a lot to do with THREDUP! I can’t express how much this app is my best friend when u need a quick colorful pick me up or a whole new wardrobe! I love that I can get jeans that fit in my length as I’m 5’10” and wear a34-36 inch length.  So I’m always guaranteed to find something with thred up. Thank you thred you!,4
2682,"The biggest regret: I sent about 7/8 bags you have lost so many of my cloths (Brand new with tags or someone in your staff is keeping them) I try to reclaim some of them back and AGAIN YOU THAT ORDER . So
For anyone that wants to read a review I say think twice don’t even bother brand new jacket brand new blazers Randy skirts they had tags I was getting $.40 wow they’re getting 15 $20 not worth your time you might as well give them to a shelter because you are going to get hardly anything from this. At least you can clean your donation at the end of the year",1
2683,"Streamlined shopping: This app is my first and last stop when I need clothes. I can buy secondhand, search for exactly what I need, browse and compare a thousand items, and keep a running wishlist. The deals, sales and free shipping keep my wardrobe refreshed with unique, quality fashion. I rarely go anywhere else.  Fun and user-friendly shopping experiences!",5
2684,"One of my favorite sites..: So far everything I ordered was as described in the picture.. the only thing I don’t like is the size guidelines.. I’m not sure if what I ordered will fit especially the pants.. so far only one pants I ordered was bigger than I thought.. but so far so good. 
The prices are are really good especially when they have a sale.",5
2685,Very hard to deal with - no customer service: I’ve sent 5 clean out bags and I get no credits. My app would not update bags. I tried to go online and get a new password and get sent to the app. I tried to go on the app multiple times to get customer chat and it’s unavailable. I tried to change the prices on my clothing and get sent to the app. Well my app wouldn’t update and I can’t fix this. Thousands of dollars of clothes I sent! No credits. I should have took the time and went on the many other sites. Thred up can at least send me a donation receipt !!!!!!!!,1
2686,"Forever changed how I shop: I first found ThredUP when I was searching for a way to purge my closet without having to sell the nicer pieces myself. That first clean out kit led me to discover other beautiful gently used and brand-new pieces that came in well below my budget! I vowed to only buy used this year, and ThredUP is making that an easy resolution to keep!",5
2687,"No more retail for me: I have recently discovered this site. I buy my clothing from select stores so I am pretty confident of sizing when ordering online. This site lists the EXACT  items  I purchased full price. 

Do not hesitate to order. I narrow my searches to brand new or just like new .....when I received my items they did not disappoint",5
2688,"I love the items I have purchased!!!: I have to say, I tend to be the shopper that looks for new items, but the intrigue of quality, used items was there! Every item I have picked from ThredUP so far has been packaged nicely, had good quality, and I am excited to add them to my wardrobe. A+ for quality, service, and benefit to the environment!!",5
2689,"Many positives... but Inaccurate condition descriptions: Super excited at first with this site. LOVE the second hand concept and processes (easy returns, etc). My only disappointment is clothes that are described as being in excellent condition are usually not. Two items had holes in them and most just had obvious signs of wear, which would be fine if they would be described as such. I hope leadership fixes this misinformation issue, and I’ll be a customer for life.",3
2690,"Terrible for sellers: Just bad. Bags take forever to process. You get next to nothing back. If you change the price of your items, it immediately bumps you down a reimbursement %, even if the item should be in a higher block. I finally decided to cash everything out and their cash out calculations basically steal your money. I had to make 2 transactions because somehow I had balances left even though I typed in the full amount they showed available. Transaction fees steal the $$ and now the balance left is too small to transfer.",1
2691,"Super Thrift Store: My experience with ThredUP Up has been exceptional!  Pricing for Designer items is superb.  The app is very easy to use.  Love that I can “save” favorite items and watch the pricing on them.  Shipping is quick as well.  Sometimes items in my saved areas don’t show up, but this could be a glitch.  Overall, really great experience",5
2692,ThredUP: I got 4 coats for my 2 grandchildren and one of the coats I only gave $1.99 and I feel it was the best one of them all and it was worth way more than whatI paid!!! I absolutely love this site and I will be shopping for their clothes on here for sure!!!! Thank you ThredUP for being awesome and affordable 5 stars I would give you 10 stars if I could ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️!!!!,5
2693,Expensive: Let me just say that the clothes here are literally priced if not the same more expensive than actual price not sure if they price the items on orig. price of item but most of these brands always have sales and their clothes are like %50 percent off already so they should base the prices on the actual selling price. The only thing worth buying on here may be those really expensive brands like Gucci and stuff but not old navy or justice for girls. It’s a well set up app very organized and stuff but unfortunately won’t be buying from here.,1
2694,I Love Thrift Shopping: There are so many ways I enjoy shopping with this company!!  ThredUP always has my favorite brands. I am always finding bargains.  I love being able to narrow my search in order to speed up my shopping experience. Recycling by purchasing secondhand helps to reduce my carbon footprint!  Returns are easy!! You can’t go wrong shopping with ThredUP.,5
2695,"My Go-To Site For Dress Clothes!: Im a nurse and I have lots of scrubs, but hardly any dress clothes. When I order clothes, I know they are in good condition and affordable. And if they don’t fit, I just send them back!  And it’s a great opportunity to clean out my closet. I’m never going to wear that dress that I bought for that cruise again.  Why hang onto it when someone else can wear it?",5
2696,"Easy to use, becoming more expensive: The app is super easy to navigate. Tradesy has quality pieces and a large selection. Love that you can filter by size as well as condition. Only issue is with the $1.99 per piece to return and you lose an additional $8.99 if you want money back instead of Tradesy credit. This wasn’t always the case. Makes buying online more of a risk.",4
2697,"Thred Up is Great!: I have been using Thred Up for months and they have received great, like new or new with tags clothes, shoes and accessories. I have not been disappointed with anything I have bought due to quality. I have returned items due to poor fitting and the return process has been easy and quick. Highly recommend ThredUp!",5
2698,"Love it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️: I’m also giving this app 5 hearts.  I love this app so much that I thought my husband may take away my credit card.  He noticed the numerous seemingly new, and sometime are new, name brand outfits appearing on me and in my closet.  I pointed out that I am able to put together multiple designer outfits fits for less than the price of groceries. He was amazed.",5
2699,"Works For Me!: I'm so glad I took my friends advice and tried this. I found a beautiful dress for my high school reunion in and have been able to find other cute dresses for certain occasions.
I've taken advantage of their return policy in giving myself credit because I turn right back around and buy something else.",5
2700,Good but…: Where did the “items similar to this” section go? I get tired of scrolling and thrifting through a bunch of junk before I find something I really like and sometimes it sells and I have to go on another hunt to find something similar. Bring it back please.,5
2701,"Why do I have to sign in every time??: I love Thred Up and I’d love to be able to scroll while I’m laying down and comfy not on my computer. However, every time I open the app, I have to sign in with my email and input my password. Even though I have stored my password in my phone, it keeps asking me to type it in. Honestly, most of the time I just close the app because yes, I am that lazy. I don’t like this app.",3
2702,It’s a hidden gem: I first saw thredup on tv as an ad. I love thrifting and when I heard that I can thrift online I was thrilled. This app has helped me find so many beautiful and unique pieces.  I love how you can sort and filter to find exactly what your looking for. I will always be shopping here :). Would recommend!,5
2703,"Pockets option: The only thing that I can think of to improve the app is…

You guessed it, a filter for pockets. 

Sometimes it’s difficult to tell if an item has usable pockets from the photos. So, having a filter option would completely help.",5
2704,Happy: Great site I have sold and bought from them. The only thing is the delivery it charges all the time gives you one date and then you go check on your order it gives a different date BUT other then that I like it,5
2705,Making returns is super difficult: The shopping experience overall is great!! I can be BIG upset in other Thread up is that they make returns difficult and expensive for the shopper. It used to be you could use your VIT points to make returns. 200 points = a free return. Now they make it 400= a free return. Meaning you have to buy upwards of $400 dollars of merchandise just to return a $10 item that doesn’t fit correctly. Please change this back to a fair return.,2
2706,"Something changed with filtering?: Maybe I’m doing something wrong because I don’t see anyone else mentioning this in reviews, but the filtering doesn’t work in the app any more. I’ll enter a filter constraint like an inseam length, and it will just continue to show me everything. It’s frustrating because I have really short legs and I actually enjoy shopping through thred up more than other retailers because you can rarely filter pants for length.",2
2707,"Processing times need to be addressed: I used to sell every item I would send in to ThredUo very quickly so this was a good opportunity for both seller and ThredUo. The kit that was received in June this year did not get processed until October. The items were for summer so they did not sell well and I had to reclaim 80% of my items. This has never happened before.
I have another kit that has been waiting to be processed for 3 months - will be dealing with the same problems. Might need to find another resale site.",1
2708,The Awesomeness of ThredUP: I only have glowing things to say about ThreadUp! The prices? So amazing that I cannot say enough good things! Designer pieces at low low prices! So many things to choose from my orders were HUGE! And I didn’t spend very much money either! I am a devoted customer forever. I am addicted I think!,5
2709,"Long shipping: It’s a great store and I love how many items they have.
Shipping unfortunately takes forever. They have to first collect all the items and ship them to a singular warehouse from where they then can be shipped to you.
It took around 2.5 weeks to get here. (Still waiting for my order but it’s on the way.) So be prepared.",4
2710,"Smart shopping!: I love the mission of ThredUP and also how it saves me time and money. I can search for exactly what I need — the cut, material, pattern, etc and boom 💥 so many options! The measurements are helpful and accurate which helps the shopping experience not be so much of a guessing game. And I love that it’s helping to reduce-reuse-recycle. 💚",5
2711,"My “go to” place: Since I found this place, I’ve deleted all the other shopping apps in my phone. I can buy 5-7 pairs of signature jeans here for the price of 1 pair somewhere else. All my work clothes? I buy them all here. Some pieces are a miss, but most of my purchases are a perfect fit.",5
2712,"Worst Customer Service!: I wish I could say that I love ThreadUp but I can’t. The items that I’ve received from them has been great but their Customer Service or shall I say lack of is awful! Not only can you not speak with a human but you can’t even do an online chat to fix a problem. I’ve spent several hours today and still can’t get my issues resolved. 
I will be closing my account and deleting their App as soon as my item’s come in because I can’t even get through to cancel items!",1
2713,"Convenient, lovely and earth friendly: ThredUP is my go to for online shopping. I love that I can send in clothes, the clothes I buy are second hand and they donate anything that isn’t suitable for redistribution. ❤️❤️❤️Keep it up guys! I hope more people find this app and start sharing their clothes.👍🏽",5
2714,Shipping take forever: I chose to order my dress pants on here instead of on Poshmark and that was a mistake. The only shipping option said that it would be delivered a week after purchase and it’s been almost two weeks. I eventually thought that my package was lost and I called USPS just to find out that instead the shipping option that was given takes 6-8 WEEKS for shipping. They said I would be lucky to get my package 10 days after. Really wish I would’ve known before I ordered these.,1
2715,Brilliant app: I love this app so much! It’s a great idea and so far customer service has been awesome. My items arrived quickly… they don’t mention there is a processing fee for returns and restocking fee… so heads up there.  The only other thing that I would LOVE TO SEE… is a 3rd pic!!!  Front and back don’t always show you everything and 45 degree look would be great!,4
2716,"I love it!: I don’t ever write reviews but I recently had my 3rd child and felt so defeated when I had to get rid of all of my clothes, living off of my husbands shirts and leggings killed my self esteem, but since I found Thred Up I have been able to restock my closet for hardly any cost! I’m so happy that I found Thred Up! 🥰",5
2717,"ThredUp is addictive!: You’ll have so much fun, cavorting through the thousands of offerings, using the filters to narrow the choices to fit your personal style. My  favorite activity is entering random page numbers, just to see what tempting goodies can be found there. There are, indeed, endless possibilities; but -you are forewarned- this treasure trove of bargains is addictive!",5
2718,"ThredUP is a game-changer!: After having kids, I wasn’t sure I’d ever enjoy shopping again. But, ThredUP’s Goody boxes allows me to pick 10 of my favorites just about every month. I can try items on at my leisure and in the comfort of my own home. I keep what I want and return what I don’t. I so look forward to seeing that polka dot box on my doorstep!",5
2719,App needs work: I love the idea behind this as well as the quality of clothes I get at reduced prices.  The only downfall is the App.  I keep trying to get my clean out bag and I constantly get the  “oops something went wrong” verbiage across the screen.  I would send in way more stuff but the app and the website have a hard time processing that request for whatever reason.,4
2720,"As a “seller”...: I have been having a hard time getting the information I need from a seller stand point and haven’t had anyone get back to me from customer service about one of my items with the wrong information. This platform is definitely for buyers, but I would say not so much for sellers.",5
2721,Not Worth your Buck: So I went into detail with this app. If you were to chose to sell your stuff on this app you would only get 1-5$ for a GOOD piece of clothing maybe even less. But when they mark it up it is worth almost 15-20 times more on their app. Ripping the  seller off. Not just that but they overcharge their items. You can purchase some of the items on here for the the same price sometimes even cheaper and New directly from the store. Not counting the additional shipping costs for this website. Don’t waste your time with this app!,1
2722,"Great app,love the clothes: Sometimes things take too long to arrive.  And it’s hard to predict how long it will take.  Even if 2 or more items are coming from the same place...they can arrive at widely different times.  

Also, I’d appreciate better comments on what materials items are made if and more discription on flaws.  And more pictures of each item.",4
2723,Customer Service is Not Helpful: So disappointed with thredUP’s customer service! I contacted them via the chat for help researching why my package had not moved from the FedEx SLC shipping location in the last 6 days. I was told by Matt to look on the tracking info for updated info. REALLY???  That’s exactly how I found that the item was in SLC & had been there for the last 6 days. Such a waste of my time contacting thredUP & so very frustrating. These reps need to be trained in customer service and to actually research the customers issue before responding with a ridiculous answer!,1
2724,The only way I shop: I recommend ThredUP to everyone I know. I always get so many compliments on my outfits! ThredUP has so many different options available for any occasion and budget. I find so many unique pieces that I honestly can’t believe I own them!! With such a diverse inventory you will always find something to spice up your wardrobe!,5
2725,"Would Never Sell Again: My purchasing experience was positive.  However, I tried selling and was disappointed by the payout structure and found it odd that the two items “not accepted” were my more expensive brand jeans (Joe’s Jeans & Mavi).  Next time I’ll stick with selling my items myself on Poshmark.  While I have to put more effort in, the payoff is 4x what I would get thru ThredUP. I’d rather donate all my clothes than sell to ThredUP again.  I’m hoping I get at least something for the items of mine they have now.",2
2726,"Don’t believe the high ratings: Boy, do I feel angry about this service. I feel super scammed. I sent about $1000 in brand new (tags on) clothes I got from Target & H&M that were bought within the past year.

U have the option to get items that aren’t approved sent back to u. I thought, they would at least take every single one of the brand new tags-on items. So I thought it would be ok to not deal w: getting the rest back. NOPE. They only put 10 items up for sale out of at least several hundred items sent to them. Got $20 for what DID sell, & they kept the ones that didn’t sell to be resold (if I didn’t claim within 13 days)

I WILL NEVER EVER USE THIS SERVICE, AGAIN!

If I had taken a grocery bag of my clothes on a shopping trip to h&M, I would have received 20% off from their recycling program, which PAYS ME MORE than ThredUp did.

What a waste of time and A LOT of money.
BEWARE!!!",1
2727,"Love my Thredup App: Super easy to use. The search feature is great and allows me to see quickly what’s new in the name brands I’m interested in. I have basically changed out most of my tired old wardrobe over the past year with some awesome unique pieces as well as some much needed basic pieces. 
Thank you ThredUp for being so user friendly!

2728,"Great place to get clothes: Prices have gone up recently which I think they are trying to smooth over by offering discounts. Still, it is possible to find really great things at good prices. I like it because I can wear cashmere, silk, and designer items at a much reduced price. Everything comes as advertised,it’s a fun way to shop!",5
2729,"DO NOT SELL...total rip off.: If you sell on this site, you’re 1000% getting ripped off. It doesn’t make any sense how little they give you for your items (think less than $1 for brand new items) and then they turn around and sell it for exponentially more on their site. Of course, no one is forced to send things to them to sell so I guess it’s the seller’s “fault” for partaking but it just seems very shady and crappy of them. Don’t want to support a company like that. Go to Poshmark or Mercari. You are in waaaaay more control of how much you make you will make A LOT more!",1
2730,"High prices and return fees: Prices have skyrocketed! Who wants to pay $10 or more for used leggings??? And now there's a fee for ""restocking"" returned items?! It's difficult to buy online because you can't touch and see the item like you would in a store. Sometimes items aren't what you thought. So you have to pay a fee if you're returning something?? Definitely not going to buy through ThredUP as often as I used to!",3
2731,"Wrong, wrong, wrong!: I purchased a really cute Womens size 12 dress. When it arrived it was way, way, way too small - perhaps a girls size 12? I know my size. 
I returned it with a note of complaint, but was still charged return shipping and a restocking fee. Thred up made money on their mistake and I ended up dissatisfied and afraid to order from them again.",5
2732,"You should download. For sure.: Great app, great clothes, great company. 

Only one minor suggestion: ability to filter my own favorites list. Sometimes I am ready to buy a specific item and scrolling to find it is annoying. Or I am wanting to look at all the shoes I have favorited. So filter my favorites. Request.

love love love the app otherwise.",5
2733,"Love to buy not a fan to sell too: I love buying from here especially for off season clothing. We live in FL and travel to colder climates that we don’t buy clothing regularly for. 
Selling I have not been a fan of lately. I fell like I use to get decent prices for the ease of selling to them but my last few bags have been not worth it and way under paid so I have stopped using them to sell to.",4
2734,"Great!: I’m always very Leary about buying clothes these online. Different sizes for different manufacturers etc... But, guess what? Every piece I have purchased is perfect.,💃💃
Fits well and looks great. I lost 50 lbs last yr and like close to fit my to show off my new body but not too much. And $$$$& is on the mark. Very reasonable. Hood quality. I’ll be back.
Thank you.",5
2735,"Convenient, but disappointing sometimes: I ordered 3 sweaters. 2 of them came, and the order form had the third one crossed out, with the word “refunded” written next to it in pencil. I wish I would have known that it wasn’t coming so I could have ordered a different sweater instead. I don’t want to place another order and have to pay for more shipping. However, the order was packaged nicely and the sweaters that did come were nice. I am placing another order and hoping that it all comes this time.",2
2736,"Love it! Great for buying and clean-out: The ultimate thrift store. Quality Ratings and measurements are consistently accurate. I have to restrain myself from buying more and cluttering my closet!

If you’re looking to make money on high end items, you may be happier with eBay. Other posters seem unhappy with their payouts. But if you are cleaning your closet, the clean out kit is a godsend.",5
2737,"Great but use caution: The ap is easy to navigate and very user friendly. Items are screened well for quality. I like using the ap and am happy with most of my items. However, customer service is extremely poor. I’ve have an item processing for over two weeks and can’t get a return response on its status. They really need to improve response time.",4
2738,"MR: I don't like to spend a lot of money on clothes.  I love having the option of buying used clothing to keep costs down.  I also like that I can send in my used items to get some money back.  My only frustration is that I wish they would give more details for each item:  does it have pockets, is it waterproof,  fully or partially lined.  I like to know what I am buying.  I need details.",4
2739,"Read reviews-Learn From My Mistake: I sent in a bag with some of the items still having tags.  It took 2 months to process the bag.  They ""accepted"" 8 of my items none of which were the new with tag items.
They sold all 8 items for about $89 total.  My account shows a payout of $8.33 but of course I didn't get that.  My available cash out is $1.34 If I cash out with a transfer to PayPal, when all is said and done I would end up with $1.31!  So basically they paid me less than 1.5% of what my items sold for!  Do not waste your time with these people!!!!!",1
2740,"I buy most of my clothes here…: I love the “my sizes” settings, I love how you can sort by brand AND fabric! I’ve certainly found a lot of gems this way. Knowing how resource and labor-intensive the clothing manufacturing process is, I’m so glad there’s such a helpful site to reuse and recycle clothes with such a huge selection.",5
2741,"No measurements listed, sneaky policy, terrible search features: They need to include exact sizing measurements in item descriptions but they do not do that. Then when you get an item that doesn’t fit they tell you it’s returnable but neglect to say they are going to charge you $11 for a shipping label out of the refund. The search feature is terrible and seldom provides anything remotely similar to what you are looking for. It also does not save “saved sizes” so you have to re enter them every time you search.",1
2742,The percentage: I think that the percentage that they take is too high. They don’t send a massage once it’s ready to sale. Once the sale start it should send a notification on the time limit you have to change the prices if you want. Because you can change them but only after so many days after processing is complete. I’m looking for a better way to sale and still make good money for my items.,2
2743,"Misinformed customer service: the app and I noticed when I placed the order the address change did not update . 

I contacted thredUP right away on the day the order was placed  via email and chat service regarding the address change via email & thredUP never responded to my emails from last week. 

I contacted chat with a response that as long as I changed my address via USPS it should be fine … thred up reassured me there was nothing to worry about. this info was also in the website .

I have changed my address via USPS however the package via fedex which will mean it wouldn’t matter as usps address changes won’t effect fedex packages . 

The app made a mistake and customer service is no help - there is no number to call and chat service gave me misinformation / no number to call 

I want my money back.",1
2744,"It’s love/hate: I don’t want to be apart of fast fashion or the abuses of the clothing industry. However my kids and I need clothes. It’s a lot of work to figure out the many coupon codes to find the best deal. I know that something I order will be totally shrunken, torn or totally not what I expected like the jeans that were marked straight fit but we’re clearly skinny . The refund never pays for the shipping so I end up paying again to replace the things that don’t work out.",2
2745,"Train Wreck: This company is a train wreck. As a seller, it’s unacceptable to wait 6 months for a clean out bag to be processed, have 3/4 of the bag lost or not posted for sale and then receive emails for items to be reclaimed that were never posted for sale to begin with. It took me over 3 weeks just to be able to reclaim 1 item that was never posted. I will NEVER do business with this company again and I will be posting a review on every  review site I can find. I would give them a rating of minus 10 if I could.",1
2746,Addictive: Now 80% of my wardrobe is thrifted things to throw it up. You find such great prices for such great quality depending on what you want to find. I think it’s honestly the best way to shop instead of going to big companies and definitely you can be watching your carbon footprint.,5
2747,"Gone downhill: Shopping on this app has become so difficult compared to what it used to be, and it makes me sad. It seems like at least half of the inventory is final sale these  days, which is a bummer for ordering clothing online.   For items you can actually return, they’ve increased their restocking fee by 99%, and you are limited to waiving the fee for only three items, despite your reward points.  I get that there is a business to this, but it used to be so much better.",1
2748,"Disappointed in recent change: I am a long time user of the app and have enjoyed it up until recently. About a month ago, the restocking fee per item jumped from $1.99 to $3.99, and it requires 2x the reward points to waive restocking fees. Thredup did not notify customers of this change to my knowledge.

It’s a dramatic increase and one that will discourage me from buying from this app again.",3
2749,"BBB: I have sent in 2 bags of very nice items, 7 months ago. ThredUP just keeps saying they are too busy to get them listed…. I saw there are so many other people complaining about the same issue. The BBB rating also reflects this issue. All complaints on there are because of no listing of their items. Some complaints are because customers service NEVER RESPONDS!

If ThredUP, is this busy, they need to post Full Disclosure to customers up front, that any Mdse sent in will take 7+ months or more to be listed for sale.",1
2750,Yessss: I love to thrift my clothes but don’t have a good place anywhere close. This app allows me to buy without having to go in and sort through stuff. Products can be sorted my specific measurements. Fast shipping. Can’t wait to try clearing out my closet with them so I have room for more.,5
2751,"Shopping is fun again :): Thredup is beyond impressive from the wide variety of clothing to the prices that are just amazing. Additionally, they have fast shipping, cute packaging, and they are really doing their part to cut emissions. Shopping is fun again and the excellence is in the actions/service they provide. Keep up the awesome work!",5
2752,"My only complaint: Love thredUP! My only complaint is measurements. I tend to look at the numbers, but frankly they are all over the place. How can a size large women’s blouse be 24 inches in the chest? I usually look at how it looks on the model, and then decide that the measurements are in error and order anyway. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. ☹️",4
2753,"Gift certificates: I love shopping on ThredUP, but maybe I’m stupid or something but I cannot find where to enter the gift certificate number to pay for my bundle. I contacted the help center and they gave me instructions.  But I can’t, for the life of me figure it out. You’d think they would make it easier.",5
2754,"Obsessed: I love ThreadUp. 

I’ve been a customer for 4 years and have bought clothes for myself and my two kids (0 and 2 yrs) on the app and am so impressed! Reasons below:

1) They are a tech-powered eco-friendly shopping option. I try to reduce my family’s carbon footprint as much as possible. ThreadUp makes it easy.

2) Excellent customer service. I chatted with an agent who helped me merge two accounts and settle issues with an order - hassle free!

3) Great inventory. I’m picky and I don’t need to change my standards through ThreadUp. They offer great options for work, events, and kids! 

Thanks ThreadUp!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",5
2755,"Best women’s site ever!: Live Thread up. Recommended them to all my girlfriends. Great prices in all sorts of items. From economical budget items to high end designer items. Ordering is easy. Returns are easy. Live how they notify you when your favorite items drop in price. I’d recommend them to EVERYONE! Clothes, shoes, boots, purses!!!!!",5
2756,"Usually ok: Customer service it’s really fast . I’ve always being happy with my orders in the past . Lately, I had a couple item that seemed to had being overlooked by quality check - I paid 16 dollars for a Lacoste shirt plus 8 dollars shipping just to find out that it was stained - the hassle of the return if not even worth all the aggravation - but usually decent  quality items.",3
2757,"New delivery method not good!: I ordered eight items on August 21st and was told after my order went through, not before as an option, that they are now using a “new way” to ship by consolidating orders with multiple items from different warehouses to arrive in 1 package. I don't care if i get multiple packages, as it has been done in the past. They also stated it would take 12 MORE days to receive the order. Also, my card has been charged for items that have not been shipped!",1
2758,LOVE: I’m addicted!  I order something at least once a week. I would say 80% of my wardrobe is from here!! I have bought everything from NorthFace jackets to Sam Edelman heels and everything in between. Returns are easy and I also love the rewards points. My favorite app and favorite place to shop!!,5
2759,"They steal your clothes you send them: I paid extra for them to send me back my clothes they did not accept to sell. And they said I didn’t choose that option (when I did) and now my clothes are gone. I hate these guys. I pretty much paid money to them and gave them free clothes. I’m no longer buying for selling to them. They are thieves, and you get nothing for selling your clothes through them anyway.  They are ripping you off and profiting off of it. Shady company. Do not recommend.",1
2760,"Great deals, huge selection, love it: I save searches on my favorite brands and check them daily. I find amazing high end brands that I wouldn’t pay full price for. And I love using the app. I save favorite items that I just can’t pull the trigger on but watch for them to be part of a sale. And I love getting Gymboree clothes for my kids.",5
2761,Love it!: i love using thread up! It’s so functional because clothes that are a little to no different are so much more cheaper on thread up rather than buying something brand new for more expensive. I recently ordered a red polo from thread up that was originally $55 but we bought it for $15!,5
2762,"The Absolute Best: I love ThredUP so much, they have the best prices for all brands including designer. The sales and point system is awesome too. I have also had a great experience with customer service. They really care about you and love to help. I can see using this shopping service for a long time, and if I could give it ten stars I would! ❤️ Thanks ThredUP!",5
2763,"I’m addicted: Even if you’re not looking for a new addiction, this app is still a necessity. All the best one of a kind finds right next to your favorite brands and all at prices you absolutely can’t argue with. The sales are the best and the shipping is even better. Buy & Bundle is literally my best friend when I’m being indecisive between stellar steels and priceless pieces.",5
2764,"Amazing variety!: I love thredUP!! Over the past 2 years I’ve purchased around 70 items (mostly clothing) and have kept about 80% (some weren’t returnable but if the price is low enough it’s worth the risk). Some brand new, some barely worn for up to 90% off!! They regularly offer promo codes so look for those. I couldn’t be happier 😊",5
2765,"Worried: So I have placed two orders with thred up and they are really dragging there feet I ordered over a week ago and just got notified my first order shipped. I really wish I would have read the reviews before because it sounds like there is huge customer service problems and major product problems. I am hoping my order come as it looked, not fake and in the shape they say. I have the filling I’m going to regret this and be out $250.",3
2766,"Done with ThredUP: I used to enjoy shopping at ThredUP but recently have noticed a lot of mistakes on the item descriptions from clearly wrong colors to items in blatantly wrong categories. Like shoes being listed as a dress. I just dropped $100 on tops only to get a shirt described as having “pre-pilling” but had no pilling and instead three holes in the sleeve, two sweaters listed as “like new” but badly pilled, and four tops with bust measurements inches more than described. F this, if they can’t figure out how to describe an item halfway accurately, then I’m not wasting my time and money anymore and am happy to warn others.",1
2767,"Customer service is non existent: Sent in a bag, but had questions. Asked on insta messaging, got a clearly bot response, saw on their website that they direct questions to Twitter, funny since twitter is basically irrelevant and dying but okay, no response. There’s no phone number to call and speak to anyone, tried their app customer service chat & no response there either. Overall, I wouldn’t send them rags again, much less NWT pieces that I want back because I don’t trust them, if they can’t be bothered to answer questions of the people they have items from.",1
2768,"App Inconsistent Customer Service Weak: App keeps being updated but it is not substantially improving. 

Agree with other reviewers weakest part is customer service. Response time at best is many hours later. 

The actual secondhand clothing merchandize is vast. Display content of each item is adequate but access after purchase to that display varies - it is inconsistent. So I do not have material content, condition etc on many of my past purchases.",3
2769,"Best online shopping EVER!!!: Customer service and shopping with ease, all while getting the best bargain on the planet! These are my thoughts when I think of Threadup. I was scriptural the first time I purchased because the prices were so unbelievable. I “tried it out” and received exactly what was shown on the pic for an amazing rate! I have been in love ever since.",5
2770,"Nice and well kept clothes!: What I love about this, close you buy is still in style.  Specially good designers of clothes are well made, so you can go to a thrift store and pay around the same price.  But with threUp you can see the items close up and also you can return if it’s not your size.  Best invented online shopping!!!",5
2771,"Happy shopper: I love thredUP! I always find just what I’m looking for and sometimes, something I’m not looking for but glad I found! Always great quality clothing and I love their return policy if I don’t like the way something fits. ThredUP fits my lifestyle because I don’t live close to any malls so I enjoy shopping from the comfort of my home. I would recommend!",5
2772,Favorite shopping place online: Some feel they don't exactly get top dollar for selling but really it is very comparable to what you get at consignment shops. I've sold through both often. I do enjoy shopping through this site I have been frequenting it for a few years now. Saves me time I can snoop for my favorites. 😊,5
2773,"Extremely disappointed: When selling on through this company, don’t get your hope up. They like to cash out well in the beginning and then with the second bag 25lbs of NWT clothing they offer roughly $3-$7. Also, it is close to impossible to get your items back once you have submitted them. Also, the CEO James had Invited people to email him promising a quickly reply. Two plus weeks later and still nothing 👎",3
2774,"Nice place to shop: I really like shopping from this site. The only thing I would change is that I live in Georgia probably less than an hour away but my shipping is kind of high, and it takes at least two weeks to get the items. Thank goodness for the 10% off, other wise, I couldn’t shop as much as I do. Returns are very easily taken care of.",4
2775,Purses and wallets: I have bought a purse and wallet from thred up. The items I purchased looked so good I thought they were new. I am now able to enjoy nicer things for a fraction of the cost. I can’t pay full price for these expensive brands unless I save up for it! Thanks to thred up I look fashionable and I didn’t have to spend a fortune!,5
2776,"Awful for selling: If you’re looking to sell some great quality items and make a some extra cash, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO IT. Their payout is very very low. I sent in two bags full of gently worn, great quality items and I got $44 for 8 items total. Two of the items had tags and one was a never used Kate Spade Clutch. Over all they were selling my items for over $200. You also have to pay an extra $12 to get the un picked items returned to you. Their customer service is also not very helpful.",2
2777,Sorting better: I wish there would be better way to sort. Maybe have more options. I only buy long sleeves blouses because it’s what we are allowed at work. I find myself looking at 100’s of top to get just a couple of the ones I need.,5
2778,"Love it... but...: As a seller, I love the app. I'd love more access to what I've submitted and its status.

Edited: while the app is fine, the company has changed its policies and is EXTREMELY slow. By the time the bag I sent THIS SPRING is processed THIS FALL, everything I sent will be out of season. Which means I won't get the pay outs I could have gotten if they operated in a timely manner. It's ridiculous. Save your frustration for more important things. Take the time to upload your clothes to Poshmark and make yourself a penny there. It's better than waiting on ThredUP to do their end of the work.",1
2779,"Horrible customer service: I am done with this company. This is the third time I’ve been sent a clothing item that doesn’t even closely match the picture. There is literally no way to contact them. The “chat with us” button doesn’t open on any browser and there is no other email you can use. I can’t just click “start a return” because the item was final sale, but I should not have to pay for something that didn’t match what I thought I was buying.",1
2780,"Great product and good search navigation on this site.: Good searching, love the variety and quality I find. I enjoy seeing photos of my sales and tracking them. I love getting paid with store credit. I feel my items I sell are going to good homes.",5
2781,"Clearly not the same service it was to start: I have used thredUP for several clean outs, unfortunately, they have become extremely negligent with who works there evaluating the bags. Less than 1/2 the pieces were even featured and the ones that were- wouldn’t have been the “best of the bag.” I know the value of the clothes I submitted, and after an extremely long wait…received less than $6! (for 35 pounds of designer clothes including many Athleta pieces). 
I feel so disgusted by this experience",1
2782,"A shoppers paradise!: I received my first order from ThredUP  and was delighted! For under $200 with my first time discount I got a designer dress, two pairs of shoes and 4 pairs of pants.  Everything was in good-great condition and nothing is going back! I’m having fun shopping on the well designed site and have no complaints. Thank you!!",5
2783,"Love it for shopping, not for consigning: I love ThredUp for shopping and have for a long time. Their consignment process, however, is not worth it.

They are picky about what they sell, the payout is extremely minimal to begin with and THEN they take out an additional $15 fee from the payout for shipping and handling fees. So I end up with $0 at the end of sending them good branded items. Won’t be doing that again.",3
2784,"Love saving on higher end/quality items: Often the sizing is off.  The measurements are often not correct which makes it difficult to trust.  I’ve also ordered a top, when received, it was actually a dress.",5
2785,"Great spot to shop: I’ve been using this for a few months and love ThredUP! Have recommended to several friends.

One recent bug: it logs me out now frequently, and didn’t before. Because of this, it prompts me constantly to sign in and it’s hard to use to casually browse now. Please fix :) app has been outstanding beyond this.",4
2786,"Dishonest descriptions: This is my second order with Thred-Up and my last. Both orders had items with extremely vague descriptions of “minor wear.” Minor wear is light wear throughout to pilling or even a pin size hole.  Thred-Up’s minor wear is biohazard armpit stains that smell so bad you have to throw away, and large holes that can’t be seen in photos. That’s why the photos are so blurry, they don’t want you seeing the flaws. Customer service is terrible as you never get help and receive auto message replies that do not apply to you.",1
2787,"Bang for your Buck: I love shopping on line. The one thing you need to know is your measurements, because the sizing in clothes is subjective. Each item has the measurement listed with the size. Even extra large is too small for my chest. I like quality clothes at a reasonable price.",5
2788,"Fraudulent listings: Bought a pair of heels that were listed as brand new with tags. They arrived without tags, visible wear and tear on the soles, a HUGE hole in the back of the heel (like a dog had used it as a chew toy) and the leather worn off around the seams. This is FAR from brand new or even gently used. And since it was a non-returnable item, it’s flat out stealing money. I will not be using this app any longer and will be sure to share my experience with my friends and family.  When you email their customer service it goes unanswered.",1
2789,"Made my phone overheat: After downloading this app, I had issues with my phone losing battery and overheating. When investigating the cause I noticed this app was constantly on in the background refreshing even after being closed out. Once I deleted it all issues were resolved. Overall, disappointed with Thred Up in general. The searching features rely primarily on brand name rather than description. I find Poshmark much easier to use and it has a wider array of options.",1
2790,"Good buys on clothes you love: Love shopping here, but info on an item is a bit vague. I just bought a coat for $60 which stated “minor wear on fabric”. When the coat arrived that wear was a split liner seam and missing button on the cuff. Just wish Thred would provide better information about the condition of the product.",5
2791,So far so good: Just placed my first order. I love Eileen Fisher and this is a new source for me. I also like to buy used clothes. It makes me feel like I am doing my bit to lower my carbon footprint. A wide range of prices which is nice. And I like being able to filter my search. It's a good app. I'm enjoying it.,5
2792,"Just received first order: I just received my first order, I was so impressed by the way the items were packaged and the quick shipping that I placed a second order the same night. Outstanding service and quality. Love this app.",5
2793,"Great!: Great choices for clothes, using the filter to search for what you want is easier than searching by keyword. Sometimes items fit smaller or larger than indicated size, but that's always a gamble with online shopping. Very helpful customer service.",5
2794,Filters: Disappointed that several filters are no longer available. Makes it difficult and time consuming to find a specific item.,5
2795,My go-to way to shop!: Always finding interesting clothes and love the rewards program they have. Customer service is always helpful and so friendly. My only suggestion would be to add a sleeve length option in the dress filter section.,5
2796,ThredUP has made me fall in love with fashion again: After a pregnancy and gaining weight I’ve been in a rut and have had a hard time finding cute plus size clothes. ThredUp offers so many different styles and has changed my life and how I view fashion and myself. And I can actually afford it 🙏🏻,5
2797,"Love thredUP!: ThredUP is my go to for clothes shopping. My nieces think I'm cool for shopping ""pre-worn"". I'm helping the planet. In reality, l shop here because I don't have a lot of excess funds for shopping. At thredUP everything is the right price. I really appreciate the fact you can purchase multiple items with only one shipping charge; unlike so many other ""pre-worn"" sites. Thanks thredUP!!!!",4
2798,"Amazing Shopping Experience: I am thoroughly enjoying purchasing from ThreadUp.  Everything I have received is high quality, in excellent condition, and fits well.   Shipping is fast and I especially appreciate the “bundle shipping” where I can shop for a week and it’s all sent out at once.  I’ve been recommending ThreadUp to my friends.",5
2799,"Uhhh pretty expensive: I love the idea of recycling clothes for others! It is amazing. The items I received in my goodie box had some really worn items and some items that were totally out there and not my style. Which is ok, it’s good to branch out. Though, there is a restocking fee. Ugh. I am not a name brand follower, so these items were very expensive for the condition they were in. I realize I could of had the highest name garnet, and not know it, but regardless it saddened me to chose to cancel this once my return is processed.",2
2800,Satisfied Customer: I received my first box 2 weeks ago and I absolutely loved the items I was sent. Although I didn’t keep everything I was completely satisfied! I have already placed an order for my 2nd box! Can’t wait to see everything!,5
2801,"Very happy customer: Amazing customer service! I noticed an item in my order was not as advertised, and it was outside of their return policy. I reached out to them. They responded immediately, and issued a full refund nonetheless! I have bought many times from them, and have been surprisingly happy every single time!!",5
2802,"So many good things to say!: I’ve had only great experiences shopping with ThredUP! In fact, every time I find myself about to purchase an expensive item like a sweater or dress or even boots I check ThredUP first and almost always find a similar item for less than half of the retail price! It’s good for the environment and great for your wallet.",5
2803,"Not always as expected: The pictures and descriptions the website provides do not always give the full description of an item. For example: a shirt may say it’s a 3/4 sleeve but when you receive it, its actually a “cold shoulder “. Or a shirt that looks solid in the picture and says it’s just one color actually has a small print in another. The prices are good but shopping on this site is definitely hit or miss!",3
2804,"Great bargains: Everything I have ordered has been in great condition. My only complaint would be sending cloths to them they just offer enough compensation I had sent in at least $500 worth of higher end cloths and many had new tags, my compensation was $15.  But I will continue to purchase from them",5
2805,"No deals: This is not a way to save money on clothing. More often than not, items are listed for prices ABOVE what they originally cost at retail. I’ve seen at least 10 items on here that I’ve bought in stores myself at full price listed for more than I paid. They used to send out coupon codes, but now they’re only good for specific (and usually out-of-season) items. They send buttons instead of have sales. It’s gotten to be too expensive to shop on this app, and they don’t make it worth my while anymore.",1
2806,"All they promise and SO MUCH MORE: I have been using ThredUP for a couple of months.  
All I can say is: Just try it. Now.  You are likely to be blown away with the deals, quality and over-the-top customer service.  Example: they pay for shipping on returns!

There is so much to love.  Topped off by almost all easily recyclable paper-based packaging.",5
2807,"Love the site but....: Love thredUP, however over the past few years the prices have been going up, promo codes are fewer and farther between, and just last week I noticed that the minimum purchase for shipping went up to $79. My purchases have become more planned or on as as need basis instead of a fun, inexpensive, impulse buy.",5
2808,"Pretty great, could be even better!: I wish I could save different “my sizes” for tops and bottoms since I wear different sizes in those two areas it would make filtering and browsing easier. I also wish I could browse more common brands rather than have to type them in. 

Overall I like using the app and the site. It makes thrifting and shopping 2nd hand easy.",4
2809,"Review: I’ve enjoyed thrifty shopping my favorite brands and styles. Returns are easy. One time there was an issue with a shipment and they resolved it in a professional manner, I have bought and sold.

I have had better luck reselling on ThredUP then with my local retail store. 

I’m losing weight, so I love that I can pick out some new clothes, even NWT, at these prices.",5
2810,"App update regressed.: I’m not sure what happened with the most recent update. The “my brand” saved filter disappeared. Also selecting “condition” used to be an AND operator, now it appears  to not be working.  I select “ New with tags” and “like-new”,  And only “new with tags” items show up.  This makes it very difficult to search for items I want. I have to re-enter in all filter criteria is every single time. Yikes! Hope you guys fix this.",3
2811,Brand names items-Walmart prices: As a 17 year old girl I’m always looking for good deals on clothes. My favorite brands are VS PINK and Adidas- and let me tell you I have gotten the best deals on this site. I just placed my THIRD order in about a month. I started on the full site and recently got the app. This is an amazing idea and I’ve recommended it to everyone I know.,5
2812,"Great service, place to shop, buggy app: I use this site and app a lot, so I'm used to it shutting down a lot in the middle of browsing. I buy and sell a lot here, so I find it valuable both for cleaning out and getting new things. The ease of sending stuff in bulk and getting credit back has kept me a loyal buyer and seller.",5
2813,"I buy almost all my clothes here now: So many great deals on designer clothes. Quality and condition of clothes has always been as described, and returns are easy and seamless. The app is wonderfully designed and very functional - I love the new ""Favorites"" feature so I can save things I love for later. I recommend this to all my friends!",5
2814,"ThredUp: Good and user friendly
Would be a great improvement if more measurements were avail. as well a fabric content and if photos were all taken at a standard distance from item  in order to better judge length, etc. Plus bottoms should be shown folded and or hung as they are displayed in shops. Especially if measurements are lacking.",5
2815,"""all natural"" 💜💙💚💛🧡❤️💝: DESPITE the fact (I suspect) it's increased the level of competition, im delighted with the addition of the ""all natural"" filter. I used to manually select ""material"" each time but I love ❤️ this all-in-1...
 all good things!! I adore it on environmental grounds, economic grounds, availability of 🌎 obscure brands (searchable database!! 📊) just add ""pockets"" to the details and the vision is COMPLETE! 😍🥰😘",5
2816,"Shipping Mistake: I was told my package would come Wednesday, then it got delayed to Thursday, and it’s Thursday at 11:30pm right now and no package. My tracker still says it should be delivered Thursday. Not very punctual for my first experience. 
Shopping wise I like thredUP a lot though! Easy to navigate and prices can be good. I wish there was more photos and measurements at times though.",4
2817,"Search needs improvement: I’ve been a patron for years. The search bar doesn’t actually search. For example, if I type in a specific brand, the returned results are from a wide variety of unrelated brands. While I recognize that I can use the filter to search by a specific brand, it takes more steps/ less than ideal experience to do so.",3
2818,"layout glitch: I have been using thred up for years and love it, however, when I go to add garments from my liked collection the heart icon is basically right on the clothing so when I click on the image of the clothes it unlikes what I saved and then I can’t find that piece again. It may be some issue with the app rather the website, but I tend to use the app more.",3
2819,"Rip-off: I submitted 6 items for sale. Only 4 were listed and I don’t know what happened to the other two pieces. They were never listed nor ever returned. They pay pennies on the dollar. One of my dresses sold for $24 and I was credited $1.54, which I never received because it went towards the cost of shipping. In the end, they sold 4 articles of clothing that I sent, and I received nothing. There is no customer service number, the only method of communication is via email or chat online. This is a scam",1
2820,Love: I absolutely love this app! I find a many great deals bargains and prices. Not even for me because I have a odd shaped body but for my kids especially I find things for them I know they will look good in! I really appreciate this app and all behind it to make it happen. Thank you!!!!!!,5
2821,"Highly aggressive marketing emails: Every time you save a search on the app, ThredUP, automatically reenrolls you in email notifications for that search, even if you have already opted out / unsubscribed. This results in being absolutely SPAMMED with emails that you have already unsubscribed to on multiple occasions. I don’t know if this is a glitch or just a shamelessly aggressive marketing tactic, but it really overshadows the more positive aspects of using this site.",2
2822,"Thrift huh!: I placed an order because I had a discount for a first time buyer and let me tell you, IF THIS is suppose to be a “thrift” shop then it’s WAY overpriced especially for things that aren’t even name brand. This may be good for finding unique items you really want, but these are not the prices I think of when the word “thrift” is involved. I know it’s because of shipping and handling and profit, but wow!!!",3
2823,Love It!: Well I was wondering how was I going to shop for some clothes but lacking the will to go shop. A friend told me about ThredUp and it’s been my go to app since! It’s a great app to have and very user friendly. The people are easy to work with if you have questions etc.,5
2824,I wish I’d used it sooner!: My absolute favorite place to buy clothes. The number of quality pieces I can get for the money is incredible. It also makes it super easy to clear out my kids’ closets and my own. The clean out kit is a great way to earn shipping credit. Love. Love. Love.,5
2825,The app itself isn’t bad: The app isn’t bad.  The store is full of beautiful things for every taste. The only inconvenience is the return policy in particular when they send the wrong item size. They do reimburse you the money but now you have to dispose the item or donate it because you can’t return it. Which makes no sense since the whole concept is to thrift and save the planet.,3
2826,Only Shop On Thred Up: I have such a hard time shopping at stores online or in person because I can never find what I’m looking. More than half of my wardrobe is from Thred Up because of their wide selection and cheap prices. So glad I found this app!,5
2827,"Great Selection: There are almost too many choices the inventory is so vast!  I love the variety and quality of the clothes as well as the discounts.
My one suggestion is to provide a couple more filters for the swimsuits:  if we could break down the list to bottoms only or tops only, that would be helpful.
Thank you!",4
2828,"It’s okay.: The concept of this app is great, but the pictures offered are so low quality. I dont know if I’m looking at a cat hair, a lint, or a legit tear. You can barely make out the texture of the fabric because the pictures are so awful.

The app offers no real-life models, so there is no way to reference whether something will fit you correctly. I can expect many returns.

There is no option to save brands you like, and you have to reset it every time using the filter search. I tried to save brands, numerous times, in the saved sizes section, and the app would freeze completely every time.

I would say overall the app is a huge waste of time. I gave it a real shot and it was so time-consuming. Even with filters it takes so much effort to find what you want. Honestly, just visit a thrift store.",1
2829,"Easy Thrifting: I love ThredUp!  I really enjoy being able to search for brands, patterns, and styles I like. They have great sales, rewards, and I’ve been enjoying their “shop this look” feature.  It’s a lot of fun to use the app, and I’ve found some of my favorite clothing through it.",5
2830,"New rewards program is bad: If you’re looking for a good deal, this platform isn’t great, especially since they changed their rewards program. It used to be fairly easy to save up points and use them for purchases, and I had saved up a lot (almost 3,000 points). Now with the new rewards program they changed that to under 300 points. They don’t offer $10 off anymore either, it’s $5 off per order. Won’t be shopping on this platform anymore.",1
2831,"Obsessed with thredUP: Imagine shopping all of your favorite brands, paired down by size, style, color, etc. and in a way that’s good for the environment? That’s thredUP. The app is great (my only problem is that I haven’t figured out how to look at ONLY petite sizes like I can on the website). Everything else is great.",5
2832,"Used to be a big fan: I used to love shopping on thredUP, lately though, almost every item I order is stained or damaged in some way despite filtering my search to new or like new. Love finding out-of-production vintage/designer stuff, or just unique items, but such a bummer when they come stained or some way unwearable. Also their sizing for jeans/bottoms never makes sense to me - always kind of a gamble.",3
2833,"App isn’t good, ThredUp is awesome: I love ThredUp. I’ve sold and bought a ton of items for me and my daughter. (Crossing my fingers and hoping they’ll get a side going for my husband!) That said, the app is super buggy and not nearly as user friendly as the actual website. I mostly just serf for new favorites with the app and wait to do everything else until I get on the website with my laptop.",3
2834,"Send out “excellent” clothes with HOLES: I don’t typically write reviews but this seems worth mentioning. I would caution people against buying from ThredUP specifically. Despite being listed as “excellent condition”, both items in my order had large holes in them. Whereas there is recourse on platforms like Depop, Mercari, and eBay if an item is not described since they often come from independent sellers, ThredUP does not offer this advantage. Instead, you’re left with a measly return window, restocking fees, and smelly “excellent” clothes with holes in them.",1
2835,"Would recommend: I have purchased several items from threads up and everything I got was a really high-quality exactly how it was described, fit perfectly. I have no complaints. And I’m definitely going to continue to order from them in the future",5
2836,"Great service, and helping the planet too: Love the options of buying second hand but also having options to filter for new with tags. Clothes arrive when it says and if you have any issues with delivery customer services is very kind and helpful. Totally recommend",5
2837,"Deceptive Pictures: I have ordered from thredUP multiple times and probably will again. Just a warning, look closely at the photos. I have had 3 instances where I order what I think are plain pants or jeans and when they arrive they have a prominent stripe down the sides of the legs. This stripe was not shown in the item picture or described in the item description. It made at least one pair useless and it cost too much to return.",3
2838,Good items terrible shipping: Items are as described and there are many great deals on high end fashion. The only problem is shipping. This is my second order that didn’t arrive on time and now is just ‘pending’ according to fedex. Standard shipping is 1-5 days and I have never received any of my orders in less than 8 days. You need to decide if the item is worth the extra 6$ for shipping and the extended time to wait for your item.  It’s discouraging me from wanting to order again.,2
2839,Poor customer service: This was my second order from thredUP. It was supposed to arrive in 2 packages. I got 1 package. The second went from having a delivery date to “Delivery status: Pending.” I then see I was refunded for the items in the package but was never notified the order had been cancelled. They just cancelled it after it had already shipped which makes no sense at all. They could have at least had the courtesy to notify me of the cancellation of my order.,2
2840,"Second Chance: I am trying again, i have made many purchases in the past few months...have loved many of them....unfortunately a handful of my most recent purchase have been sized incorrectly.  So I am giving you guys another chance...🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻",5
2841,Not as described.: The main issue I’m having when purchasing items is they are not as described. I typically search for 100% cotton or organic cotton. Several times I have purchased an item and once it’s delivered I can clearly see on the label these items are not cotton. Then I have to deal with the entire return process. Plus I’m stuck with the restocking fee! The processing team needs to do a much better job at having the correct fabric details on each item. Very annoying!,2
2842,Wish this app supported Men’s clothing: I was drawn to this app because I read about the option of sending in all your clothes you needed sold and the company could handle the rest. I am a male in my twenties and I would love to use this service if it was offered for men. I can understand why you haven’t added that a Men’s section to the site but please let me know when you do!,4
2843,"Easy Peasy: It has never been easier and more cost-efficient to own quality brands! ThredUP makes it very easy to return clothing that doesn’t fit, and they constantly offer great discounts. I prefer to shop at socially and environmentally-conscious businesses and ThredUP definitely makes it easy and affordable. Love this site!",5
2844,"Getting Unhappy: I’ve spent hundreds on this app but now prices are getting way higher than they originally were. I’m sorry but this is used clothing, ex a dress from say Old Navy should not be $25, you can get it for less off their clearance rack...the prices need to go back down before I’ll order again.",5
2845,Overall good: The only main cons I see are that when you do the goody box you can only select from your local warehouse. And the other is that bags and jewelry are final purchases. I once bought a purse that said it was in as new condition but when it arrived the strap was peeling badly so I had to buy one that matched as much as possible to the purse. Unfortunately I couldn’t return it.,4
2846,"Convenient but costly: I’ve always loved ThredUp (probably one of the first people to consign & buy with them...that’s how long), but it seems prices have gone up and earnings have gone down. It’s a quick way to find something I need for myself or kids while staying home, but some of the items I can get new for less than what ThredUp is selling for if I went to a store. Not sure about continuing a relationship with them.",3
2847,"Would have been 5 stars: When I signed on and made my first few orders, there were free returns, and I learned how to get fewer duds so I wasn’t sending back so much. Now there’s a $2 restocking fee per item sent back. This new fee doesn’t impact me a whole lot now, but it definitely would have mattered when I started out, and this change makes me hesitant to recommend friends.",4
2848,"Simply the BEST!: I LOVE thredUP so much! So simple to shop and the clothes are on point! I’ve been able to add some dream pieces to my closet and it wouldn’t have been possible without thredUP. I have recently lost a good amount of weight and so I need some pieces to get me through until I’m ultimately where I want to be. If you haven’t tried it, you are missing OUT!",5
2849,GREAT VALUE: i saw this app advertised and thought i would download it to see what they had and i instantly found numerous things from my favorite brands!!! i have already placed an order and i’m so excited to get it in the mail! the app is user friendly and i love how you can input your own sizes to see what is available!,5
2850,"Surprised by the selection!: First time buyer here - actually was not expecting the great brands and selection that Thred Up offers! I got my order in about a week and the clothes were perfect. No stains, nothing short of just new clothes.  They didn’t smell like a thrift store, and were beautifully packaged.  Will buy again soon!",5
2851,"Great Service: I love ThredUP and I have found lots of bargains on their site.  My only disappointment is that for a short while they had free shipping and I was able to buy a lot during that time free shipping has now ended and it will really slow my buying down, please bring back free shipping and you will have a great site.",5
2852,"Does what it is supposed to: The app works like it is supposed to. I like that I can sort based on item condition (which you can’t from a mobile browser). I don’t like that you can’t see how long something is/will be in your/others carts (like you can in the mobile browser).
Overall, I usually use the app, but sometimes I use the browser.",4
2853,"First Purchase from Thred Up: I absolutely love this! I loved that I was able to filter my search by the brands I like and my personal sizes. Along with that, they gave 40% off my first order! The package came sooner than expected, it was presented very nicely, and all of the items were in great condition! I'll definitely be a returning customer.",5
2854,Love it!: I've used this app a few times and I've been very happy with my orders. I've also sent some clothes back using the clean out bag as well. It's a good way to reduce waste. I also like the function where I can narrow down the search based on fabric material,5
2855,"Bug: Right now if you search for something specific and click on an item, there’s no return arrow to get back to where you were looking. Instead, you have to go all the way back to the search and start from the beginning. This has never been an issue before, so it must have been overlooked in an update.",3
2856,"Inaccurate sizing: I got a $60 order and none of the clothes fit. Two different sizes are listed on the site, one beneath the title and one in an image with the product, two VERY different sizes. I got two pairs of jeans that had this issue and with one, the image size was correct and with another it was the size listed beneath the title. This genuinely such a big issue as returns come with a fee, and I was so excited for them. I really hope this gets addressed.",2
2857,"Three year buyer: Purchased several items-designer & everyday brands. Highly over priced on a lot of items. Watch for improper descriptions and possible counterfeit accessories. I wish I could return at least 20 things as over spent for poor quality. Overall, one can find unique items.",4
2858,"Disappointed: I wanted to like thredUP so bad, and I did for a while. But things have changed. Shipping is way too expensive. Additionally, I sold them clothes and made zero dollars. Because they charge so much for the clean out kit and your proportion of the sale is low, unless you have designer items it’s not worth your time. Better to try to sell local or just donate. Sad this business model just doesn’t seem to work.",2
2859,"ThredUP is a scam: I’ve used ThredUP three times, including one clean out. What they don't tell you is that when you send them your clothes, they make you pay a $15 fee- to sell your own clothes!!! Also they mark down your clothes so much and then don’t send them back when they don't sell. So I lost money and several of my clothing items to this scam. 

I’ve bought clothes from ThredUP two times and both times, the clothing quality was lower than explained in the description.",1
2860,My new shopping addiction: I love everything about this company. I love shopping for clothes that come in new with tags and like-new. I love recycling through ThredUP and watching the clothes make their way to someone else who will keep them from a landfill. And the app is so easy to use.,5
2861,Wonderful: I was going through a difficult time and was able to purchase items that were high quality at very reasonable prices and I was grateful that this shopping experience actually helped me greatly.,5
2862,"Great way to thrift online: It would be great if you could easily send that there’s an issue with the image

Really wish you could maybe get some of the textile waste (clothes they can’t sell) to have fabric for cheap that would otherwise be wasted.",5
2863,"So easy to use!: I absolutely love TredUp and their app is very user-friendly and straight-forward. The clothes are nicely displayed, which I personally love and appreciate. The filter function makes it super easy to narrow down your search and find what you’re looking for. Great app!",5
2864,"Don’t send your clothing here: I sent my items in July. We are now into November and they have yet to even go through my items. I sent 4 bags; my kits came in June and since the email they received my 4 bags back in early July, my status is still “pending”.  I’m afraid my items are in limbo and I can’t get a straight answer from anyone at ThredUP and I wish I just went to my local consignment. I’m now at a 5 month mark with zero communication. Don’t waste your time unless you have forever and a day to wait.",1
2865,"false advertising: I have bought only once and everything was fine, but I have noticed that your advertising is misleading;  because when they do flash sales for high percentages, the programmers put the clothing pieces at a higher price and thus apply a 60% discount.  previously you could have your favorites for 12 hours, now only 1 hour.  very bad.  maybe in the future if things get better , i changed my review .",2
2866,"Clean out kit: I have sent many clean out kits & with excellent clothes in them some brand new never worn & they never even acknowledge those clothes for consignment. I think they are keeping them for themselves because they are definitely able to be sold. Or maybe they are selling them I should look for what I sent, on their site. It’s a gimmick. It’s not consignment, it’s more like you are donating to them. I’d rather give my things to someone in need, than to give them to thread up, to profit off of…….",1
2867,"The Best Way to Shop for the Enviroment: I like to purchase from ThredUp to save money on the brands I know I like. No running to the mall or waiting on a sale. 
Additionally, I feel the purchase of clothes that have been previously owned is better for the environment. It’s a small step but it is a step.",5
2868,"Need dark screen option on thread up app: I love thredup but hate that they don’t have a dark screen option on their app.  I have to search thredUP on the internet and not use the app because the white background leads to macular degeneration.  Also, they need to add pajama sets and shapewear categories.",5
2869,"This app DESTROYED my battery: I opened this app ONE TIME. A week after I downloaded it, I thought my phone had broken because it was overheating and my battery was dying so quickly despite not much usage. NOPE. Checked battery health in settings, and this app was using 11% of my battery for “notifications.” guess it was running in the background constantly despite not having permission to do so?

Either way, my phone immediately stopped overheating upon deletion of this app. Ridiculous.",1
2870,"I love the idea, but not the restocking fee :(: I really wanted to love thred up.  I like the idea of it, but I would not pay $2/item to try something on in the store, so I struggle woth having to pay $2 if I purchase something (used, mind you…with minimal photos) and it doesn’t work out.  For those of us on a budget, this becomes a deal killer. Especially when so many retailers offer free returns…",3
2871,"The best way to shop.: I haven’t bought anything anywhere else in a while. I have purchased many high quality “like new” and “NWT” items on ThredUp. They’re quick, sustainable and premium brands. The shipping and return is great!  I will never shop fast fashion again!",5
2872,"Love the app: I never order from thredUP yet. I wanted to see how the goody box goes. I send two boxes in April, and it still said processing to this day august 18th. I send them an email and the email me back stating that I should recess payout on the 22nd of August. Something told me check the status and now is saying that I should be receiving on 8th of September. If I’m not receiving a payment I want these new stuff back….. I would rather sell it on Poshmark. There I know I’ll get pay.",2
2873,"Comeback Discount: I was very disappointed at check out when my “comeback” discounts were not applied at check out. I emailed customer service and all
They wanted to do was give me 15% off my next order. Why would I want to order again when I overpaid by a long shot in the order that should have been discounted. Think I’ll go back to not using this app and use one that honors discounts the way they are offered.",2
2874,"My go-to!!: I spread the gospel of thredUP whenever I can. Getting to reduce the demand on our planet’s resources and give new life to existing items adds another dimension of joy to shopping!

The new update for sorting our wishlists is great!!! I do wish we could organize them into boards, too, though.",5
2875,🌟Fabulous!🌟: I don’t usually write reviews for apps but this was too good and I had to share. I love shopping but sometimes I’m not look for something specific and I just want to browse. This app is perfect for that! And on top of that they have great prices that don’t blow a hole in your wallet.,5
2876,"Perfect except for one thing: I absolutely love ThredUp, and the app is well designed with the same functionality as the website. My only gripe with ThredUp, and this is regarding the business more-so than the app, but they really need to consistently put in the same measurements for the same types of clothing and they really need to add shoulder width measurements for tops and dresses with sleeves. Other than that, amazing *chef’s kiss*",4
2877,"Slow and not user friendly: I can never seem to find certain features and spend more time looking for them than using the actual app. They give time frames that are never accurate. Everything is very slow and delayed, the only thing they are quick to jump on is taking your money. I had high hopes for this app but have come up disappointed at every turn.",2
2878,Do not waste your money: I ordered couple dresses. Unfortunately they didn’t fit me. They smelled and did look like the picture. So when I tried to to return I have to pay a return fee and the shipping fee resulting in basically no money. I then comprised and asked for store credit in which they took out the fees and after spending over $50 after 2 weeks only got $6.00 in my account. I highly don’t recommend this website and please don’t waste your time.,1
2879,"Don’t sell to them: I haven’t tried ordering anything because I haven’t seen anything I like but, I thought I would send some clothes in to earn some money. First, it took 9 or 10 months to process the clothes. Next, they take a huge portion of the money. For example, I listed something as $11, I’m making $0.91. Sold some shoes for $21, I’m making $3.26. Sold something for $8, I’m making $0.48! If you are just looking to get rid of clothes donate them instead or sell them on some other site. This should be your last option.",1
2880,ThredUP Rocks!: I have been shopping on ThredUP since the summer of 2013 and basically every piece of clothing I own I bought there. It has completely transformed my wardrobe because I can afford high-end pieces and more of them! I get compliments all the time on my outfits and always just say “ThredUP!!”,5
2881,"Online Thrifting: This is my first time using this app, but I absolutely love it! It’s easy to use and this site has such a wide variety of clothing styles and options! I found awesome deals right away. I think I’m going to become slightly addicted to browsing this app for new thrifty finds. Definitely worth checking out!",5
2882,"Highly recommend!: All you have to do is take one look around ThredUP and you’ll fall in love. The designers, the “shop by size” feature, all the shopping filters and of course the AMAZING deals! It’s a fun and easy to use app AND you’re helping give new life to thrifted clothing! Definitely a must have for the online shopper.",5
2883,Guilty? no - guilt free pleasure: Finally a place to find really special clothing that makes me light up-happy happy! at reasonable prices. And the sales. And the points! I keep telling myself I should stop buying but I just keeping finding so many special things. My one guilty pleasure yet why feel guilty when so much good results? It’s a win win!,5
2884,"Best Clothing Subscription I’ve Tried: I’ve tried Wantable (the worst! Bad styling, cheap clothes and $$$), Stitch Fix (not much better), and Trunk Club ($$$). There are so many stylish clothes in my size (I’m tall!) that would be tough to afford new. You can purchase outright and/or order goody boxes. Plus you can send off your own clothes for consignment. My new addiction!",5
2885,"Outstanding: Their customer service is amazing! I was able to chat immediately with a person when I had to update my info. No computerized stuff, an actual person and they were so helpful. Great selection of clothes and quick shipping. Definitely worth it!",5
2886,Go to for growing kids: I can’t say enough about how much I love thredUP. I refuse to spend full price on name brand clothes for my kids. With jeans costing 50-80$ a pair there’s just no way I’d spend that on a pair of pants they’ll probably grow out of in a few months. The clothes I find on threadup are such great quality and great prices. Love the variety.,5
2887,"Try poshmark instead!: I have sent a large bag of items with tags brand new on 3/1/20, it was received or atleast noted that they got it on 4/1, nothing has happened since! I have reached out twice already with out any answers! They just blame it on covid! Also they say check your sales listing...which directs you to nowhere!!!! I even paid to have my items returned, which is even more frustrating!!!! My husband is an attorney and looking into this... because something is fishy! Don't waste your time- sell your items on another site!",1
2888,"Know your brands!: I’ve ordered quite a bit and have had great success. I’m not saying everything has been perfect, which is why I say know your brands. Not all sizes are the same. It would be nice to have general measurements, then I would be inclined to purchase more, especially since returns are about $10.",5
2889,"Do not use this app.: Actually READ the reviews people, a lot of them are rated 5 stars simply so they’ll be noticed or because of mistake but if you actually READ the reviews you’ll see that A LOT of them are very negative. This seems like a scammy app with low payouts and the selling feature seems very sketch and difficult compared to literally every other selling app. There are 4 other apps you would have better luck with than this one. Also, I was under the impression the clothes were supposed to be on the cheaper side....???",1
2890,"Lost bag: I sent in a bag over a month and a half ago. I have yet to receive confirmation that ThredUP got my bag. When I reached out about it. They told me they received my first bag and said everything was all set. Showing that they didn’t even read my email fully. O emailed back and I told them I wasn’t asking for much, a small compensation for the lost bag of $25-50 dollars. They emailed me back stating the same thing as before they received my first package. 
Overall disappointed in the customer service of this company. 
Will NOT be using them again",1
2891,"I like it: I have used thred up for years and i really like the free returns and i can usually find clothing i like. But please thred up, lularoe leggings and tops and the scarves have got to go! They are time wasters for customers to scroll through when scrolling through all. Please put scarves in their own category, and just say no to lularoe! But thanks, I’ve enjoyed being a user for many years:)",4
2892,"Thrifting Made Easy: I absolutely love thread up. It makes second hand shopping so easy, I love that I can find unique pieces from Brands I would shop normally and if something doesn’t work the return process is easy and great. It also makes cleaning out my closet seasonally a breeze and I like knowing I’m restocking someone else’s closet!",5
2893,Great items.: I received my first item today. It was great. I had no issues with my order and the item was exactly like what was shown. It wasn’t worn or tattered nor did it have any weird smells(which can happen when you buy used). Over al I am pretty happy. I’m giving this a 4 star because I am waiting for my second package and I hope it is just as great.,4
2894,"Fantastic So Far: I love this app! I needed pants for baby in a hurry but ended up getting pants and tops because the prices were so good! About 13 things only cost me around $20. They came in a reasonable amount of time and all the clothes were as expected. Since then, I have ordered a few more times and no complaints so far.",5
2895,"Don’t sell on here: I decided to try clearing out my closet using thredUP. I sent them a whole bag of stuff, some things had never been worn, including a brand new JCP jacket. The payout I got for each item was .50 at most. A lot of the items didn’t sell because the app will barely let you lower the too high prices that they’re selling used clothes at, and you don’t get a payout if the items don’t sell. I could have sold that jacket on eBay for at least $15 if I hadn’t wanted to try this app.",2
2896,Lacking Customer Service: Thread Up is a great idea.  The prices are high for thrift shopping.  They also give you pennies for what you mail in.  The customer support is lacking. You have to chat and an automated chat tells you it will be a couple hours. I had to change my password and it deleted my whole account.  They have a bag of my clothes and I just sent in a return so I may never see any of this again.  They also advertise a free pin with every purchase and this just isn’t true. I wouldn’t give 1 star if I didn’t have to.,1
2897,"Overall App Interaction: The app has a lot of really good items but the user interface is not appealing. The format makes it so that you really have to search through to find good things and you kind of have to know what you want and know how to search for it. If there were suggestions or something like on Poshmark where they suggest items to you, the navigation would be so much better.",3
2898,"Needs More Info: I’ve been using this app for a few months and have bought many items. For the most part, it’s fun and easy and economical. However, there are so many items I’m interested in that don’t have any basic measurements listed! Please, developers, if you’re reading this, add measurements for every item! I won’t buy without them as a guide.",4
2899,Clean out: I think this website is great to buy things from but I will not sell them my things again. They do not pay you near the amount they end up selling your clothing for. However if you just want to get rid of clothes with the possibility to make a little money this may be what you are looking for. Ending thought: if you want to make any money on your clothes I would not send them to threadup.,3
2900,Live it up with TrendUp: This has been the best online shopping experience. Working full time with two young children and already having tried other online shops. ThredUP has never disappointed!! Love the quantity and quality of their clothing. I will continue to recommend to friends and SHOP.,5
2901,"Not what it used to be.: I used to be obsessed with ThredUp and it was the only place I would shop. I’ve grown more and more disappointed over the last two years. You don’t get much for the clothes you send in to sell (even with name brand items) and the items you buy are becoming more and more over priced. I might as well shop at regular retail stores because I’m not saving as much as I used to on ThredUp, which was a major part of it’s appeal. I will be deleting this app.",2
2902,"Love Thred Up, app needs help: No way to view saved searches or to save a search in the app. Also, unlike the website, it lumps favorite items that are in someone else’s cart in with those that sold so you have to sort through to see which ones might become available. Didn’t have any trouble purchasing through the app, just trouble finding what I’m looking for. I’ll stick to the website.",3
2903,I love this app!: Having the best time shopping at Thred Up. Have got some great deals! I really love how clear the pictures are and each item has specific measurements! Because of this everything I have purchased FITS beautifully and I am surprised how the items look brand new! Great quality and fun/easy to use app. Thred Up for life!,5
2904,"Love this App: ThredUP is really cool and a great way to get inexpensive, high quality clothes. However, the shipping takes absolutely forever. It took 2 days from the time I placed the order until the time that it was processed and shipped out. It then took 6 days to get delivered at my door. I wouldn’t recommend buying something for a specific event because you most likely won’t get it on time, unless you buy way in advance.",3
2905,"Wish I could give 0 stars: For starters 65% of their items are tacky shirts from the early 2000’s that you’d never see anyone wearing today. I also turned in an entire bag of clothing and only got $9 dollars for it, which I can only buy 2 pairs of shorts that were actually cute and found out even with the 20% off discount I couldn’t even buy a pair of $4 dollar shorts with the money I earned because their shipping is ridiculous, even  when it comes from the neighboring state. I’m very upset and am never using again, would never recommend.",1
2906,"Great find!: I love purchasing on this site. I’ve been very pleased with the products and selection and what I get for the money I spend. Like I’ve seen wrote elsewhere-the payout for selling is minuscule. And I also had a new pair of shorts with tag on it with the price showing and the “estimated retail” was lower than the tag price. Was upsetting as I felt a little swindled. Also-you can’t lower the prices of consignment items to entice people to buy them. I will certainly keep buying, but not so sure about selling.",2
2907,My favorite place to shop: It took me a bit of time to figure out how to shop on Thredup since there are thousands of items. I leaned to narrow down my searches and focus on specific brands and ever since then I have found so many gems at great prices.,5
2908,The BEST way to shop!: I just opened like my 10th order from thredUP and got a $231 dress with tags for like $10. I can get an entire box of clothes for like $75-80. It’s crazy! The app is SO easy to use and makes me love clothes shopping. I have recommended it to all my friends….repeatedly! ♥️♥️♥️,5
2909,I love it. I never pay retail anymore.: Gosh- I love the variety all together. I’ve never felt anything was misrepresented (condition). It’s easy to navigate. I spend hours tooling around on here and never run out of things to look at. I also send things in and get credits for shopping.,5
2910,"Great but could use improvement: I love getting quality items at great prices. 
I would like it better if the pictures of the items were better. It is hard to see the detail. On items like bags and wallets, it would be beneficial to see the inside of them as well.",4
2911,"Love it, but…..: When I submit auto-buy if available, please DON’T tell the person who currently has it in their cart!  That’s like tattling!  I’m never pressing auto-buy again!  I will just wait until it times out and drops from their cart.",5
2912,"Fun shopping: I love shopping on thread up , I find lots of good buys and cute clothes.   It’s easy and I don’t have to drive all over town    Prices are reasonable and shipping is also not too expensive and can be nothing if you purchase a certain amount!   
I will keep shopping here.   
DW",5
2913,Absolutely horrible…..: ThredUP never contacted me I happened to see that one of my items sold for $70 & my payout was $30. Several days later I checked back and my item was no where to be found. I contacted ThredUP & there reply was they lost my item & will try to do better in the future to not make this mistake again.  That’s it?!?!?  I replied that this was unacceptable & they should reimburse me for my item. They have made zero contact with me since my comment which was 4 days ago. Now what? ☹️,1
2914,Absolutely love it!: I am so amazed at the selection available! I enjoy shopping and look forward to everything I purchase.  I have also enjoyed sending items in to sell.  It’s an awesome experience in every way! You have to try it!,5
2915,Long Time Customer! BARBARA FARRELL: And still loving it! Be careful…..you ccould get hooked on it…. I surely am!    ‘Cause there’s NO other way to purchase your style clothing in The Best Shape for The Very Best Price Possiible! PLUS!!!! It’ s the hunt itself that makes it all the more fun!!!!!! TRY IT…..much more exciting than Store Shopping…..make sure you let me know!!XXXX!$$$$Barbie$$$$XXXX,5
2916,"Addicting Way to Thrift: I’ve pleasantly surprised by the quality of all the items I’ve bought from ThredUP so far. The filters let you narrow in on what you’re looking for, which is super handy. Once you start finding pieces you like it’s kind of addicting!",5
2917,"Clean Out Program: I sent in Several Items, (Approx 12) through the program .  When they did the inventory and listing, they left 4 items out . After contacting them , They would not acknowledge the error and correct it .  I don’t believe I will use this clean out program in the future .  Just easier to take my items to the local consignment shop or donate to a local thrift store .",2
2918,"Obsessed with this app!: I love this app! I can scroll through clothes in my size for hours on here. Although you don’t get “thrift store prices” here, it’s still cheaper, and easier to search for something instead of going to a thrift store! It’s even better when they have a sale going on in the app.",4
2919,"Pay more for shipping ThredUP your profit margins are HUGE enough to afford it: ThredUP makes waaaaaay too much profit (paying not even full pennies on the dollar for items, charging return fees, cost of shipping, “losing” expensive items customers send in to be sold etc) to use the cheapest most inefficient shipping available and from FedWx of all the poor carriers to choose from. 

DO NOT bundle. Your package will get lost. 
DO NOT buy anything coming the GA factory, your package will get lost. 

Then it takes WEEKS to hear from anyone about a refund. And this is weeks after searching and curating the perfect bundle. What a total and complete waste. 

For a company that claims to be about sustainability they are sitting back and enjoying huge profits while their customers are repeatedly screwed over by their cheapness.",1
2920,"A Really Smart Way to Make Thrifting Fun: I don’t want to write a whole page about this app, but so far I have no complaints. 
It’s really fun to scroll through cute dresses and sweaters, and the fact that it’s all thrifted is awesome.
Would recommend for building a new wardrobe, or just having fun!",5
2921,"Scam: I wanted to like this app. I am all for re-using clothing and giving my clothes new homes when I am not in love with them anymore but this makes it hard to commit to it. It’s hard to justify the fact that I sold 6 items in the app and cannot buy not even one item on sale!! If I sell on your service, I don’t want to pay extra for my next item. That is unfair. And that is why I think this system has too many middleman and doesn’t work. Back to consignment stores.",1
2922,"I have bought and sold on app!: I have bought and sold on this app many times. My last purchase was a purse that was said to be in “excellent” condition. It is a well used purse with gum stuck in the pockets. Getting into contact with customer service is extremely hard. I have also “lost” many pieces of clothing that were consigned, again when messaging customer service, I heard nothing back. So disappointing!!",2
2923,"The only place I shop for clothes: This is the only place I have shopped for clothes on in a long time, not only have I made over 100$ on this but I have bought probably about 500$ of clothes for   1/5 of the price, completely recommend love it so
Much !!!",5
2924,"purchasing…: is easier than selling. I made a high mistake and sent them a bag of designer pieces (9) items. They were lost. Part my fault, didn’t follow instructions . BUT a high detailed note with all m information and the items I had listed??? no one ever found.",5
2925,"OBSESSED: I do all my clothes shopping on this app. I love scoring a good deal, and am very pleased with the selection, packaging, ease of returning items, and customer service. 90% of my wardrobe is from ThredUP. Having it on an app makes shopping a breeze. LOVE IT! Honestly cannot think of anything I’m unhappy about.",5
2926,"Low quality: Pictures are horrible and too few. There seems to be zero concern with presentation. Search options are limited and don’t always work. Too many stipulations on using perks, points and promo codes. I often want to make a purchase, but shopping on here gives me a headache",4
2927,"Love!!: I love ThredUP! Most of the clothes I buy now seem to come from them. I love how environmentally friendly they are, the selection of clothing, the prices, etc. They also make returns really easy. It’s easy to get points that you can use towards discounts or free shipping. Affirm is available. Love love love.",5
2928,Selection smart: I love the idea of preowned and pre loved items. I fit a size O or sometimes xxs which is easier to find from other people than in stores.   The hard part is making decisions because there’s so many to choose from.,5
2929,"Love it!: I love the app and the ease of shopping, especially with categories and filters! Thank you for making shopping so enjoyable, a past time I’ve always disliked! Returns are also made easy and that’s allowed me to continue being a customer!",5
2930,"Consignment, but make it fashion: I’ve been using this app for the past year and I have really enjoyed the mix it has added to my closet. Things I never would have afforded otherwise. 
I wish the search algorithm was better, but once you know how to work with what it can do it’s a little easier.",4
2931,"Love it!: Like others, I am in love with Thred Up, and use it pretty much exclusively for my clothes, now! I would love to see more filters (like sleeve length for dresses, specific styles like classic or bohemian etc.) for clothes search since there are so many garments, but I love using the app and it’s services! Goody boxes are so fun! (:",5
2932,The only way I shop: I love using ThredUP! I try to buy everything second hand to cut down on environmental waste and save myself some money and ThredUP lets me do both of those things at once. I live in a rural area and thrift stores are far and few between so this allows me to shop to my heart’s content.,5
2933,Pretty good but a few search issues: I really love this app but I have a hard time searching by style. Searching by brand is great but sometimes it’s not as successful when typing in a specific type of jacket or pant. I think they are improving this and overall it’s pretty user friendly so I would still highly recommend the app.,4
2934,"Everything is great except photos: I love everything about Thredup except the photos. It’s difficult to tell what the fabric looks like and I wish they had more than just 2 angles on some things. There are several things that I’ve bought that I wouldn’t have if the photos had been better. Luckily, they accept returns, but if the photo quality was better it would save everyone’s time.",3
2935,"My favorite place to shop: The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because of sizing/measurements, they are sometimes very inaccurate. Other than that, I love it. I can find things I would have otherwise never come across.",5
2936,"Very good online consignment thrifting store: I like this app and the finds I can find in it, but wish the search features were more sophisticated and functional. E.g., if looking for a specific top- searching on tops,
Brand, scoop neck may show nothing but if you do brand then many tops described as scoop neck show up, but among many other items, so you have to search through them...",4
2937,ThredUP!!: I love this web site!! I brought some really nice second hand items (that look brand new)  Waiting for the rest of my order to come. but over all its a good site!  Trying to place another order in but it giving me a hard time.,5
2938,"Love this site, except.....: Trying to get a full accounting of my returns and sales would be nice. Like a total summery of my business.  But, other than that, it’s fantastic. Really good place to find your favorites that have. Even discontinued, and a great way to recycle things you are tired of.",5
2939,Scam: They take expensive clothes barely worn and sell them and you get 5% of the sale.  You’d make more money selling them at a yard sale.  Then they decide what to sell and what not to sell and say it doesn’t meet their strict guidelines.  Had items I had never worn not go on sale but upcycled... I will never send my clothes in again and I would never give them a dime for anything on the site because I feel horrible for the person donating the clothes getting ripped off. Sell on poshmark or somewhere else - you’ll keep most of the profit!,1
2940,The measurements are gone now: I used to love thredup but first they incorporated a restocking fee. I wasn’t happy but I could live with it. Now they’ve taken out the measurements. How am I supposed to know how something will fit without the measurements?? ThredUP doesn’t care though cause they make money on returns. I’m using up my credit and I’m out!,5
2941,"Do NOT sell your clothes here: What a waste!  I sent in my clothes to try to make some extra money on clothes I don’t wear as often as I’d like and found out this is a complete scam.  I wish I would have skipped the process and donated my clothes to somewhere local or even had a garage sale!
For example I sent in a worn once, like New beautiful Abercrombie and Fitch dress and they never posted it and said they didn’t “accept” it.  Wow really? I could have made $10 at least on it on another selling site.

They did the same thing with an under armor tank top that was in great condition.

AND THEN I have a Free People Tank too and made ONE DOLLAR off of it!!! It was $38 new and I wish I never gave them my business!

I would like to know where my clothes are that they “didn’t accept.”

What a SCAM if you’re trying to resell some great condition clothing... don’t sell here!!!!",1
2942,"Good to buy no to sell: I do not recommend to sell the bad experience of sending a bag full of things in good condition based on the comparisons they give you before sending them I thought it was a good option to sell them, it was not so I feel disappointed because of everything I send only  5 pieces were accepted, everything that was sent was selected under the required characteristics and even if they were not accepted, I would never send anything",2
2943,"Very impressed: I ordered just one item my first time using ThredUP to make sure it was legit. I was so impressed with my item that I couldn’t wait to find more things to buy. The way my item was presented, folded, and packaged was so much more impressive than I was expecting. Can’t wait to receive my next batch of clothes!",5
2944,"Very upset: I feel a bit beat up after being charged a price higher than expected. When I tried to cancel the order right away, I was told by a computer I could speak to someone “in a couple of hours”. I’m writing this review because it may be the only way to get someone to actually help me with customer service.",4
2945,"So addicted to this app!!!!: Thred up is my absolute favorite!! Everyday there is something new and the things I find are so worth going through all the things that get listed!!! I look EVERYDAY, because I don’t want to miss something!!! I’d recommend this to everyone!!!",5
2946,"Eh.: App works well.  Clothes are sometimes as described and sometimes way more old & worn than described.  ThredUP changed their return policy and now you pay $1.99 for each returned item as a “restocking fee.”  Money given for clothes sent to them in clean up bags is pennies.  Literally pennies.  Not much is accepted even when new without tags but unless you pay them to return what they don’t use to you, it’s gone.  I used to like the site but they’ve changed and made it less enjoyable.",2
2947,"It’s much better BUT...: The search functionality has gotten much better and easier to navigate which makes it great when I’m looking for a specific size, color, etc...BUT on the app I cannot scroll past a certain number of items. 400 searches popped up for me but I could only scroll to maybe a little over 100 pieces. Same with the website. Please fix this. I love ThreadUp but this is a shame.",3
2948,"Have only bought clothing: I am incredibly happy with this app. I only bought things from here, have never sold, but the quality of clothing is great as is the price. I bought a pair of bikini bottoms priced originally at $98 for $4.99. I love them! Everything was shipped on time and without damage. Would absolutely recommend to friends, family, and anyone who would listen!",4
2949,Bad: I’ve had nothing but poor luck with this app which is unfortunate seeing how so many other people seem to like it. Recently I tried downloading it again to give it another try but every order I make is canceled immediately after purchasing. So I reached out to customer service a couple times to try to get some resolution but to no avail. I think this relationship is one sided and it’s time it’s ended lol sorry thredUP but I don’t have good words for you. Wish you well.,1
2950,"Perfect: I am loving this app and it gets me stuff I love at great prices. However, sometimes I will click an item and it will show me a different one, and the “from the same seller” glitches a lot to where the same seller is under every piece of clothing.",5
2951,"Not Worth It: I used to love selling things on this app, but within the past year, they have declined for me as a seller. The “clean out” bags, which the seller has to pay for, take near two or more months to process, and then you receive cents on the dollar for your items. These are NICE items that I sent. If you’d like those items sent back, it is a crazy fee. The other option is they keep/donate them. I will find another way to clean out my closet from now on.",1
2952,"Love the store but the new app is so buggy!!: 99% of my closet is from Thread Up, but the recent changes in the app have made shopping on mobile awful. I am so bummed! The app freezes and crashes frequently, stops showing new items, and is a much less enjoyable shopping experience than the previous version. Really hope this can be fixed in future updates. Overall disappointing. :(",2
2953,Great find!!: This site was a great find. The selection is endless! I am able to find super low rise jeans that stores no longer sell. The prices are so low that you can’t help but buy numerous pieces! Not to mention the good your doing for our planet!! Way to go thread up!,5
2954,"Love it dearly: I love the good brand dresses I find for my daughter and mostly at a very low price , I love the bundles they offer and the more you purchase you level up to have free shipping after $79,$59 and $39 purchase also you can pay with AFTER PAY IN 4 monthly payments 
I find this very cool !",5
2955,"Longtime lover: I’ve been using ThredUp for about 7 years and love the quality and savings. Only took one star because I no longer see the feature in filters to search for NWT items and because accessories use to have its own category for sunglasses, but now it’s all mixed in with other accessories.",4
2956,"Excellent Source for Modest Style: I’ve found MANY stylish modest apparel (tops, skirts, dresses) items that can be up-cycled!  Also, the app is easy to use on both iPad and iPhone. I’m very grateful ThredUp as a shopping option to build my wardrobe. Honestly, I check ThreadUp before shopping anywhere else.",5
2957,"Great app: Love this app. Love browsing it, great experience all around for shopping. Great that users can order a kit or check returns/sell out kit, etc.
2 requests/concerns:
Recently wondering what happened to authentication cache... having to sign in every time I open the app often deters me from shopping. 
(33% of ppl will abandon an account entirely rather than to pursue the ""forgotten password"" process.)
Also, would be great to see the ""fit type"" be a filter in search, generally. To be able to narrow down to ""maternity"" or ""tall,"" but within a category, rather than browsing the entire Tall offerings. 
Keep up the great work, we love ThredUp!",4
2958,"Service is awful: I heard great things about Thred Up and friends who were using their clean out service, decided to give it a try. I ordered three clean out kits on June 2nd, according to the tracking number it was shipped out June 5. Come July 29th, I still haven’t received any of the clean out kits I ordered. It says processing time is 6+ weeks, well it’s been over that. I don’t understand why it’s takes that long to ship some plastic bags. Needless to say the experience has been disappointing.",1
2959,"Terrible communication: It was very difficult to get somebody on chat, finally got my issue resolved. It seemed great until I did not get a confirmation email for half of my order. I ordered a denim jacket for a boys size
4, I received a Disney jacket for girls with a giant Minnie mouse on the back. I received a woman’s large not a boys large and I received a jacket in “ great condition” missing a button and the rest were barely attached. Then I tried for 2 hours to reach someone and couldn’t. Finally I called American Express to dispute.",1
2960,"Excellent thrifting: This is my top pick for thrifting clothing for my whole family. 
 The app is easy to use, you can narrow down exactly what your looking for, and has great rewards.
If something you bought doesn’t work in any way, returns are super easy!!",5
2961,Buyer beware: Bought 11 items off the site after reading the description of each item. Every single pair of leggings I ordered came completely faded. Description did not fit the item and the pictures were made so it didn’t show. However the hoodies I purchased were in decent shape. Very disappointed and don’t want to see anyone else waste there money as 10/11 of my items are non returnable.,2
2962,Great items Ship everywhere: Every since I moved out of the continental US I missed thrift shopping. Love the ability to thrift shop from where I live. Amazing items and accurately sized and priced. Only down side is no men’s section :( would love to shop for my husband as well.,5
2963,The only place I shop!: GONE are the days of spending way too much money on a single shirt. I love that I can put together easy versatile outfits for a fraction of the price of retail. Not to mention- I love that I’m doing something to combat the fast fashion industry. This is the only place I shop.,5
2964,Got a bad hand bag: This was the best place to shop until I bought a tote bag and paid a good price for second hand then when I got it. It was in such bad shape I just put it in the trash I don’t think I can order anything else from your website.,5
2965,"Very Disappointed: I sent in a clean out kit in late July,July 27th to be exact and it still hasn’t been processed. I have tried talking to an agent 2 different times. The first time I was told that it would be processed in late October so I gave it til the end of November I contacted them and they said it would be processed on December 12th. It is now December 19th and they only gave me an option to contact them by email. This is absolutely ridiculous. Sell your clothes somewhere else because they’re not a trustworthy company.",1
2966,Great way to save money on clothes: I love thred up - I shop here almost exclusively. I regularly find stuff from my favorite brands and they have great sales. My only complaint is they have a pretty high shipping charge if you’re under a certain dollar amount. But you save so much on the clothes that it’s usually worth it.,4
2967,First time and love it: First time using and I cannot say enough how much I love it. Can’t wait to receive my first order. The style building tool is freaking awesome where you can browse for similar stuff in your size based on a look already created. It’s very very cool!,5
2968,"DKgmaw: I generally really like this app, but I agree with the poor customer service. I’ve had two issues. one top I sent back and said I had a $13 credit. Can’t find how to use that. Purchased a pair of gray slacks. When they came they had a huge black stripe down the sides. Did not show in the pictures!",4
2969,"How  do I love thee: This app gives a whole new name to thrift shops.. growing up if you had to shop there it was looked down on. But this app lets you buy named brands from all over, without paying for the name brand. I love it and will definitely be shopping more from them.",5
2970,"In Love!!: I started looking at ThreadUp for a cheaper more eco friendly way to shop. I have ordered from many different sites including other thrifting sites and ThreadUp is my favorite. It’s is easy to find your favorite brands, and quality is great. I am always on their site!!",5
2971,"Amazing!: No other word to describe this site! Love the variety and integrity in ratings.  Also, the on going various sales.  This site, with all of my favorite designers makes it possible for me to be able to dress professionally and beautifully for less!  Thank you!",5
2972,"Getting worse all the time: I used to love Thred Up, but over the years prices have gotten higher, the descriptions are less accurate and returns cost money. With the new app update, it only saves 4 of my searches so it is harder to find my favorite brands.",5
2973,"Very poor descriptions: I’m a first time thredUP customer. Ordered 4 t shirts. Instead got 3 light sweaters and 1 t shirt. All the descriptions said they were t shirts tho. So now I have to return everything and pay thredUP $17 to get nothing back in return!!! On top of that, the cream sweater had an obvious black stain on the front…totally unwearable!!! Really?!?! I’ll never order from them again!!! Def going to stick with Poshmark!!! MUCH better pics there and much better descriptions of what you’re actually getting!! Sorry not sorry.",1
2974,"The responsible, economical way to shop: Once you get to know this site and learn the ins and outs of searches, it is awesome. Returns are easy, shipping is quick. They could do better with details of garments, but if you know brands you like and how they fit, it is less important.",5
2975,"Carbon foot print reduced!: Not only is my shipping reducing the carbon footprint with “bundling”, wearing second hand clothes saves money and the planet. I get great buys, & have had great service. I have been using thread up for 5 years and have transitioned my wardrobe to second loved clothing for almost 80% of my clothes.",5
2976,"Thred up!!!: Love this site!! I discovered it during Covid of course! So far I love it, ordered several items and things that didn’t work our were returned easily. I’m sure I’ve kept more than we’re returned. I’ve even purchased brand new items with tags for  a bargain!",5
2977,"They steal: I’ve never been so disgusted by a company.  I take full inventory of what I send in as a seller and they blatantly stole a brand new higher end bag (think $150+) that even included a dust bag.  Perfect condition as it was brand new.  So it could not have been rejected for flaws, no way whatsoever.    Sellers- put return assurance on anything with value.  I don’t trust this company anymore for a second! The staff absolutely steal and you have no way of knowing! Honor system is out the window with these guys. Not a good look going public guys!",1
2978,"Love thredup BUT I have a suggestion: I’ve always been a thrifter and thredup is my guilty pleasure!

My suggestion is to make it possible to exclude brands like Lularoe with a filter. It seems like lately the stuff has been spamming the dress and top categories. This makes it really frustrating to shop.",5
2979,Love ThredUP!: I’ve been using ThredUP for years now. I love shopping on the app! It’s so easy! They have great sales and it’s incredibly easy to return items. I’ve used the clean out bag several times. I like not buying new and have even started buying clothes for my pre-school aged daughter. Use ThredUP! You will not be disappointed!,5
2980,Love it!!: I have just ordered my second goody box! I love the surprise and the fact that I don’t have to go to the store or pay full price. The stylist had some awesome pieces in my last box. Way better that Stitchfix and Nadine West. Get your good box now and you won’t be disappointed!!!!,5
2981,Love it!: Love ThredUP. Most of my clothes are from this site. The descriptions are usually pretty accurate and the clothes are clean and just as described. Great return policy. I love the clean out bags. They make selling super easy. My only complaint is the payout for selling clothes is very low. Don’t expect to make any money—especially if you’re buying!,5
2982,"Best Online Secondhand!: I just started shopping on Thredup and have not been disappointed! The fact that I can return what I don’t want is the #1 reason to shop on Thredup. AND the selection is HUGE! I also purchased a Shoe Rescue Box and it was great! Couldn’t have asked for a better selection. Thank you, THREDUP! I’ll be shopping again!",5
2983,"Great idea: Bought a bunch of stuff for my toddler.  Excited to sell our family's unwanted items....EDIT: Selling is NOT so exciting.  Just keep in mind you're not going to get much (like pennies) if anything for anything you send them, even your tags-on designer stuff, plus it takes 2/3 months for them to process it.  So just send stuff you would otherwise give away.  Also, you can buy new (on sale) carters, gap and old navy stuff for the same price they list here.",2
2984,Easy fix!: I have been thrilled with the quality and ease of use. I’ve recently lost some weight and was looking to rebuild my wardrobe without breaking the back. Name brands in great condition (sometimes new with tags). My favorite is the favorite goody box. It’s random from items I marked I interested in and returns are free.  It’s like Christmas!,5
2985,"Not bad but could be better: I wish you could see the countdown to when you get paid for a consignment item rather than just wondering after you see your item sold, I also think you should always get 24 hours to cart hold an item, not 24 hours here and an hour or two there. It’s confusing.",4
2986,"Great!: I’ve made several purchases from ThredUP and I love them. The app is well organised and has a very good selection of clothes. My only complaint is that there’s a $2-4 restocking fee for each clothing item you return. It adds up to quite a bit when half of your items don’t fit. Otherwise, I love the app and all of my thrifted clothes I’ve purchased❤️❤️",4
2987,"Not a fan anymore: I used to love thredup! They had great stuff with great pricing. Lately it seems that they have a lot of garbage/out of date clothing for much higher prices. An old navy tank for 10 bucks, I can go to old navy band buy a BRAND NEW ONE for 10 bucks! Super disappointed! Please remember thredup you’re still mostly used clothing.",5
2988,"Measurements: I love that threadup includes the measurements in the description of their clothing, but twice now I’ve had to return things that I was really looking forward to having in my wardrobe. Both times the items were 4 inches smaller than what they had in the description, so disappointing!",5
2989,"Pictures are misleading: I bought a Gucci tote that is not returnable. The photos had the tote on the mannequins shoulder and carrying it as it was a true tote.  However, it was tiny.  I thought I could take it shopping and carry my purchases.  Needless to say it is too small to carry on my shoulder and will only carry a tiny jewelry box.  Wasted $200",5
2990,"Pockets: Can you please add “pockets” to the list of embellishments (or in any applicable category)?  As mom, pockets on dresses and skirts are essential and By simplifying such a search means a much better use of my time, and most likely more items in my basket!  BTW- the necessity of pockets comes up in many a conversation with others... it’s a thing that EVERYONE loves.

Thank you!",5
2991,"Love it! Just wish picture can be better!: I think with 2 basic photos of an item to swipe is fine, just wish some more! Maybe the manikin also with full leg? Some dresses giving weird displays. You guys have great items!! But overall, it’s great experience! Just purchased 5 work dresses a minute ago, and can’t wait to see them!",4
2992,"Way better than shopping in person.: I have ordered large quantities of clothes from thredUP twice now and have loved everything I received. The site is easy to use and simple, returns are easy when things don’t fit, and the prices are unbeatable. A plus is the adorable packaging.",5
2993,All good things: I only have positive things to say about ThredUp. I've been pleased with all items I purchased with the exception of a couple things that were too small. Returns are free and were processed quickly and easily. Love this service! Also a great way to buy gently used kids clothes at awesome prices.,5
2994,Could use a bit more: I love the site but my one piece of advice would be the categories need more choices to break down like more filters. If you go to dresses maybe list long sleeve or winter stuff like that... otherwise I am having fun and I will see how much I like my products when they get here...,5
2995,"I’m hooked!!!: I heard about thredUP from my mom. She’s ordered clothing several times and was always happy with her purchases. I ordered 5 pairs of jeans and 2 pairs of shoes. So incredibly happy!!! They look brand new and fit so well. Quality clothing, excellent service and amazingly affordable prices! What more could you ask for? Thank you, thredUP. 🤗",5
2996,"No support for newbies: 1. It took months before I had a response (via email) just to get a Luxe bag. 2. After I’d sent my items in and they were accepted , I haven’t been able to get ahold of anyone regardless of the method for my concerns. 3. I had been led to believe that I could adjust the prices once my items had been processed and this was NOT the case. Most of my Luxe items that were described as ‘like new’ sold within days and I still haven’t heard from anyone. 4. I made a approx $15 on all the Luxe items. I won’t be using this again.",1
2997,"App just freezes sometimes/Filtering: I’m not sure why but the app often freezes if you click on something.

Please allow us to filter by waist measurement for pants!

Please consider adding higher quality pictures as it is quite bright and fuzzy if you zoomed in. Considering that the return fee is quite high we would prefer to know exactly what we are getting.

Or I wish they would offer free returns or lower the cost of refunds as well as the minimum free shipping price. Sometimes you just get things that are completely unexpected or something you realize doesn’t really fit your style. The clothing prices are relatively high for secondhand items.",4
2998,"Customer service could respond faster: Because I have a housemate that has the same address as I do, I was unable to utilize my first order discount. I attempted to use it on three different occasions, but ended up losing my items when customer service didn’t respond. I finally ended up making the purchase with credits, for going my first order discount. Would rate higher if allowed to use discount.",3
2999,"Best Way to Shop Second Hand: Seriously this is where I buy 75% of my clothes. I’m 24 and I find great stuff for casual wear, modest church outfits, perfectly broken in jeans, going out outfits etc. I’ve never sold to them because my sister takes my hand-me-downs but I can’t imagine it wouldn’t go just as well.",5
