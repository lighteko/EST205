To the buyer's credit, they did message me about the wrong address the day of purchase. I am usually on top of checking messages, But I was in the middle of a big move and completely missed it. I also shipped the item 3 days after the buyer bought it. Normally, I would've cancelled the order and asked the buyer to repurchase with the new address, but I'm just finding out about this now when the buyer sent me a message about it not showing up at work.
The tracking shows that it was delivered. I was planning to just refund and file an ESE insurance claim, but would they even accept it since the buyer did message me on the same day of purchase about the address?
Any clarity on how to best handle this situation would be greatly appreciated!

I take pictures on my phone, (usually 2-3 pics max- front, inside, back), upload them on my phone, then save as a draft and fill in the rest on a computer. I also do ‚Äúsell similar‚Äù so that I can have my shipping and return preferences the same, but I still have to change the title, click ‚Äúcreate Ai description (for Seo I suppose?), copy in my store disclaimer/policy etc, change the price, etc.
Maybe this is considered a fast route and I‚Äôm just lazy, but I often deal with thousands of cds at a time so the process becomes a bit monotonous. I also have experimented with grouping them as small lots but I‚Äôve noticed that 1) they take longer to sell, 2) I end up making less money than selling them individually.

I have a statue I'm trying to sell that ships in two boxes [the way it was shipped to me so all the foam inserts fit this specific configuration], but Ebay will only let me list one package for the listing.
The only solutions for this I see are:
[Not ideal] Artificially inflate the shipping charges by oversizing/ weighing the box in the listing so Ebay charges buyers more and I can buy a second label through UPS directly at the non-discounted rate.
I likely take a hit this way, but it's better than nothing.
2. [More honest but also problematic] Create a listing for the second box that is somehow tied to the first so I can get two labels out of it. If there's a way to create an invisible listing to avoid different buyers looking at/ bidding on them separately that would be easiest...

25,2024-09-02T12:01:11.934000+0000,Need advice on a damaged item from an international shipper. : r/Ebay,"Hello,
I hope this is the right place to ask and I apologise if this seems trivial, I just haven't dealt with a situation like this before after around 200 purchases on Ebay. I am a collector as a hobby of video games, memorabilia and merchandise. Some of the items I order are not released in the UK (my country) so I tend to have to order from the USA or Japan for certain products.
I ordered a sealed copy of a vintage game from a Japanese seller who has over 99% positive feedback. I paid a premium for the item to be sealed and in mint condition as I own sealed and protected games from this franchise, so condition is extremely important. The item arrived in a single layer of bubble wrap in an envelope. When I opened the item there was a large crack on the front of the case that is almost as long as the case itself. Based on the shape of the crack it appears to be made not from impact but likely from sustained weight placed on the item.
I contacted the seller and gave them photo's of the damaged item with the original packaging and said I would be ok with returning it or taking a partial refund (to match a cheaper used copy of the game). They responded asking me to upload photo's (which I already did) and to contact my post office for a damaged item report number.
I've never dealt with this before but looking on Royal Mail's website, it says that both a buyer and a seller can open a claim but it also says that if the item wasn't posted with Royal Mail that they wouldn't be liable. As this was posted via Japan Post and not Royal Mail, shouldn't the seller be the one to do this?
The nearest post office to me is about 30 min away so I figured someone might have experience with this that could save me the journey. My assumption (based on the speed of the response and formatting) is that this may be a copy/paste response and may not be applicable.
Any advice would be appreciated!

29,2024-09-02T02:56:23.239000+0000,Does eBay cover you for refunds if USPS scans your package as delivered but fails to actually deliver it? Going through a tough time with usps : r/Ebay,"I'm having a huge issue with USPS. They refuse to refund me for a cheap package (barely $22) and keep denying my claims and service requests because the package was ""delivered"" based on their system. It was scanned as delivered but either dropped or put in the wrong mailbox section of my communities mailbox (shared townhouse mailbox where everyone has a key to their section)
I bought six different videogames (different sellers) off ebay that all arrived (scanned as delivered) the same day. Problem is I live in a townhouse community with one of those giant box mailboxes that everyone has a key to their #section for. When the mail worker delivers mail, their master key opens every section at once so they can put each correspondence or package in the slot it goes for each address.
Problem is, while they scanned all six (which updates them to ""delivered""), they only put 5 in my mailbox of the six.
The missing package was small (a Nintendo DS game cartridge in a yellow package envelope), and it's hot in Florida, so I figure they maybe made a simple mistake and put it in the wrong slot.
The thing is USPS keep denying all my claims and requests because according to them the package was ""delivered"" and in their investigation (which is literally only them asking the mail person to give their word that they delivered it correctly).
I highly doubt it was stolen by the mail person because it wasn't anything super valuable or easily identifiable like back when ps5's we're getting stolen, but my problem is they treat me like I'm a liar accusing the mail person of lying without directly saying it.
The last rep I spoke to basically told me ""I don't want to say it's their (the mail person) word against yours"" but that's absolutely what they're doing.
If this is how they treat customers, it makes me never want to use eBay again unless the seller uses other shippers like UPS because USPS investigation process is literally asking the mail person if they delivered the package right and taking their word for it (which makes me wonder what they do concerning people who's packages get stolen off their front porch)
The last thing they emailed me (from a supervisor) was:
""Thank you for taking the time to notify us of your experience. Your USPS¬Æ Service Request (insert number here) has been marked as closed.
Package was misdelivered. Plese contact Sender to inform them of the misdelivery.
Please accept our sincerest apology for any trouble this may have caused you. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you again in the future.""
In other words, sorry we misdelivered, contact the seller for a refund.
But does ebay even cover this?
I could have sworn that if a package issue was caused by USPS then the seller and eBay don't have liability. Amen I wrong on this?
What can I do in this case?
Sidenote: do they do this to anyone whose package gets stolen at their front door after being delivered as well? Cause as far as I know id you don't have video proof they'll do the same thing they said to me and say ""well it shows it was delivered""

It had a military history and contained what is to be considered one of their most iconic movements inside.
I received it and it was a little erratic. Not terrible, but was plus/minus about 30s per day. To be honest I don't remember what the seller claimed was the running condition. I messaged him and stated that it needed a servicing, which it did and suggested that we split the cost. I found someone for approx $160 and he refunded me $80 on a $600 transaction.
In hindsight, though not completely clear cut, I probably should have been responsible for the service. The seller was standup, but also had to worry about a potential INAD (which I would never do) or a return and re-auctioning for a less final amount, plus shipping fees. When buying watches online, the golden rule is to assume any purchase made will require a servicing anyway. I was not experienced then, but most movements today I could service myself So events like these I learn from and try to make better decisions in the future.
I will say the value of this piece has doubled compared to what it was then, and I routinely see them selling for $1500 - 2k. Are there transactions where in hindsight you were the person who did not act appropriately?

37,2024-09-01T21:29:11.698000+0000,What is your worst encounter with a buyer/seller on Ebay? : r/Ebay,"Overall I have had a very good experience as a buyer and seller with about 800 transactions (more than 80% being a buyer. I have two that come to mind.
One: I am an amateur watchmaker and can service healthy watch movements, or rebuild ones in need of serious attention. I noticed an Omega Seamaster dating to early 1960's (I forget if it was Buy it Now or Auction), but I purchased the watch for about $600 USD. Seller claimed that it kept perfect time over 24 hours when kept on his coffee table and timed. I made the purchase and it was a disaster. The dial did not match the photos and it would stop and start if moved at all. I took the cover off and the balance (think pendulum of a wall clock) was clearly broken.
I messaged him and he said that it kept perfect time and if there is a small part inside that is broken, then why should it be his problem. I went back and check the item number history and it had been purchased and returned 4 previous times. Starting off at $1200 and HEAVILY Photoshopped photos and an an outright dishonest description. The think it this is the ONE of the very few repairs that I could not make as it require very specific, expensive watchmker tools. I did find a brand new balance for the model for $600 so I made the purchase and kept the sale.
With the new balance I was able to restore the watch to great working condition. The seller was very deceitful, and every time he revised his listing after a return he toned down the Photoshopping slightly and was slightly forthcoming until he got to me. A watch with a broken balance pivot may still work ok depending on where and how it's bent/broken if kept perfectly level (on a table, never on a wrist). Anyways I still have this watch today and it's in great working order.
The second story is a computer power supply that was OPEN BOX. When I opened it heavily worn with frayed cables, and very, very dirty. Seller never responded to my emails and I sent it back as INAD.

I sold an item for around 10k USD yesterday but I seem to have no options to ship the item to the buyer and I wanted to see if anyone here has experience with this.
I'm from the United States and the buyer is from Australia. The buyer sent me a best offer and I accepted it, however when they went to pay they are getting a message stating ""the seller won't post to your location"". Now that definitely isn't true and I have never excluded australia from my shipping regions.
I ended up calling ebay and found out the Global Shipping Program is only eligible for goods under 2.5k USD in value. If it exceeds that amount, which my product does, they will not allow me to use the GSP.
Okay, fair enough, but when I start looking into other options to ship this on my own I am finding all the major postal services don't allow me to ship this item due to its declared value. USPS states the declared value must be below 5k, UPS is stating it has to be below 2.5k, etc..
Is my only option here to lie on customs forms about the value? That obviously doesn't seem right...
Does anyone here have experience shipping High Value Goods abroad and know what I can do to properly devlare the value of the items when shipping them?

79,2024-08-29T20:36:54.499000+0000,Appeal a dispute or am I screwed? : r/Ebay,"Hello,
I sold a laptop about 4 months ago to a buyer, I did all of the correct stuff before sending it to make sure it worked and even got confirmation that it worked from the buyer. 1 month after the buyer contacts me telling me that they are gonna sell it cause they don‚Äôt need it anymore. They end up not doing this and 3 months after it was delivered ask for a refund because the laptop was ‚Äúmelting down‚Äù despite me telling them all the problems with it. Of course I say no. He continues to message me over and over so I block him. He files a dispute with his card company and one month later wins, because ‚Äúitem was not as described‚Äù. How do I appeal this? I‚Äôve gone and read all of the eBay articles which are of no help because they lead me to a dead end, and so does support chat bot. Am I just screwed and take the $400 hit? Or is there an actual person I can talk to?
EDIT: I just got off the phone with eBay support. They said that they could only appeal the $20 for the dispute fee. They said that I didn‚Äôt get buyer protection because I refused to refund the customer (despite being out of the window), and that they have no control over the situation because the buyer went through their payment institution. I‚Äôm not sure that there is anything else I can do. I appreciate you guys trying to help at least.

How can I make sure DHL handles my parcel? I trust them the most and have heard good reviews about them in my country. Unlike FedEx, DHL can help with clearing customs and any unnecessary charges can may pop up. Something similar happened with my model rocketry club where FedEx up and slapped up unnecessary charges cuz the customs thought multiple PCBs accounted for mismatch in price . Where as DHL simply handled most of it on their own and reduced our unnecessary custom charge to the normal duty rate.

Yesterday I bought my GF some clothes as a gift, via a ""make offer"", which was accepted. I was charged immediately due to the ""immediate purchase"" settings on the listing. Because of that, two things happened that I didn't want:
My ""default payment method"" was automatically debited. As an occasional seller, I have to have that set up, right. But as a buyer, that gives me no chance when I do a ""make offer"" to say, ""no, I actually want to use a different credit card for this purchase than the one you charge when I'm a seller"". You just get slammed immediately with the charge on whichever card is set up on Paypal. (Lots of Ebay chat threads complaining about this, btw.)
No opportunity to apply a promotional code (can't use the ""C"" word here because this sub's automod apparently will deleted my posting if I do). Would have saved 20% with their ""labor day sale"", and it actually would have been 10%+ cheaper for me to have paid full price with the promo applied than I actually paid with my lower offer. (The seller would have gotten more $, too.)
Again, I'm just venting here. And trying to remind myself, by writing this, never to use ""make offer"" again.

First thing I did was contact the seller and let him know I want to return the item and refund, opened around the same time request through ebay support, a day later he told me he offer 50$ back and that I keep the item as is, and I told him pretty much Instantly I just wanna return the item and get my money back.
From there he literally stopped answering any message Ive sent him for about 3-4 days, And today I was about to let ebay know the seller doesnt respond to my messages but the moment I open ebay I see that I was refunded, not waiting for your item to ship back or any kind of message.

Mostly this pertains to people who have won return cases against fraudulent buyers.
Plenty of my customers are dropshippers. It happens, so long as they pay my prices I don't really care much. Around the holidays they get more brazen and so I typically start including personalized messages to the end-buyer once they start having me ship directly to their buyers (like thank you notes and receipts), but the way I see it, it's free marketing. Free promotion. The end-buyer overpaid, sure, but it's a sale I got because someone else was out there pluggin my inventory. It moves items out of my warehouse and circulates stock either way.
However, this is a first. Sold an audio mixer properly tested, a fairly nice one at that, and on day 28 I get a return request for INAD saying it's defective. Image on the return is one of mine from the listing. Which it's not (defective). Tested all channels and effects with video to confirm before shipping. Checked into dude's info a bit, he runs an electronics store and website and half the reviews are people saying things like ""Oh, the first one he sent had a manufacturer's defect but they sent me a replacement right away no worries. Slow shipping but everything worked out, five stars."" So 'Defect' is his favorite term for things like that. Not sure what happened with his buyer, but I'm assuming he has to refund so he's expecting me to do the same. Which eBay will probably force me to do.
I messaged for clarification of his ""This item is defective and one side will not work"" claim on the return, and I got ""One side isn't registering and can only control one side"". One side of what? It's a mixer. It doesn't have sides. That's kinda the whole point is independent control of channels and input and output and effects. I ask for more details, he says ""One side of the board isn't registering and can only control one side of this board."" again, worded slightly differently. Ask for clarification explaining that it doesn't really have sides and I'm curious what he means, radio silence. That was Thursday. Touch base Friday, nothing, Saturday, nothing, Sunday nothing. Monday I message through the return to say 'Still waiting for an update on clarification blah blah blah' and he immediately sends 'One side of the board is not working.' Third time.
I cave, swallow my frustration as much as possible and send the label for the return. Here's my concern: I'm worried I'm going to get back my original unit with replaced boards. I know I can deduct up to 50% from the refund if I can prove the item was tampered with, but since I didn't want to tamper with it myself, I don't have the serials written down for the boards or anything, just images of the main serial and such. Do you guys think they would accept proof that the screws were misaligned or something like that as proof of end user damage? Or, for any of you that have been able to win cases like this, how? Realistically if this were an average Joe who had an issue with some part of it I hadn't tested, I'd have no problems refunding. But for it to be a dropshipper who will come out of this completely unscathed bothers me. No doubt based on the Google reviews he's done this before, is there any way to show that? Or, alternatively, if I receive it back in the exact condition I sent it out in (unlikely, I know, as it's been shipped, what, four times at this point mine being the first?) would that count as abuse of INAD? I'm looking for a foothold here.

131,2024-08-26T16:15:10.525000+0000,Seller wants to refund via PayPal rather than eBay‚Ä¶ : r/Ebay,"I recently bought an antique camera & manual from the US (I‚Äôm in the EU). Normally I avoid US sales as the shipping and import taxes stop it being cost effective. But this one was advertised with a manual which are virtually impossible to get hold of.
Anyway, after a little while, package arrives, but with no manual! And the camera that was described as being in great condition didn‚Äôt work.
Obviously I contacted the seller, but also straight away started the return process. This is where my question comes in. He wants to go outside eBay and refund me via PayPal, I‚Äôm concerned because I fear he wont refund me in full‚Ä¶ $80 manual + camera, but about $160 incl tax & shipping. I‚Äôm also worried that if I cancel the return there‚Äôs no way to restart it. Finally I worry about him just doing a PayPal claim afterwards and grabbing the refund back for whatever reason.
However, I got the below message and, if true, don‚Äôt want to screw him over. Is this the case? If so, what‚Äôs the way out of this without me risking losing it all?
I feel it necessary to try one more time. If we go thru eBay they raise my rates by 5%. That's hundreds or thousands of dollars in 1 year. That's because if we go thru eBay part of the refund comes from them. eBay does not like to give money away. I'm offering to pay you in full. eBay won't need to lose any money. I'm also willing for you to keep the camera. I realize this is my problem and not yours but I really need to resolve this without eBay paying out any money. I would greatly appreciate your help.

I read the best option is to end the listing and re-list the items via the ""Sell similar"" tool (which I tested and is very useful since it pre-inputs the parameters I had originally for that item, thus saving me time).
Would that be good? The only reason I don't want to do it is that I have at least 5-6 watchers on some of these items. If I end and relist, I'd loose those watchers. Some of the items are also very rare, so they wouldn't really get ""lost"" in people's searches.

137,2024-08-26T07:36:27.081000+0000,"Paid for a new phone, was sent an awful refurbished. Help needed. : r/Ebay","Hi everyone‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt use ebay at all, but living in New Zealand it can be hard and pricey to get specific affordable models. I purchased a gift phone for my mother as she needs one, but being younger, I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income and I settled for a Samsung S21, which was under the condition of NEW, I read further on what that condition meant and right there it says:
‚ÄúNew. A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable). Packaging should be the same as what is found in a retail store‚Äù
I did tens of hours of research on the model, and how to choose a seller, the seller I chose had a 99%+ rating, with hundreds of thousands of items sold. In other words extremely reputable. When I opened the parcel and took out the phone box it was shrink wrapped, red flag went off immediately as I had seen a dozen unboxings of the phone and knew they did not come shrink wrapped.
I figured maybe it was just rehoused but I decided to record the entire unboxing, including taking off the shrink wrap. The phone is absolutely not new, at all. It was missing all paperwork but the quick start guide, the factory plastic you peel off a new phone was replaced by some other ugly off-centre looking stickers, it is covered in micro-scratches on the sides, it had bits of sticky hard glue all around the edges coming from inside the phone, and there was COTTON or something of the sort, as a weird thread, sticking out from under the screen. The sticker on the screen is black, not transparent as is normal, and as I didn‚Äôt bother to even remove it seeing the state of the phone, I don‚Äôt even know how the screen looks, or the back for that matter.
25% of the phone‚Äôs price was paid as shipping and GST, but I bit the bullet as it was still a better price than anything I could have gotten here in New Zealand, by far. The price was also not ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù, it was standard for the American market. I‚Äôm quite distraught, and since I have not used ebay before I don‚Äôt know what steps to proceed with, and am afraid of making any mistakes. I see that ebay has the ‚Äúebay money back guarantee‚Äù on this product, but am unsure what qualifications need to be met, if I can get a refund, partial refund, and how much that would even be. If anyone could give advice or steer me in a direction I would be very grateful. Thank you for reading.

But for much less than I'd like, but hey, it is what it is...
I was selling an old Figure from Overwatch that was worth a little penny.
It was a rare variant of the Figure because it had a unique base, (it was a pre-release model for Chinese game stores I believe... I bought it a long time ago so I honestly don't fully remember!).
Anyway, I initially saw that a couple other people had the figure listed also, however they were all brand new unopened boxes etc. Mine was opened, so I had to knock a little chunk off of the price of course as that effects the value. The other listings were a little scattered as they always are, ranging from ¬£380-¬£500.
Considering mine was opened, but still mint condition, I listed mine for ¬£300, I figured that was a fair value.
It sat for a very long time, so long that it auto-relisted a few haha.
Over time I brought its price down to ¬£230.
Some time wasters later, I finally had someone who was a genuine interested buyer!
However, they were weird... extremely persistent and annoying.
They would me send long winded messages with zero formatting or punctuation, just one giant long string of words? It was hard to read to be honest! üòÖ
They were being a little forceful in how they spoke, insisting I take ¬£150 as TOTAL price, not including the shipping... (¬£150 would mean I'm taking ¬£80 off... (35%)) and the Shipping was ¬£10 Tracked.
I kept echoing to them a few times that I would be willing to accept ¬£200 plus postage. (it had sat a long time and I could use the money.) But this wasn't good enough, they kept pushing and pushing, and then ended up saying it was actually a gift apparently for their Son? And how if I could ""shake their hand"" with them on a discounted price it would ""make the wee man happy"", as it would enable them more budget for other items... (I didn't want to be rude and say that it made no difference to me... but like... does this ever work for anyone?)
While talking back and forward over night they would send an offer of ¬£150 (+postage), and I would counter it with ¬£200 (+postage), they did this twice. The next morning; there was 1 Offer left and they had messaged me late during the night, saying they would send an offer of ¬£190 and this is their last offer, and something about how their kids birthday is ""in your hands now""... I decided, ok fine, ¬£190 all together plus shipping, would be better than losing the sale and have it sitting for another year+.
BUT, when I went to accept the offer, turns out, they actually sent an offer for ¬£180.50 (+postage).... Like really? I guess they meant 190 all together? But like? Really?
I hope I don't come off as super stuck up or irratible...
I've just never had anything like this at all, nothing close!
I've been selling on eBay, Vinted and Depop for years now and this is a first!
The pop-up to leave feedback of course is non stop on my overview and I like to stay on top of everything everyday, but idk man.. I don't want to give them positive feedback because of how annoying they were.
If you report a buyer from this window does it effect your sale?

There‚Äôs a few cards that haven‚Äôt received an update in 2-3 weeks.

161,2024-08-24T14:27:39.310000+0000,"Tracked Shipping is actually useless, here's why. : r/Ebay","I was just thinking about that and came to the conclusion that offering tracked shipping does not protect sellers nor buyers from dishonest users.
Let me explain:
If I were to sell an expensive item (100$+) I would definitely require that the shipping service I use for this item to include tracking. Except, it doesn't even matter because:
As a buyer, there is no guarantee that the seller actually put the item in the parcel.
As a seller, that is not a proof that you put your item in the parcel, so the buyer could still very much claim it wasn't in it.
So basically tracked shipping guarantees a parcel is sent and received, but nothing regarding the actual content of the parcel. It is basically a money sink as it makes it more expensive for the buyer, and as a seller you are paying ebay fees on that higher total amount.
I am now considering just always going with the cheapest shipping option, without tracking to make more sales and profit. Let me know what you think.

I got heavy into coin collecting and I‚Äôve come across a few sellers that post that they are not responsible for Items lost in the mail especially if they use Ebay standard shipping. I have yet to have anything lost through more premium shipping or with Ebay send. However I feel like it is a pathetic business practice and not very ethical per se. I feel that when you choose to start an E business and rely on third party shipping with its known associated risks the customer should never have to be out on anything they paid for if the item doesn‚Äôt arrive. The seller should be responsible. As a businessman you can‚Äôt not deliver on something and make the customer take the loss it simply is wrong the seller as the one with the business needs to take that risk but that‚Äôs just my opinion what do you think?

165,2024-08-24T06:19:09.296000+0000,"Wrong courier used, no item, no response from seller : r/Ebay","Well, it's happened again. I purchased from a seller whose listing stated the item would be sent via Royal Mail Tracked 48 and that I would receive it between the 22nd and today. Out of curiosity I went to check tracking yesterday and discovered that the seller had used Evri; there was a tracking number, but it stated that Evri were still ""expecting the item"". I messaged the seller for an update, because I'm due to go away on holiday on Monday and there will be nobody at home to accept the parcel - seller has not responded. (this would not have been an issue had Royal Mail been used, because the postman has a key to my small block of flats and would have left the item safely)
I've just checked tracking again and there's no change, so it's fairly obvious at this point that I'm not going to be getting my item today. Does reporting sellers for misleading customers in this way actually do any good? This is the fourth time in a short space of time that I've purchased from sellers who have lied about using an inferior courier service!
UPDATE As of an hour ago, the tracking number of my order no longer works at all and I have still heard nothing from the seller, so I have filed an Item Not Received claim - specifying that I want a refund rather than a ""replacement"", because I'm convinced the seller never posted it to start with.

Nothing left yet - but am concerned. I had a buyer who was quite impatient when buying (good feedback, no major flags). He wanted the item by a certain time - fine. I always post either same day or next day - which I did with this item.
I noticed it hadn't been delivered, and now it's already three days late and has been flagged as 'insufficient postage' with a surcharge to pay to release it (UK Royal Mail). This is bizarre - this package was well within the size and weight limit for the postage (eg: was barely 1kg and the limit is 2).
Post office say that a postcard with the details has been sent to the recipient/buyer - I can't see/access or resolve this issue myself.
I messaged the buyer to offer to help resolve it if he sends me a photo of the card - no response...
I'm mostly concerned about negative feedback for something that isn't my fault - is postage issues something that is exempt - if you've sent the item on time and it is as described?

I had my eye on a dress for my wedding reception and could only find my size on ebay. It was listed as New-Without Tags and did not have any actual item pictures, and the description was simply just the name and brand of the dress.
(I know it was arguably very dumb to buy without any pictures, but the seller accepted returns for 30 days and literally was the only one of my size I could find across all the resell apps so I decided to risk it)
I messaged the seller after a few days without being shipped to ask for updates and any pictures as I was nervous, and she said she would send me pictures of when she wore it (never actually did, but definitely not a new dress then)
The dress finally arrived today, and while it is still really pretty and fits great, there were around 5-10 loose threads and sections with chunks of missing beading from the loose threads. It's not really noticeable and I'm sure it would still work just fine for the evening and look great in pictures, but what really bugs me is I ended up paying $20 (10%) less than retail for a very obviously damaged and worn dress.
So I'm not sure what to do. Should I message the seller and see if they'd be willing to give me a small refund back for the damages, knowing that it's not very likely. Should I just keep the dress and not ask for any refund or return and leave a 3 or 4 star review? Or should I hold off on making any decisions for 2-3 weeks in the hopes that the dress comes back in stock with the retailer, and then do a full return if it does?

204,2024-08-22T01:35:01.742000+0000,Seller was out of stock then restocked but increased the price. : r/Ebay,"I bought lego off of a seller and one of the minifigures was out of stock right after I bought it. I had promotional free shipping and paid tax. They messaged me back saying that it was restocked but now at a higher price. What they proposed was to refund me, which I assume is to pay the higher price, but also to pay for shipping and tax again. Do I just ask if I could still receive the product at the price I already paid for?
Edit: I messaged them that I would like both of the minifigs for the price I paid for. I was initially confused on why I should pay extra even after I already paid for it, but after reading the comments, I made sure to push to them that I want the products I paid them for. So if they decide to cancel I'm going to leave a bad review and report

Valid use of INAD? : r/Ebay","I ordered a part because the seller told me it was compatible with what I was trying to use it for. I did some further research and discovered it isn't compatible. I messaged him an hour after the order was placed and politely asked if he would cancel it. He argued with me all day and insisted it would work and I sent him the proof I found that it won't work and he told me I'm getting the item whether I like it or not and he doesn't believe in canceling orders. 2 days later he shipped it knowing it's going to come right back and refuses to respond to my messages now.
This really just seems like a waste of the time of everybody involved.

206,2024-08-21T23:38:17.957000+0000,"Is there a service or platform that you can connect your store to, and it tracks your profit? : r/Ebay","Basically what I imagine this service would do is it would firstly get you to put the cost of them item, and the shipping.
And then every single time you make a sale it would take note of how much you earnt, and then you can view your profits.
Does that exist? I work on small margin products, no more then $20, so my margin varies from $1-$5, but I sell I‚Äôm volume, so if this calculates it for me that‚Äôd be amazing.
Thanks!

So, I ordered an item over a week ago. It didn‚Äôt arrive and there was no tracking. Once I contacted the seller who was quite rude suddenly a tracking number appeared, However, the tracking number update doesn‚Äôt go beyond ‚Äòtracking number provided‚Äô and now it states there was an update in postage information but I‚Äôve checked and the tracking number still says ‚Äòtracking number provided‚Äô and ‚Äòdue to arrive by Friday 16th august‚Äô well, we are certainly past that. I‚Äôve opened an INR, will eBay rule in my favour unless the tracking gives any further updates which I doubt it will.

212,2024-08-21T17:29:54.108000+0000,Package stuck in transit  : r/Ebay,"Hi, I live in Puerto Rico so packages tend to take a little longer to arrive compared to the mainland US, but a laptop I ordered off eBay hasn't moved since the 9th. It was originally estimated to arrive on the 10th but then it changed to the 20th. Yesterday came and went and still nothing. I contacted the seller and they told me to wait, but the fact it hasn't moved since the 9th has me worried. Last scan was in the Jacksonville, FL distribution center. I'm unsure what to do now. Should I just wait a couple more days and open a INR if it's not here yet?
