10,2024-09-03T01:56:11.258000+0000,I don't get peoples haggling (a long rant).  : r/FacebookMarketplace,"I've been selling these Loblaws Marvel cards (if you're Canadian you probably know what I'm talking about) basically, you spend 25 dollars on groceries you get a pack of cards. But the cards are random, so I have extras I don't need. I saw other people selling them so I figured I'd sell them too.
2 bucks for one card. Given you get 6 cards with the 25 bucks, that makes each card worth about 4 bucks so 2 is pretty decent. Had a few sales go well, but a few have just annoyed me a lot.
I get it's Marketplace, you haggle. Simple as that. I've been doing Marketplace for a few years so I've had my fair share of outliers but man, it's like some people forget how simple multiplication works. I'm not desperate to sell these cards, I have other listings online that have been moving well and a good rating but I don't know these people just bug me.
I got this one lady message me asking how much 4 or 5 cards is, cause I guess simple multiplication isn't a thing anymore. So I tell her 4 = 8 and 5 = 10. She just says Ok Sorry. The end right? Naw cause she messages me again a few days later asking me for 6 cards. I tell her that would be 12 dollars (cause, ya know) and she says ""That is too much. Sorry"". Okay then.
Like if she wanted to haggle, maybe haggle? She just kept telling me she was sorry and it was too much, idk what to tell ya. A good haggle would be ""Do you think you could lower the price?"" but no, just more information on how basic 2x's multiplication has got you again!
Got another guy a few days later just text me ""I need the following"" most of which were not listed and I did not have. I told him the ones I had, and he wanted the general location. These people grind my gears the most. The ad tells you: 1. The Price. 2. The location of the seller, 3. The description and 4. The photos show what the product looks like. Like you can't be bothered to just read the ad???
Most of the time, the person is fine with the location and it goes off without a hitch. Sometimes though, they're like 4 hours away and wondering if I'll ship or deliver it to them. My ad again says I won't do either so why waste me time? Had one guy try and ""pay me extra"" to deliver a 10 dollar xbox game to basically Etobicoke in Toronto. It costs me more to take the train and public transport there and back, then to just look this game up on ebay and pay the higher price. It would probably be cheaper on ebay ngl.
To loop back though, the guy wants the ones I have that he needs which would be 9 cards x 2 = $18. Then no communication till the next morning when he says ""Let's hold off. Someone else has some for me for free"" why contact me then???? There's a lot of people just giving these cards away for free, why would you contact me in the first place. Like why?? It's just frustrating sometimes.
If you know someone else is gonna give them to you for free in a short turnaround of 4 hours, why contact someone selling them for money in the first place. And if the price was an issue, again, he could've haggled. Some things I have hard prices on but these cards are a dime a dozen, haggling is fine.
I don't get the people who also try and make me feel bad for my price with their sob stories. If you don't have 30 bucks to spend on a Funko Pop figure, I got news for you. Maybe you should wait to buy said figure? Just a thought. Telling me your kid really wants this graphic novel but you can't pay my ""crazy prices"" doesn't make me want to sell to you. It's a 10 dollar graphic novel that's selling on ebay for over 30, if you can't pay for a 10 dollar book maybe don't buy it.
I understand greatly what it's like to struggle financially and not be able to buy stuff. I know this so well. Which is why I keep my prices low. I research how much the stuff is valued at (Pop Price Guide, Brick-economy and Bricklink, what it's going for on Ebay) and I price my stuff lower because I know people can't pay insane prices but like these lack of haggling skills to either feed me a sob story or try and make me feel bad for my price is infuriating.

I totally understand things come up and people run behind, but like... you can't COMMUNICATE? Insanity.

18,2024-09-02T09:12:43.184000+0000,"Sometimes, you gotta have a little faith. : r/FacebookMarketplace","I have been helping my mum downsize and selling on Facebook Marketplace for a few months now.
Like most of you, I have experienced my fair share of bad behaviour from buyers. Rude, low-ball offers‚Äî I had a brand new Christian Dior perfume listed for $100 (RRP $230), and this person just messaged ""$20"", nothing else added. (Really?) Countless no-shows‚Äî I had a $2 limited edition mug attract three separate buyers, and none of them showed up. (Really!?)
At first, the no-shows annoyed the crap out of me. But I have since learnt not to get too emotionally invested when selling on FB Marketplace.
The other night, this guy was interested in buying a large number of DVDs. I tallied everything up, told him the price, and gave him the address. He said he would pick them up the next day at 11am.
The next day, he didn't show up at the time he specified. I thought to myself: great, another no-show, another time-waster. Did he honestly go through all that effort listing out over thirty movie titles just to f*** with me? It baffled me, but I moved on quickly.
I was gonna report and block him immediately, and then I found myself making excuses for him. Maybe he overslept. Maybe he got called into work to cover a shift. Maybe he had a fight with his partner. Maybe he got into a car accident.
Ever since I lost my father unexpectedly due to a sudden illness, I have been trying my best to practice more empathy. You just don't know what people are going through in their lives.
I decided to wait until the next day before blocking him. Sure enough, he messages me at 3pm and apologised for not showing up and said he was still interested. He came over within half an hour and picked up everything. He looked stoked with the DVD collection he had just inherited and was very grateful.
Even though FB Marketplace can get incredibly frustrating and make you lose faith in humanity, sometimes, a little patience and understanding can lead to a positive outcome. There are still decent people out there, even if it doesn't always seem that way at first.

After he sent me additional pictures of other spare parts, which I agreed to buy, and we settled on a meeting time (in a few days) and a final price, with payment to be made via Zelle (his request).
However, the day before our meeting, he decided not to sell some of the items and significantly raised the prices on others. For example, he literally increased one price from $250 to $2,500. Said he was getting lots of interest. Despite my frustration, I agreed to still buy the parts he hadn‚Äôt repriced, and he accepted.
On the day of the sale, after I confirmed that I was on my way, he messaged me with yet another price change and said he now wanted cash only. The total for what I was buying was over $1,500, which I didn‚Äôt have on hand, and I felt uneasy about meeting with that much cash given his weirdness.
I‚Äôm used to buying and selling in car forums where people generally treat each other pretty well‚Äîso I let my guard down a bit.

27,2024-09-01T15:25:17.072000+0000,Am I the asshole??  : r/FacebookMarketplace,"Hey everyone,
First time posting here. So pretty much there was something like very weird that happened with me yesterday a situation that made me feel kind of bad..
I have a toddler who is growing her clothes very quickly, and I often like to give her stuff up for free instead of just dropping it off on a donation box. I pretty much posted a picture of a bag of clothing on Facebook market to see if anyone locally wanted to pick it up as soon as possible at my house because I was in the process of just organizing my house overall..
I posted and got a lot of momentum. There was actually this guy that lived down the street from me that saw the post and he was able to pick it up in 15 minutes.
In parallel, I was also chatting with this woman and I told her I would like it to be picked up today .. she said does it have to be today? Sorry I would like someone to pick it up today. And then she asked me for the address and said that she was already on her way and she was 35 minutes. I responded shortly after saying that she doesn‚Äôt need to come because I already found someone locally that picked it up.
And then she proceeded to say that she was the way she needed the clothes.. I then said it was not available anymore.
Long story short, she shows up to the pick up location and starts calling me. I answered and told her that it is not available anymore. She said she‚Äôs a mom in need and would have really benefited from it. I told her I understand that‚Ä¶ however she had told me she couldn‚Äôt come today, so I went and gave it to the next person which was the guy that lived very close to me.
So pretty much the address that I give these people is like a corner store that‚Äôs very close to my house. I felt bad so I told her to give me a few minutes.. I was going to work on another bag. Because in my daughter‚Äôs closet, there was still plenty of clothes to give out.
Anyway, I collected a few items for her really quick and gave her the bag. I even felt bad because her daughter was in the back crying, her daughter was also one. One thing that was a little bit weird to me was why she was collecting clothes that was for 6-9 months old when her daughter seemed so big! My husband said to take these free item giveaways with a grain of salt.. a lot of people just resell them or send it off to their native country, which fine I guess.
But for some reason, I think I felt bad that she drove all the way here expecting some thing with her daughter in the back.. but I was very explicit with her and had my husband read the messages when I told her not to come.
What got me upset afterwards was that she texted me saying that the clothes don‚Äôt look the same as in the ad? I responded back to her and told her that I had made a bag just for her with other items that I had not sorted through originally‚Ä¶ like you‚Äôre welcome??? LOL

I was looking to purchase a couch and saw a great deal. The seller wanted me to pay for it upfront, I said no, he then wanted to deposit for me to hold it. Again, I wanted to see it before I bought it. He gave me an address two hours from my house, and like an idiot I drove to have a look at it All the time I was driving the guy was calling me telling me ‚Äúpeople are coming to look at it right now and if I pay a deposit that would hold it‚Äù I told him if he sells it great if not, if I like it, I‚Äôm gonna buy it.
When I get to the address that he‚Äôs given me no one knows who he is or has any information about the couch. This lesson cost only me only four hours snd some gas.
ONE: Never pay a deposit, unless you have physically seen the item and just want to hold it till you can pick it up.
TWO: If the seller only has a Facebook account since 2024 good chance it‚Äôs a scam.
THREE: Always check the person‚Äôs profile. If they bought and sold a lot chances, they are real.
Since then, I have followed these steps whenever I have bought (or sold ) items from marketplace. Everyone I‚Äôve dealt with has been super nice, and i have grabbed some great deals.

No, we are not willing to do a trade instead of cash. (Multiple people asking me to trade for a guitar I am trying to part with, instead of cash)
No, we will not accept a lowball offer after we have already listed a price well below market value. (A man tried to offer me 40 dollars for a next to brand new SSD for a PC that I never used, I put up for 100 meanwhile market value is 160)
If you set a time to pick something up, meet that timing. Don‚Äôt just no-show and not provide a reason. (A buyer asked to pick up hockey gear at 7pm, it is now well passed that time, and no further correspondence)
Do NOT give us the runaround expecting us to hold an item for you. The world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you. If you are interested in what is in the ad, then genuinely show interest; and make an effort.
This is just from 2 days of experience. The buyers in my neck of the woods are absolutely disrespectful in all of these examples. Why are people like this?

They are selling a few other random, but high value things, all listed for ¬£100. Listing said collection was available, and the map on the listing identified West/central London.
From the outset, I made it clear I wanted to collect them in person and pay cash. I haven‚Äôt haggled on price but asked a few things about their condition. I‚Äôve had to deal with a lot of scammers on FBM in London, so am cautious.
When I asked where they‚Äôd like to meet, they sent me a postcode that took me to a crematorium on the outskirts of London. When I pointed out it‚Äôs a crematorium, they gave me a street address.

So I graduated beginning of this month and am moving out this weekend. I‚Äôve sold a few things over the month and had one finally thing waiting to be sold which was an ikea dresser. The dresser was up for a few days and was basically in brand new condition (only had for 6 months) and is built. This girl offers $30 less than what I originally listed it for but I agreed. She then asks me If I can bring it to her (30 minutes away) for free. I said no üòÜ She then says it‚Äôs fine and will come pick it up at 3:30 the same day.
So it‚Äôs about to be 3:30 and haven‚Äôt heard from her, then it turns 4 so I message her and I ask her to let me know if she‚Äôs leaving/on the way. All she says is ‚ÄúOk will do‚Äù.. She ends up coming to my place at 5:15 which was annoying already because I had somewhere to be and was waiting around on her. She gets here and she‚Äôs with a friend and the friend venmo‚Äôs me and I bring out the drawers while they lift the dresser. Basically they were being a bit rude and told me I didn‚Äôt have to stay around when I asked if they needed help, so I just went back into my place.
I‚Äôm showering and getting ready to leave and I get a message 30 minutes later from her saying ‚Äúwe are leaving to go grab a uhaul it won‚Äôt fit‚Äù followed by ‚Äúcan you keep an eye on it and make sure nobody takes it‚Äù. So i go outside and look and they left it in the road‚Ä¶ So I answer her back as i‚Äôm trying to move it closer to my place and I‚Äôm like oh that sucks yes no worries i‚Äôm going to move it closer to my place. No response. The Uhaul place is 5 min down the road so i‚Äôm like okay they should be back in 30min to an hour, but now i‚Äôm feeling like I have to stay around because people in my complex will take anything for free. They also had all the drawers in their car just not the base of the dresser. 3 hours pass by and it is after 8pm and she texts me saying they will come tomorrow in her friends truck and get it. I said ok and let her know that I moved it closer to my condo. No response.
I get a text now the following day at 3pm saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find someone to pick it up for me. Can you get a friend to bring it to me? If not I‚Äôll come in 2 days and just get a haul‚Äù‚Ä¶ first of literally why would I ever ask a friend to lug a dresser into their car and drive 30 min to drop it off for you for free?? I don‚Äôt even know what to respond like this whole situation is annoying and the reason I sold it to her for cheaper is so she would take it same day. I have the money so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm stressing about selling it, but this is just annoying to be honest. I included the measurements of the dresser in the listing so it‚Äôs not like she wasn‚Äôt informed the size of it. she also really banged up the dresser yesterday trying to fit it in her car for 30 minutes so I‚Äôm not super willing to just give her the money back at the end of the day. What should I respond to her? I‚Äôm trying to be nice but she hasn‚Äôt once said sorry about the inconvenience or thanked me for moving it out of the street/keeping a watch out on it etc.

What happened to common decency? It's not hard to send me one short message saying you're no longer interested in it, especially since I'm doing you the curtesy of holding it for you.
I don't really mind people backing out, it happens. Of course it's disappointing, but just tell me.

Is it maybe because I enabled shipping on that original account? I tried to disable it and I did, but it sell shows wild results.
Also some of my listings get 0 views, which is another weird thing, yet when I post them on my alt they finally start to get views, I think I may have been shadowbanned or something since I kind of abused facebook by manually removing my listings from markteplace and manually listing all of them although I don't think their are any issues with that?

So I‚Äôve been searching marketplace trying to find good deals on all the over priced baby items (tummy-time mats, changing pads, bouncers, rockers, etc) for the last couple weeks. Today, I had a few pick-ups lined up with different sellers across the city. I confirmed all these pick-ups last night, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs been all that long since I had spoken to everybody. However, the first person I was supposed to be picking up from just never came outside when I got there. I had sent over a message (like I had told them I would) when I was on the way, and then again when I got there. It was kinda before we were scheduled to meet, probably by like 5 ish minutes, so I was like ‚Äúok no biggie‚Äù but then about 25 minutes came and went and no message from the seller and they never came outside. I get that shit happens sometimes, but I‚Äôm honestly pretty confused (and a little annoyed) about the whole situationü´§

Almost any time I have bought something in the past. Almost always its people that‚Äôs neither ghetto or a hillbilly. Meaning it came in suitable condition and was priced fairly.
I wish there was a way to educate these people that marketplace is not a business. It‚Äôs literally an online garage sale and the item is probably difficult to ship or not worth shipping.
The downfall of marketplace was when they offered online shipping. Fair priceing, searching, and availability plummeted. And it continues too..
Also have you tried searching for a private car deal. Goodluck they flood you with nothing you want thats out of your state and make it next to impossible to find locally for what your wanting.

He said that he is located on the bottom of the state, and that he has a nephew in the area that could pick it up. He offered to take a risk and venmo me before even seeing the item so no one else could buy it (plus it‚Äôs a super good deal tbh).
I said no please don‚Äôt pay until you see the item and are satisfied..
He gave me his nephews contact, i texted him and am in the works of arranging a time to meetup. His nephew is responsive to messages and seems to be involved.
I texted the buyer and told him to Venmo his nephew, so i can get cash for the item.. He said yes, he would Venmo his nephew. This checked when I texted his nephew saying ‚ÄúITEM IS CASH ONLY‚Äù and he replied saying cash is fine.
I did the old Facebook profile check, and the buyer, and his nephew both follow eachother on Facebook, and have legit profiles.. it seems legit.
I sold an item a few months to a guy, he had his brother pickup the item cause he was out of town. The guy paid cash and was legit.

84,2024-08-27T19:30:08.021000+0000,"First experiecne selling on marketplace, nightmare ensues : r/FacebookMarketplace","Hey all. So, some backstory.
I don‚Äôt sell on Facebook marketplace, ever. I usually buy things I want/need here and there. I try to be a great buyer, if I see it‚Äôs a fair price I pay up front and full, no questions. I tried to test my luck with selling a car on the platform.
I have the listing up, get a lot of inquiries but nothing really goes anywhere, or the deal isn‚Äôt sweet enough for me to entertain. Couple days ago I got an offer, and agreed to meet up so the interested party could look it over, take it for a drive etc.
We do that. Some kid and his girlfriend shows up. I let him comb over the car, look at everything under and over it. We agree to a test drive, and my first mistake is here.
The kid is gone for 40 minutes. I‚Äôm anxious, thinking someone just swiped my car. I give them a ring, they say they‚Äôre on their way back. Okay, good. . I won‚Äôt call the police then
So they get back, and the kid has the gall to ask for more of a discount. After leaving me in a parking lot for 40 minutes.
I‚Äôm pissed, but I want to sell. I work him back up to where I‚Äôm at, using his carelessness as justification for my hard set price. We agree and shake. Turns out he doesn‚Äôt have any money, and says he‚Äôll need a couple hours to get it together. I‚Äôm just wanting this to be over, so I reluctantly agree.
2 hours go by. All the while the kid is asking for a hundred dollars off here and there, ‚Äòfor gas‚Äô or ‚Äòfor registration‚Äô I tell him no and remain stubborn.
I call him and ask where he‚Äôs at. No where close. So I cancel the sale and go home.
This morning I text the kid and tell him what he did that made me uncomfortable, and that I won‚Äôt be continuing a deal with him. Blocked.
Shortly after, I start getting a flood of offers for the car, at the same offer we had settled on prior. I‚Äôm immediately suspicious.
This kid has gotten his family, and I mean his mother, father, brother, cousin, friends to all message me back to back to get this car.
I‚Äôm a little paranoid, so I bail on the listing and private my accounts as I have work friends and others publicly visible.
I‚Äôm kind of afraid to drive around town and get recognized now, as I‚Äôm not sure to what effort these people will go through to get this car they don‚Äôt even need. . Anyone else had an experience like this? Did they give up after a while?
Tl;Dr: made a deal, it fell through and now I‚Äôm being stalked online.

He was such a great pet, but once he was the size of my hand I felt it was cruel to keep him in a glass box, and wasn't in a place to keep him in an outdoor enclosure. Decided to find him a better home.
Posted him for free/gift, under the stipulation that you show me how to plan to keep him (didn't want him to go from one glass box to another).
Many people messaged me. Most didn't reply after I initially did, that's fine. One man in particular responds, and send me a picture of a hollowed out dining table that he put a giant piece of loose glass on top of to keep predators out. Planned to keep it outside because UVB/UVA bulbs are, ""too expensive."" I kindly told him basically that was not an appropriate set up, and I'd find another home- sorry. He immediately responds stating his daughter's were excited for this tortoise, and he put his last bit of money in the gas tank to make it to me (I gave very general location- city, state). Told me it's over an hour drive, and he's got a big 2500 truck, but he wanted the tortoise. ""I want that tortoise,"" was a repeated message more than once. I replied stating I hadn't agreed to anything, and those are the consequences of him jumping the gun, as I wouldn't give him the tortoise even if he wasn't being an AH. Nothing personal, move on.
Multiple messages asking how he's supposed to explain it to his daughter's, the daughter's are crying now, ect. I quit replying long before that, but I guess he was hoping for some sympathy? Immediately starts threatening that he's going to call Fish and Game about me selling it (posted for free) and the police for false advertising, lol.
Had a good laugh, decided to relinquish the tortoise to the Fish and Game program for the native tortoises anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As if you owe them a personal delivery of the item to their own door step and if you can't accommodate them, you owe them money.
I have no issues with you not being able to afford what I'm selling, but I'm not a delivery service and this is not Amazon. I'm often willing to meet someone within a reasonable neutral spot but if you're the buyer it's on you to show the initiative of interest and that includes coming to where the item is being advertised as being located, or at least in the general vicinity of that advertisement.

The set consists of a matching custom leather couch with 2 recliners, but only selling one of the recliners. Total it was over 6 grand in furniture. We ended up having another kid and quickly found out, this is not the furniture we need at this time in our lives. Definitely not kid friendly.
My wife's recliner was the cheapest at about 1700. The couch and recliner, which is what were trying to sell, is in great condition with plenty of add ons but I have no idea what return I expect on it. I believe we spent a total of 4-4.5k on both. They're beautiful pieces and are in great condition. We're going to go up to La-Z-Boy and get a bill order for exactly what we paid for.
I know from experience that 2nd hand furniture is really hard to sell, I'm just wonder what % of total purchase price I should be aiming for.

121,2024-08-25T15:20:21.541000+0000,"I've noticed that when I open a sealed, nondescript box, the items inside tend to sell faster. Question: Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon, or is it just anecdotal evidence? : r/FacebookMarketplace","My Situation: As a smaller seller on Facebook Marketplace (around 100 items listed and 300 sold), I sometimes acquire items in plain, unmarked boxes. For instance, I once had a brand-new skateboard that I left in its original shipping box, thinking it would be more attractive to buyers as a sealed item.
My Dilemma: However, I've noticed that items in plain boxes don't seem to sell as quickly. This raises a question: how do you balance preserving an item's ""brand new"" status (and potential resale value) with the need to make it more attractive to buyers? If I open the box, I risk reducing the item's value, but if I leave it sealed, it might not sell as quickly.
My Current Approach: I've been listing these items as ""New | Open Box,"" but it feels a bit awkward. I'd love to hear from more experienced sellers: how do you handle this situation? Do you have any advice on how to balance the need to showcase an item with the need to preserve its original packaging and value? Let me know if this captures your concerns accurately!
Note: The example photos I'm sharing (of the skateboard) are just illustrations of my point, and might not be the most relevant or ideal scenario. Please don't focus too much on the specific item, as I'm looking for general advice and insights. If you have suggestions or experiences that apply to this dilemma, I'd love to hear them - regardless of whether they relate to skateboards or not!

Maybe you guys can give me some advice? I've also tried listing it on Craigslist, haven't received any real interest there.
The post includes photos of (most) things you get with the cameras, photos of all three lenses (top, side, bottom). I also included a video. Previously I had sample photos instead of lens photos.
Here is the current description I have from the listing;
""Both camera bodies are tested and work great. Comes with batteries, charger, neck strap and grip. Comes with camera bag. Lenses are sold separately. Asking $250 for everything. Pick up at [REDACTED] Camas WA. First come first serve. (I did not put my home address)
I will not respond to automated messages.
D100 bodies are $50 each. Both are missing battery doors but can be used with the battery grip (which mounts via tripod thread).
18-55mm F3.5-F5.6 ED GII SWM is $40. 70-210mm F4-F5.6 ED AF Nikkor (non-D) is $60. 50mm F1.8 AF Nikkor (non-D) is $60.""

I will say a I responded to a number of inquiries - I‚Äôd say about 10 - with a slightly customized reply:
‚ÄúYes it‚Äôs still available. Would you like to pick up today?‚Äù
Most, no reply.
Some replied and said they could pick up, but never replied when I asked for a ballpark arrival window.
And so it went for a couple weeks.
I didn‚Äôt mind too much. It‚Äôs just a cat house I didn‚Äôt want. It was just $5.
I almost pulled down the ad, not because I was frustrated or upset. I just decided the chance of a deal happening was unlikely.
But this morning - nice and early on a Saturday (green flag) - 10th buyer reaches out. I ask for a the ETA and they respond with an ETA. Cool.
Buyer does doorstep pickup, leaves money under mat. Deal completed.
Update ad to ‚Äúsold‚Äù status, rate buyer 5 stars, add thanks comment.
What‚Äôs the big deal? The system works.
The cheesy, low ticket item was symbolic here, because people chasing such deals to save a few bucks are often pretty flakey. That was confirmed with the first 9 inquiries.
So what‚Äôs the secret to success on Facebook Marketplace?
Effective communication (short but detailed messages are best, maintain upbeat tone, respond quickly)
Managing buyer/seller expectation
Managing one‚Äôs own emotions and remaining emotionally detached from deals
Having the ability to drop everything and pick up item fast

I was selling 4 bags of nail tech stuff for only $60.
About 5 people reached out for it cause it was a deal, this one girl Grace (not her real name) reached out first and was ready to pay for it. Coincidentally Grace‚Äôs friend Linda (also not her real name) also asked to buy the items, I let her know that the items are currently about to be sold.

Come the time it‚Äôs time to drop them off, after she confirm her zip code and payment method, she was gonna pay Apple Pay once I got there. She ghosts me for hours, then I sent her a last message if she wants to go through with buying them. I don‚Äôt get a response til the next day mid day. Everyone else who was interested did not want to buy them anymore. Even Linda, who left me on read.
Everything was pretty much annoying, had cleared my schedule to drop off the stuff. It‚Äôs just annoying when someone wastes your time. And sabotages your chance to sell to someone who will actually buy the stuff.

So far I have been offered $300-$350 only for these builds and trades have been for mostly other computers.
However, I have had other sellers reach out to me and tell me that I shouldn't sell for less than $650, or $1000, or $1150. So I decided to reach out to some other sellers and see what offers they got for their PCs that had been listed for more than a few days. They all said the exact same thing: $300-$350. Regardless of age. Some were with Ryzen 1200s, one with an i7-6700K.
I ended up listing the PCs for the sum of their parts on eBay (sold and used). Immediately stopped getting any messages about it. Each PC is set at $800. I think I will drop price slowly.
Are gaming PCs just not worth anything? What are the buyers looking do with a PC for $300? Part it out? Or are they bots

And I said ‚ÄúSorry your house is too far for me and not doable for me because I have to bus even more to that place unlike the station that you mentioned in your post. So I‚Äôm sorry this won‚Äôt work out and I appreciate you giving me all the information and I hope you understand.‚Äù I have been nice to this snob this whole time.

188,2024-08-21T01:38:36.590000+0000,Veiled Threat from Buyer : r/FacebookMarketplace,"Few weeks ago I traded in some points for one of those Stanley Tumblers. I thought either to give to my wife or sell it. My wife had no interest so I listed on FB marketplace. Went through quite a few interested but flimsy people before a lady who seemed normal and straight forward. We arranged a pickup time but nearing the agreed time, she asked to pay by e-transfer and do porch pickup as I had my errands to go to. Fine by me. When I got home, the cup was picked up. I thought that was the end of it.
Fast forward to around 9pm, she messaged me saying the brand new cup I sold her was defective as it leaks. I was really confused as I didn‚Äôt even open the box to keep it ‚Äúpristine‚Äù. I asked for a video of the leak she is talking about. In the meanwhile, I went on YouTube to search for a product review to see if it leaks. The reviewer in first and shortest video I found says it leaks. The comments said it leaks. The lid has three holes for different functions/modes. I sent her the link and said the review says it leaks. Then she send me a clip of her tilting the cup over 110 degrees and the water flows out. I‚Äôm baffled at this point. You are literally pouring out of the cup and you think it‚Äôs defective? Then she started saying I sold her a counterfeit cup and asked me to prove that it‚Äôs genuine with a receipt. I told her I got this cup from a rewards program with points and that I literally cannot prove if it is genuine or not because she has the cup, the packaging and everything. She was not happy and ended the conversation with a veiled threat about how I‚Äôm dishonest and that I should be more careful about letting people know where I live, then she blocked me.
Then I wasted hours looking up fake vs real Stanley cups. I have zero product knowledge before this, other than this fad is going strong.
I‚Äôm just confused how she had ample opportunities to ask for pictures, or check the product before taking it home, and yet she completely went off the rails and thinks I‚Äôm the bad guy.

Another seller messaged me 30 mins before pickup to say that they weren‚Äôt sure if they sold the item already or they couldn‚Äôt locate it. Shouldn‚Äôt they know if the item has been sold??

Then in about a week the clicks will have drastically dropped and have 0-1 listing saves - and no I am not renewing or deleting/relisting the post. This has been happening with almost everything I post. Could these be fake clicks to manipulate the seller into paying for ad boosts when they see the views have dropped?

I recently moved and splurged on a new Dyson vacuum cleaner, food dehydrator, 2 flat panel TVs and a high-tech air filtration system.

Our town has recycling so it wouldn't be a problem to break down the boxes and recycle them. But I've discovered that a lot of things that go out in the recycle bin still end up in a landfill so any time I can offer something to someone who can use it, I make the extra effort to do so.
Anyhow, I put out an enormous pile of these boxes, snapped a pic, and posted on marketplace. I stated in the headline very clearly that they were empty. I also stated in the description that they were empty. I even superimposed text into all the photos that stated they were empty, too. Despite all of that, I STILL got people messaging me asking if the vacuum cleaner, TVs etc were still available. I got so tired of explaining what I already explained in the ad to these idiots that I just started saying yeah, everything is still here come and get it. I have a video surveillance camera above my garage that looked out over the entire pile and although I hate to admit it, it was a lot of fun watching people show up, pick up a box, look confused because it was so light, shake it (sometimes even opening it!) and then look frustrated and even more confused.

202,2024-08-20T13:51:41.315000+0000,THE NERVE!!!! : r/FacebookMarketplace,"Hi everyone!
I sold my Xbox Series X about 6 months ago to a guy on Facebook Marketplace. On the listing I said that everything was original, including the box and receipt, but that I wouldn't include a HDMI cable.
Well, after a couple of days listed, a guy contacted me and said he wanted the Xbox. Great! He comes, opens and verifies everything but asked for the HDMI cable. I said that the HDMI wasn't included as he have seen in the ad, but insisted that he only wanted it if I got the HDMI cable. I went upstairs and got the PS5 HDMI cable (since it is great quality and much easier for me to get, since the Xbox one was inside a cabinet and being used for other console).
Well, I come upstairs and offer him that one, since he is so insisting. He starts saying that I am trying to scam him, that I said that everything was original and I I have the cable but I wasn't going to offer any like listed because it was hard to remove the cable and was being used. The f*cker insisted until I gave up. Got to my apartment unit again (we were in the lobby) and he followed me to my floor. When I notice, he is inside my apartment asking if I needed help moving the cabinet. At that instance I wanted to cancel the deal, but I was really in need to get the money to pay for rent, soI said, sure, come and help me. He helps me move the cabinet out of the way, inspects the cable and says: ""Yeah, this is the one, I wanted the original because it is better quality"". Gives me the money at hand, leaves my apartment with the Xbox and the cable and leaves me alone to move the f*cking cabinet back in place.
Now, after 6 months sends me a message saying that he is having issues with the Xbox if I was willing to help him. I just ignored him... WTF was I supposed to do? I am not a technician and I really don't want to get involved. The nerve of some people man!

Well this one took the cake. She lowballed me and I replied that price was firm, never heard back. A couple days later she said her kid can meet me on the day I previously told her I was available before she lowballed me. Sales are slooooow right now so I still agreed.
Fast forward, she barely responded to messages confirming if I was still meeting them, they finally showed up a few minutes late and then sat in their car for a few minutes before I got a message asking what vehicle I was in after I already had given that info (they didn‚Äôt give there‚Äôs so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was them). The kid comes out and I show them the items and I get a message from her ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your Venmo?‚Äù wtf‚Ä¶ thanks for assuming I take Venmo and also thanks for organizing that beforehand. I send it to her, another 5 minutes pass before I message her and say nothing has went through, did you send? Her kid then gets a message and tells me the mom is wondering if they‚Äôre decent. Umm lady, you agreed to buy them, I‚Äôm standing here with your kid, wrap it up. My ad specifically states I only meet for purchasing, not browsing. Another 5 minutes pass before she finally sends the money.
I just had an uneasy feeling and sure enough, a few hours later she messaged me saying she didn‚Äôt pay attention to the details and they‚Äôre smaller than she thought, will I take them back. Then messaged again saying per my listing, they‚Äôre smaller and I need to take them back.
I‚Äôm always wanting happy customers so I usually work with people and she‚Äôs got me second guessing if I actually f‚Äôd up the listing but I both hand write dimensions on a card with details that I keep as well as have a file I write all the listings in and copy paste that into the listing - both were accurate from what I know they are, her number is super off. I am confident I did not give the wrong measurements nor did she provide a screenshot proof and the listing was already deleted to check. I blocked her as I feel like I was pretty reasonable throughout the whole thing and now it feels like she just wants to take advantage of me. She paid f&f Venmo but I wouldn‚Äôt put it past her to try to get it reversed.
The kicker of it all, this lady is incredibly well off. I always look into buyers backgrounds for my own safety and I can promise you, she did not take a financial hit. At all. Her freaking kid showed up in a $85,000 vehicle.
Long post there, but if you read it all, was I in the wrong blocking her? I could only imagine how well a return process would have went. She‚Äôd probably demand I pick them up and clean her house while I‚Äôm there!

It was a car part that was removed from my car 3 weeks ago since I was trying to get my car back to stock to trade it in. It was in working condition and I had listed it RIGHT AFTER it got removed. Fast forward, he came from about an hour and a half away and we met up. He took the item and his payment thru Zelle was on hold and was pending for 24 hours since I was a new recipient and it was a large amount. So I was like okay, I did not want him to come back again another day and I left the item with him and told him to call his bank after to remove the review. He told me we can wait 24 hours and if it doesn't go through, we can try another method.
Next day I woke up, I messaged him right away. Turns out he had already blocked me since I couldn't see his profile and the chat says I cannot reply to the conversation anymore. Luckily, I had a screenshot of his plate number and got his phone number thru his friends list and texted him (Which might have scared him), and he unblocks me like an hour after the messages were sent. He told me ""I haven't heard anything from you, did the payment go through?"" - note that I couldn't see his profile on my account but my friends could, stating the he did block me. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and he decided to pay me.
Two days pass, now he is saying that the item that I sold him was not functional. He said he had tried to set it up and he was not getting any power. Now he is accusing me of selling him a non-working item and that I had knew all along since I left the item with him even tho the payment did not clear yet.
Am I obligated to give him a refund at this point? He wants to return the item. I told him I don't know what you did with the item, and maybe he broke it while installing, or maybe he tried to swap some items and he now wants to return it to me. What should I do?

Yesterday, woke up to a message from my buddy saying he was picking it up for $850. Looked at the ad he sent me and it's the ad I saw the other day, seller had lowered the price $1250, and within one day of lowering price (not even one day, really like that morning), the seller was literally willing to haggle down to 850 cause my friend kept firm.
(my friend and I have a truce so we don't stop on each others toes for the same item, whoever sees it first, or in this case communicates first)
heck, at the end of the day the seller haggled himself, and dropped price even lower to $800 if my friend paid in cash
so my friend got a 12th gen i7 RTX 4080 pc for 800. Now he's going to just drop in his 3090 (which he also got in a lowball offer a few months back) and flip for $1000+, probably $1200 bare minimum.
So while I'm twiddling my thumbs, his lowballing gets him a very nice gpu upgrade and $400-500 profit.

I buy and sell a decent amount on FBM and have recently been looking for a new couch. Found one I loved, and asked the seller if they‚Äôd be willing to deliver, absolutely understanding if it‚Äôs a no, since it usually is. Instead, they agreed, and offered to hire a Tasker from Taskrabbit, and bill me. Then, when the Tasker cancelled last minute, they hired a UHaul and delivered it. They sent me screenshots of everything and extra pics prior to me sending a deposit (which I ended up doing sight unseen because I felt good about this deal) so I would feel comfortable, and communicated promptly the whole time.
They really went above and beyond and I was so grateful!
Everything worked out perfectly and now I have a beautiful new couch.
Miracles do happen, people.

Messaged me a few hours later complaining that he thought it was stiff but was regular instead. I told him to go ahead and bring it back because I had a ton of other people asking to purchase it. He brings it back. Shook my hand and thanked me for accepting the return. I ended up selling the set a few hrs later.

He also said I misrepresented the item. He said he wrote the review because it took me an hour to respond to his return request. He said that I only took his return because I had other buyers lined up. Nothing but gaslighting and reflecting. Lol he then brags how he‚Äôs a big shot drone flyer and I am only a FB seller.

So test it for yourself. Post a few new listings, answer to everyone (I sell mostly bundles so I have to talk to my buyers). If you ship, print your label quickly and get your stuff moving within 1 to 2 days. I have the feeling they track all of that now to start retaining & prioritizing serious sellers.

I am brand new to this sub, so I‚Äôll keep this short, but I am curious/concerned about a listing for my old vehicle I‚Äôve JUST made on FB Marketplace.
This is my second time selling on Marketplace, and my first time selling a vehicle.

248,2024-08-17T17:54:04.048000+0000,Facebook Marketplace is dying. : r/FacebookMarketplace,"A few years ago, many people thought Facebook market place was going to be the next eBay. Now no one talks about it. My first month or so of selling I sold nonstop and could barely keep up. Eventually, the views and clicks dried up and many people moved on. Then came Facebook shops for businesses. All the hoops everyone had to jump through to get one setup was ridiculous.
I've just listed my first item after one year. It isn't some random junk from my garage or good will. This is an item that is cheap, in high demand and sells very well on other sites. Even during this slow season, this item does fairly well. On Facebook Marketplace, it has been sitting at zero views at almost a week. Because of where I get the item, I'm able to get it cheap, meaning I'm able to sell it cheap. Currently, it is the cheapest out of anything on Facebook Marketplace for this model.
I also see the fees have doubled from 5% to 10% which I don't mind because it is still less than what I pay elsewhere. However, I'd expect those fees to cover building a better website design, customer service experience, marketing team, search function, etc. Even without the fee increase, Facebook has billions to put into this.
Even when promoting items, sales do not increase like they do on other sites. What is better, to take $5 from me in promotion and nothing more when I realize it doesn't increase sales, or to rake in thousands of dollars from me per month in regular fees when I am selling hundreds of items consistently?
More than once, I have seen that Facebook Marketplace has adjusted things so that your item only shows to potential buyers within a certain radius. In a growing world of ecommerce, I'm not sure what sensible company would make a decision like this. Less sales for sellers means less money for the site as a whole.
eBay is currently worth over 27 billion dollars. Facebook Marketplace could have rivaled this by analyzing eBay's failing points. Instead, Facebook Marketplace has become Craigslist 2.0. For whatever reason, they don't seem to want serious sellers and would rather have people selling junk from their garage. Tens of millions of dollars per month from fees they could have earned.
Am I alone in my thoughts that Facebook Marketplace is a disappointing failure, or are there people who actually make a decent living selling things without using the local meetup function? Personally, it feels that the ecommerce portion of FB Marketplace is dying a very slow death due to bad decisions. I'm legitimately interested in anyone who can prove me wrong since I am interested in doing business there if it is worth it.
